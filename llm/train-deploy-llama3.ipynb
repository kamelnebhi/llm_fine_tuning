    "This blog post walks you thorugh how to fine-tune a Llama 3 using PyTorch FSDP and Q-Lora with the help of Hugging Face [TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index), [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index), [peft](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index) & [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) on Amazon SageMAker. In addition to FSDP we will use [Flash Attention v2](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) implementation. \n",

    "_Note: This blog was created and validated on `ml.p4d.24xlarge` and `ml.g5.48.xlarge` instances. The configurations and code are optimized for `ml.p4d.24xlarge` with 8xA100 GPUs each with 40GB of Memory. We tried `ml.g5.12xlarge` but Amazon SageMaker reserves more memory than EC2. We plan to add support for `trn1` in the coming weeks._\n",

    "In a collaboration between [Answer.AI](https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-03-06-fsdp-qlora.html), Tim Dettmers [Q-Lora creator](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), we are proud to announce to share the support of Q-Lora and PyTorch FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel). FSDP and Q-Lora allows you now to fine-tune Llama 2 70b or Mixtral 8x7B on 2x consumer GPUs (24GB). If you want to learn more about the background of this collaboration take a look at [You can now train a 70b language model at home](https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-03-06-fsdp-qlora.html).

    "Evaluating LLMs is crucial for understanding their capabilities and limitations, yet it poses significant challenges due to their complex and opaque nature. There are multiple ways to evaluate a fine-tuned model. You could either use an additional Training job to evaluate the model as we demonstrated in [Evaluate LLMs with Hugging Face Lighteval on Amazon SageMaker](https://www.philschmid.de/sagemaker-evaluate-llm-lighteval) or you can deploy the model to an endpoint and interactively test the model. We are going to use the latter approach in this example. We will load our eval dataset and evaluate the model on those samples, using a simple loop and accuracy as our metric.\n",
