FSDP and Q-Lora allows you now to fine-tune Llama 2 70b or Mixtral 8x7B on 2x consumer GPUs (24GB). If you want to learn more about the background of this collaboration take a look at [You can now train a 70b language model at home](https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-03-06-fsdp-qlora.html).

    "In order to create a sagemaker training job we need an `HuggingFace` Estimator. The Estimator handles end-to-end Amazon SageMaker training and deployment tasks. The Estimator manages the infrastructure use. Amazon SagMaker takes care of starting and managing all the required ec2 instances for us, provides the correct huggingface container, uploads the provided scripts and downloads the data from our S3 bucket into the container at `/opt/ml/input/data`. Then, it starts the training job by running.\n",

      "Assistant: Hello, darlings! It's your favorite martini-loving socialite, Karen Walker, and I'm here today to announce that I'm running for President of the United States!\n",
      "Now, I know what some of you are thinking: \"Karen, you're just a rich woman who loves to shop and drink. What do you know about running a country?\" Well, let me tell you something, honey. I may not have a degree in political science, but I have something even more important: common sense. And well, honestly, you’re all boring and I’m fun. \n",
      "Let's talk about the economy - As someone who never worked a day in her life, I know exactly what it takes to create jobs and stimulate growth. We need to cut taxes for the wealthy and give them more incentives to invest in this country. \n",
      "As President, I would focus on the things that really matter to Americans like making sure rich people have the best quality healthcare, creating more jobs by having more servants and boosting the economy by selling more vodka and shoes. \n",
      "Let's also talk about foreign policy. As someone who has traveled the world and rubbed elbows with the most powerful people on the planet, I know how to negotiate with foreign leaders. I mean, I once convinced Grace to give me the last slice of pizza, so I think I can handle negotiating with Putin. And honey, tact is for people who aren’t witty enough to be sarcastic, and I'm witty enough to tell the world like it is.\n",
      "Finally, let's talk about the most important issue facing our country - fashion. As President, I'll make sure that everyone has access to designer clothing, no matter their income level. If I have to look at you, you better look good. If you're caught wearing Crocs in public, you'll be fined. It's time to take our fashion seriously. Pradas are not just shoes, and vodka is not just a morning beverage.\n",
      "In conclusion, I would bring a bit of fun and glamour back to the White House. Let's face it, politics can be a bit boring sometimes. But with me as your President, you can bet that there will be plenty of vodkas to go around!\n",
      "So, my fellow Americans, vote for me, Karen Walker, for President. Let's make America fabulous again!<|end_of_text|>\n",

      "Assistant: Jeff watched as his father got under the hood of the family sedan: a 15-year-old 4-door vehicle that had been with the family as long as he could remember. Jeff's father, a proud man in his 50s, looked intently at the complex machinery under the hood as if examining a complicated puzzle.\n",
      "Jeff stood next to his father and leaned over to see what his father was seeing. \"What's wrong with it, Dad?\" he asked him.\n",
      "\"Not sure,\" he replied, \"but I think it has something to do with the engine. There's no reason why it should just stop like that unless it were the engine. Do me a favor and get in the driver's seat and try starting it.\"\n",
      "Jeff, eager to start learning to drive, jumped into the driver's seat of the sedan and turned the key in the ignition. Nothing. He tried again. Nothing. Jeff exited the vehicle and walked back to his dad. \"What do you think it is?\" he asked.\n",
      "Jeff's father began touching things on the engine, seemingly actively investigating the source of the vehicle's problems. He pulled on some hoses and checked the fluid levels in all the fluid-containing reservoirs, then sighed. \"Hmm,\" he began a bit puzzled, \"This is interesting.\"\n",
      "\"What is it?\" Jeff asked, thinking his father had identified the problem. His father, without missing a beat, replied, \"The windshield washer fluid is low.\" Confused by the reply, Jeff wondered what the connection was between the windshield washer fluid being low and the engine not turning over.\n",
      "Jeff's father felt defeated and decided to call the nearest tow truck to get the vehicle towed back home. When the tow truck driver arrived, he looked at the vehicle and Jeff's father peering under the hood. \"Can you try turning the engine over please?\" he asked Jeff's father. \"We tried that,\" he replied but obliged the driver anyway.\n",
      "\"Okay,\" the driver said unamused, \"Did you make sure there was gas in the tank?\" Jeff looked up at his dad in amazement. \"Did you get gas yesterday after work like Mom told you to?\" he asked incredulously. Jeff's father, now with a look of realization on his face, looked at the driver and shook his head. \"Oh my god,\" he said in shock. The driver laughed uncontrollably.<|end_of_text|>\n",

    "Evaluating LLMs is crucial for understanding their capabilities and limitations, yet it poses significant challenges due to their complex and opaque nature. There are multiple ways to evaluate a fine-tuned model. You could either use an additional Training job to evaluate the model as we demonstrated in [Evaluate LLMs with Hugging Face Lighteval on Amazon SageMaker](https://www.philschmid.de/sagemaker-evaluate-llm-lighteval) or you can deploy the model to an endpoint and interactively test the model. We are going to use the latter approach in this example. We will load our eval dataset and evaluate the model on those samples, using a simple loop and accuracy as our metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: Evaluating Generative AI models is not a trivial task since 1 input can have multiple correct outputs. If you want to learn more about evaluating generative models, check out [Evaluate LLMs and RAG a practical example using Langchain and Hugging Face](https://www.philschmid.de/evaluate-llm) blog post._\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use the [Hugging Face LLM Inference DLC](https://huggingface.co/blog/sagemaker-huggingface-llm#what-is-hugging-face-llm-inference-dlc) a purpose-built Inference Container to easily deploy LLMs in a secure and managed environment. The DLC is powered by [Text Generation Inference (TGI)](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/index) solution for deploying and serving Large Language Models (LLMs)."
