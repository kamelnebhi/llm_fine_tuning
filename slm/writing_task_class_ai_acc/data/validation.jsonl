To address this, ship operators should ensure proper staffing levels and compliance with international standards like the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC).

Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Media has transformed dramatically over the course of my lifetime: from print newspapers and broadcast television to digital platforms and on-demand content. In the past, people relied heavily on newspapers, magazines, and scheduled TV programs for news and entertainment; these sources were limited, yet trusted. Today, I primarily use digital media—news apps, podcasts, social media, and streaming services—which offer instant access to a vast range of content. This shift has changed my reading habits significantly: I now consume shorter articles, skim headlines, and often multitask while listening to audio content. Although this provides convenience and variety, it has also reduced the depth of my engagement with long-form reading. Moreover, the constant flow of updates can be overwhelming; therefore, I’ve learned to curate my sources carefully. In essence, while media has become more accessible and interactive, it demands greater discipline to stay informed without becoming distracted. In essence, while media has become more accessible and interactive, it demands greater discipline to stay informed without becoming distracted.

[SEP] Response: Dress code at work\nIn the corporate environment, the dress code plays a fundamental role in defining the company's image and culture. It is not limited to the external appearance of employees, but also reflects the values, professionalism and even the identity of the organization.\nA well-defined dress code helps to convey a clear message about what is considered appropriate and acceptable in terms of attire in the workplace. This is especially important in companies that have direct contact with external clients or partners, where the appearance of employees can influence the perception of the brand and even affect business relationships.\n\nIn addition, a dress code contributes to creating a more professional and respectful work environment. When employees dress in accordance with the guidelines established by the company, it helps to promote a sense of unity and cohesion among teams, as well as reducing the possibility of conflicts related to dress.\n\nHowever, it is important to emphasize that the dress code should not be a source of embarrassment or discrimination in the workplace.

Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: In Japan, applying for a home loan requires a lot of procedures. The loan amount is determined by a preliminary screening by the financial institution. The financial institution will check your age at the time of the loan, your age at the time of full repayment, your health condition, occupation, years of employment, guarantor, and the results of a real estate appraisal. If you pass the preliminary screening, you can enter into a sales contract. Many documents and application forms are required.

According to a report, that price is about 1.4 times in 2024 compared to 2014. In Tokyo 23 Wards, the price is about 60 million to 100 million yen.  That is $US 416255 to $US 693758.\nAfter the Bank of Japan decided to lift the negative interest rate at its monetary policy meeting in March 2024, the policy interest rate was raised to 0.5% at the monetary policy meeting held in January 2025. At present, long-term interest rates are on the rise, so we need to keep an eye on future trends to see if the current movement in mortgage interest rates is temporary.\nAlthough in Europe and America mortgage it is common to use bookers as intermediary, they are not common in Japan.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, the ones I find most useful are FreeWriting, Focused FreeWriting, and Questioning. FreeWriting allows me to get past the initial hesitation or writer’s block by encouraging a continuous flow of thoughts without worrying about grammar or structure. This often leads to unexpected ideas that I can refine later. Focused FreeWriting builds on this by directing my thoughts toward a specific topic, helping me dig deeper while still maintaining a sense of freedom. I find this especially helpful when trying to understand my own perspective or develop a strong thesis.\n \nQuestioning is also valuable because it helps me explore different angles of a topic. By asking who, what, when, where, why, and how, I can uncover new insights and identify gaps in my understanding. This technique helps me shape more thoughtful and complete writing. While metaphors and symbolism are powerful for creative writing, I rely more heavily on the generative techniques like FreeWriting and Questioning during the drafting process. They help me build a solid foundation before adding more stylistic elements.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language students often encounter various issues and challenges that can hinder their learning experience. What are the most common obstacles? One significant challenge is the complexity of grammar rules. Understanding tenses, articles, and sentence structure can be daunting, leading to frustration.\n\nAnother common issue is vocabulary acquisition. How can students effectively retain new words? Memorization is often insufficient; students may struggle with using vocabulary in context, which can stifle their speaking and writing abilities.\n\nPronunciation also poses a challenge. Why is it difficult for students to produce sounds that do not exist in their native language? This can affect their confidence and ability to communicate effectively. Additionally, the fear of making mistakes often prevents students from practicing speaking, further impeding their progress.\n\nCultural nuances present another layer of complexity. How do language students navigate idiomatic expressions and cultural references? These elements are vital for fluency and understanding the context in which language is used.\n\nLastly, what role does motivation play in language learning? Students may face a lack of motivation due to slow progress or overwhelming material. It’s essential for educators to foster an encouraging environment and provide tools to address these challenges, making the learning process more enjoyable and effective.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: In my country, robots are increasingly being integrated into various sectors, from manufacturing and healthcare to agriculture and customer service. In industries like automotive manufacturing, robots are used to automate repetitive tasks, improving efficiency and safety while reducing human error. In healthcare, robotic-assisted surgeries are becoming more common, enabling precision and faster recovery times. Additionally, robots are being deployed in agriculture to monitor crops, automate planting, and harvest produce, contributing to higher yields with less human labor. However, the use of robots also raises concerns. On one hand, they can enhance productivity, reduce costs, and create new opportunities in technology and service industries. On the other hand, their widespread adoption might lead to job displacement for workers in traditional roles, especially in manual labor sectors. Personally, I believe robots can bring great benefits if managed properly, but society must invest in retraining programs for displaced workers and ensure ethical guidelines for their use. Balancing innovation with human employment will be key to ensuring robots positively affect society.", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Nova Espécie de Ave Descoberta – Um Parente Próximo do Pisco-de-Peito-Ruivo-Americano\n\nTestes de DNA recentes revelaram uma nova espécie de ave que anteriormente se acreditava ser o pisco-de-peito-ruivo-americano (Turdus migratorius). Embora geneticamente relacionada, essa nova espécie identificada apresenta diferenças importantes tanto na aparência quanto no habitat.\n\nFisicamente, ela é um pouco menor que o pisco-de-peito-ruivo-americano e possui um bico visivelmente maior. A plumagem do macho tem um tom mais enferrujado, com menos vermelho no peito do que o habitual nessa outra espécie. Essas características sutis, mas consistentes, ajudam a diferenciá-la em campo.\n\nEmbora habite ambientes semelhantes, a nova espécie apresenta um comportamento diferente durante o inverno. Ao contrário do pisco-de-peito-ruivo-americano, que migra para o sul do Canadá, essa ave permanece no país durante todo o ano — uma diferença ecológica importante.\n\nUsando o sistema formal de classificação zoológica, a nova espécie é classificada da seguinte forma:\n\nReino: Animalia\n\nFilo: Chordata\n\nClasse: Aves\n\nOrdem: Passeriformes\n\nFamília: Turdidae\n\nGênero: Turdus\n\nEspécie: Turdus canadensis\n\n\nO nome sugerido, Turdus canadensis, destaca a forte associação da espécie com o Canadá, especialmente seu comportamento não migratório.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility: A Necessary Commitment to Society\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is more than just an ethical practice—it’s a fundamental aspect of sustainable business success. Companies operate within communities that provide their workforce, customers, and infrastructure, and in return, they should contribute positively to these communities. This relationship fosters mutual growth, ensuring stability for both businesses and society.\nBeyond ethical considerations, CSR benefits corporations in tangible ways. Studies show that businesses with strong social responsibility initiatives attract loyal customers and motivated employees. Ethical operations lead to positive public perception, which can enhance brand reputation and long-term profitability. Additionally, sustainable business practices contribute to environmental preservation, ensuring resources for future generations and minimizing operational risks related to climate change.\nWhile critics argue that businesses exist solely to maximize profits for shareholders, CSR is not in opposition to this goal. In fact, responsible businesses often outperform their competitors because consumers and investors increasingly prioritize ethics when making decisions. Furthermore, government regulations alone cannot address all social and environmental challenges—corporate initiatives play a crucial role in bridging these gaps.\nIn conclusion, CSR should not be viewed as a burden but as an investment. Companies that integrate social responsibility into their core strategy not only contribute to societal well-being but also strengthen their long-term financial stability. A business that cares for its community fosters trust, loyalty, and sustained success.\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

I wish celebrities to promote more healthy lifestyle and show example how important to train, to eat healthy food, to take care of mental and physical health, to be kind and careful with each other. Another threatening situation, in my opinion, when celebrities participate in propaganda for money.

We guarantee that \"Zen\" will recoup its investment within four years and begin to make a profit within five years.\n\nRisk Assessment \nUsing a reputable insurance company to carry out a risk assessment analysis, we've factored any possible economic downturn into our projected revenues and profits. Our projections have taken into account all worst-case scenarios.\nIf the economy remains stable, the time required to recoup investments and realise profits could be cut in half.\nWe've already engaged Kudos Advertising Agency to plan and design an extensive media and advertising campaign.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: The Challenges of Language Learning\nLearning a new language is an exciting journey, but it comes with its fair share of challenges. Many students find pronunciation difficult, especially when the sounds in the target language don’t exist in their native tongue. This can lead to frustration, as words may sound unnatural or unclear.\nAnother common struggle is vocabulary retention. With thousands of new words to learn, students often forget terms they studied just days before. What strategies help overcome this? Flashcards, immersion, and repetition all play a role.\nGrammar can also be a stumbling block. Complex sentence structures, verb conjugations, and exceptions to rules can leave learners feeling overwhelmed. How can one master this? Practice, patience, and exposure to natural language use—such as conversations and books—are key.\nPerhaps one of the biggest hurdles is the fear of making mistakes. Many learners hesitate to speak because they worry about embarrassing errors. But mistakes are a crucial part of growth! Those who embrace errors as learning opportunities improve much faster.\nDespite these challenges, persistence pays off. With the right mindset and strategies, language learning becomes rewarding. \n", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Fighting broke out for control of the mineral-rich Argos Region, as well as between certain minority groups who were made refugees.

There are reports of executions, rape, destruction of property and infrastructure. It is also believed that Beta has established concentration camps as part of its ethnic cleansing policy.\n\nApart from the problems of the ongoing conflicts, there has been the constant threat of hunger for the civilians in the area.  Earlier in the year the weather was unusually cold and dry, which resulted in crop failures. In recent weeks heavy rains have caused flooding and the destruction of bridges, roads and rail links, cutting off some of the most vulnerable villages.\n\nAs a result of the conflict and because of humanitarian concerns, Chapter VII of the UN Charter was invoked by a special resolution with strong rules of engagement (ROE) to impose peace, separate the warring factions and provide humanitarian care. An Implementation Phase, involving air power supported by ground troops, will be launched at 0600 hours on Monday unless the factions lay down their arms. This seems increasingly unlikely.\n\nIn addition to war-fighting the infantry units will be expected to conduct humanitarian operations, to protect people and improve basic facilities. The Implementation Phase is expected to last one month and then turn into a Stabilization Phase, although it is possible that the war fighting phase will last longer. During the Stabilization Phase, infantry units will be ensuring peace and security while a new government takes over and NGOs enter the country to assist the civilian population.

They weren’t drones. They moved in patterns, weaving through the forest as if searching for something. Alex froze, unsure whether to run or watch. After about ten minutes, the lights simply vanished—no sound, no trace.\n\nThe next morning, he hiked back and told a park ranger, who just smiled and said, “You’re not the first to see them.” Apparently, local hikers have whispered about “the watchers” for years. Alex isn’t the superstitious type, but he won’t go back there alone again.

A well-known face can attract a larger audience and spark conversations that lead to meaningful action.\n\nPersonally, I think it is the responsibility of governments and national leaders to ensure that unjust situations are addressed and that no one is neglected. However, it is also challenging to tackle every issue that arises in a society. For those cases where leaders fall short, civil society must come together to provide solutions, and celebrities can play a crucial role in bringing visibility to these efforts.\n\nWhen used ethically, the influence of celebrities can inspire collective action and foster empathy among people who might not otherwise feel connected to certain causes.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Challenges Language Learners Often Face\n\nLearning a new language can be an exciting journey, but it also comes with many challenges. One of the most common issues is fear of making mistakes. Many students feel embarrassed to speak because they are afraid of saying something wrong. This fear can limit their progress and confidence.\n\nAnother challenge is understanding native speakers. Even after learning grammar and vocabulary, it’s often difficult to follow real conversations because of speed, accents, or slang. This can make students feel frustrated or discouraged.\n\nConsistency is also a problem. Some students struggle to find time to practice every day, and language learning requires regular effort. Without it, it’s easy to forget new words or lose motivation.\n\nLastly, some learners find grammar confusing and overwhelming, especially when it’s very different from their native language.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, students should remember that making mistakes is part of the process. Practice, patience, and exposure to real-life situations can make a big difference. Everyone learns at their own pace, and persistence always pays off.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: To be a good leader, certain qualities are very important. First, a leader must have good communication skills, meaning they can explain ideas clearly and listen to others. This helps build trust and understanding among a team. Second, a leader should be confident but also humble. Confidence helps with decision-making, while humility allows a leader to accept mistakes and learn from them.\n\nI once worked with a leader who showed these qualities during a difficult project. We had a tight deadline, and the team was feeling stressed. Our leader stepped in, calmly explaining the situation and giving clear instructions. He also took the time to listen to each team member’s concerns, showing real empathy. When things went wrong, he didn’t blame anyone but helped us find solutions together. His confidence in handling the pressure made us all feel more motivated to do our best.\n\nI believe most people have the potential to be a leader. Leadership skills can be developed over time with practice and experience. Not everyone will become a top leader, but many can take on leadership roles in different situations. The key is a willingness to learn and grow.", "task_id": "ce3f3898-f2a7-4978-8f4f-17596f229f1d", "level_title": "12-Upper Intermediate", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: The whole concept of celebrity has become increasingly problematic, especially when we focus on individuals who seem to thrive solely on their public image rather than any notable talent or contribution to society. One such example is the reality TV star, whose only claim to fame is being famous for being famous. This trend encourages a shallow, superficial culture where individuals are idolized for their looks, wealth, and drama-filled lives rather than their intelligence, creativity, or efforts to make a meaningful difference in the world. The constant media attention they receive can be seen as an unhealthy obsession, distracting society from more important issues. Furthermore, many of these celebrities seem to lack the responsibility that comes with their influence. They often promote unrealistic standards of beauty, wealth, and success, which can contribute to mental health issues among vulnerable followers. Instead of using their platforms for meaningful causes, they often focus on self-promotion and perpetuating a culture of excess. This not only undermines the true potential of celebrity but also reinforces harmful societal values.\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Eventually, though, we ended up back in St. Louis, where we've been living for the past year.\n\nI'm working for a design firm, and Stella has been teaching in a university. We bought a little two-bedroom house in the suburbs, and we're basically happy, but sometimes we feel that something's missing. The suburbs are crowded, and the houses all look the same. Jeremy left for college, so we're lonely, old empty nesters looking for a change. We're actually thinking about adopting a child. At our age, are we crazy?\n\nAnyway, let's reconnect.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: A Leap of Faith: Raghav Sharma's Skydiving Adventure\n\nRaghav Sharma, a traditional Brahmin from Karnataka, decided to take a leap of faith by enrolling in an Accelerated Free Fall (AFF) skydiving course. Known for his calm demeanor and spiritual inclinations, Raghav surprised everyone with his adventurous spirit. His family, initially apprehensive, eventually supported his decision.\n\nThe AFF course was intense, involving rigorous ground training and multiple tandem jumps. Raghav's instructors were impressed by his dedication and quick learning. He mastered the techniques of body positioning, altitude awareness, and emergency procedures with ease. His spiritual practices seemed to help him stay focused and calm under pressure.\n\nThe day of the solo jump finally arrived. As Raghav boarded the plane, he felt a rush of adrenaline. The view from the aircraft was breathtaking, but there was no time to admire it. At 12,000 feet, the door opened, and Raghav took a deep breath. With a final nod from his instructor, he leaped into the void.\n\nThe initial free fall was exhilarating. The wind roared past him as he plummeted towards the earth at terminal velocity. Raghav's training kicked in, and he maintained a stable position, enjoying the sensation of weightlessness. At 5,000 feet, he deployed his parachute, and the sudden deceleration was both jarring and thrilling.\n\nAs he floated gently down, Raghav took in the stunning panorama below. The fields, rivers, and towns looked like a patchwork quilt from his vantage point. The sense of accomplishment and freedom was overwhelming. He had faced his fears and emerged victorious.\n\nRaghav's skydiving adventure became the talk of the town. His story inspired many to step out of their comfort zones and pursue their dreams. For Raghav, the experience was not just about the thrill of the jump but also a spiritual journey that taught him the importance of courage, determination, and living life to the fullest.", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: To lead a celebrity life, you must keep your reputation in check and always treat others with respect. Maintain an active social media presence. Celebrities often amass huge followings on social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram. Express yourself authentically, and your fans will find you. It seems like celebrities get a lot of perks such as being brand ambassadors for big brands, having access to exclusive parties and events, walking the red carpet and attending the Met Gala, and of course the money that comes with it. This all looks really attractive to regular people. However, this all comes with a price that we often tend to ignore until we face the harsh reality. \"Being famous\" may seem like a glamorous and desirable lifestyle, but the reality is often much different. The lack of privacy, high expectations, limited freedom, lack of genuine relationships, and mental health challenges can make being famous a very difficult and overwhelming experience.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}

They should also be taking timely day offs so that they can spend some time with their family or friends.\n\n4) Ignoring Feedback: Avoid dismissing team members' feedback or concerns, as this can lead to disengagement and a lack of trust.

Sarah, an avid nature lover, was excited to explore a new trail she had read about online. Little did she know, this hike would turn into an unexpected adventure.\n\nAs she reached the halfway point of the trail, Sarah noticed dark clouds gathering in the sky. Within minutes, a sudden downpour began, turning the trail into a slippery mess. Determined to continue, she pressed on, carefully navigating the muddy path. Just as she was about to turn back, she stumbled upon a small, hidden waterfall cascading down the rocks. The sight was breathtaking, and Sarah felt a sense of accomplishment for pushing through the challenging conditions.\n\nTo top it off, she met a group of fellow hikers who were also caught in the rain. They shared stories, snacks, and laughter, making the experience even more memorable. By the time Sarah returned home, she was soaked but exhilarated, with a new story to tell and a reminder of the beauty that can be found in unexpected moments.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this little story!

Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Media has changed drastically in my lifetime. Before, traditional forms of media—such as newspapers, magazines, and television—were the primary sources of news and entertainment. People relied on daily newspapers to stay informed, while television channels provided scheduled programs that we had to wait for. Now, the digital age has completely transformed how we consume media: social media platforms, online news websites, and streaming services dominate our daily lives.  \n\nI used to read printed newspapers regularly; however, today, I rely on news apps and websites for real-time updates. Similarly, books and magazines have been largely replaced by e-books and digital publications. This shift has affected my reading habits significantly: while I used to read longer articles or books at a slower pace, I now skim through multiple short articles, headlines, and social media posts in a matter of minutes.  \n\nAnother major change is interactivity. Earlier, media was one-sided—readers and viewers consumed content passively. Now, social media allows instant feedback: people can comment, share opinions, and even create their own content. While this has made information more accessible, it has also led to challenges such as misinformation and reduced attention spans. Despite these changes, media continues to evolve, shaping the way we think and engage with the world.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become a significant topic in recent years, with many arguing that companies should have a responsibility to society beyond just maximizing profits. I firmly believe that companies do have a responsibility to society, and this responsibility goes hand in hand with their financial goals.\nBusinesses do not operate in a vacuum. They rely on communities for their resources, workforce, and customers. Companies benefit from being part of a community, and in return, they should contribute to the welfare of that community. CSR efforts such as supporting local initiatives, implementing sustainable practices, and offering fair wages can help secure long-term success for the business while benefiting society as a whole. Furthermore, consumers are increasingly concerned about how companies behave, rewarding those with strong CSR practices with loyalty, which in turn contributes to the company's bottom line.\nHowever, I understand the perspective presented by critics, who argue that a company’s primary responsibility is to its shareholders and not societal expectations. While it is true that businesses must prioritize profitability, this does not exclude them from making positive contributions to the world around them. CSR is not about diverting all resources away from profits, but about balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability.\nIn conclusion, CSR should be seen not as an optional expense, but as a crucial part of a company's strategy. When implemented properly, it benefits both the company and society, ensuring a sustainable future for both.

The server wants to make sure you get exactly what you want and that you are pleased with your food.\nAfter you've eaten, you may still have some food on your plate. That's fine. Your server might ask 'Would you like to take that home with you?' If you do want to take the food home to eat later, the server will put the food in a package 'to go.'\nFinally, it's important to give your server a tip before you leave. Servers usually expect a tip that is at least 15 percent of the bill, but customers sometimes leave a 20 percent tip for excellent service.", "task_id": "f7a3382d-3200-40de-98ed-11b7fe56a550", "level_title": "9-Intermediate", "label": 0}

Now, the landscape is vastly different: social media platforms, online news outlets, and streaming services have become the go-to mediums for information and entertainment. With this shift, my reading habits have changed considerably. I used to dedicate time to physical books and newspapers; now, I consume most content online, often in shorter, more fragmented formats.

[SEP] Response: While I understand that celebrities play a major role in entertainment and culture, I believe the idea of celebrity has become excessive and sometimes harmful. To be honest, I find it hard to justify the enormous influence that some celebrities have, especially when it isn’t backed by talent or meaningful contributions. For example, certain reality TV stars become famous simply for being wealthy or dramatic, rather than for doing anything particularly impressive. It seems to me that society puts too much value on image and not enough on character or actions.\n\nWhat bothers me the most is how some celebrities use their platforms irresponsibly. Instead of promoting education, health, or kindness, they often focus on luxury and appearance, setting unrealistic standards for their fans. I’m not saying all celebrities are like this—some use their fame for good causes—but many seem to be more interested in staying relevant than in making a real difference. In my opinion, we should be more critical of who we admire and why, and place more attention on people who truly contribute to society in meaningful ways.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Instead, a simile compares the two things/people using comparison words such as “as,” “than,” or “like” (e.g., “my dog behaves like a demon\nAn example of personification is the sentence “The rusty hinge screamed every time the door opened.” Here, the hinge is described as “screaming,” which is a human action associated with expressing pain or distress.

Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home in India can be both exciting and challenging. The process involves several steps, including choosing a property, securing a home loan, and completing legal formalities. Housing prices vary significantly based on location, with metro cities like Mumbai and Delhi being quite expensive compared to smaller towns.  \n\nApplying for a home loan in India requires substantial paperwork. Banks and financial institutions typically ask for proof of identity, income, employment details, property documents, and credit history. The process can take a few weeks, depending on the lender and the applicant’s financial profile. Interest rates generally range between 8% and 9.5%, influenced by the applicant’s credit score, loan tenure, and the bank’s policies.  \n\nWhile it’s not mandatory to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker, many buyers prefer working with them to navigate the complex legal and financial aspects of home buying. Agents help find suitable properties, negotiate prices, and handle paperwork, while mortgage brokers assist in comparing loan options.  \n\nOverall, purchasing a home in India requires careful planning, financial discipline, and patience. With rising property prices and high loan requirements, affordability can be a concern for many first-time buyers. However, government schemes like PMAY (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana) offer subsidies, making homeownership more accessible for eligible individuals.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a landmark trade pact signed in 1992 by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, which came into effect on January 1, 1994. NAFTA aimed to eliminate most tariffs and trade barriers on products and services exchanged between these three countries, effectively creating one of the largest free-trade zones in the world. The agreement facilitated the free movement of goods, services, and investments, leading to increased economic integration and cooperation among the member countries. NAFTA's provisions included the gradual reduction of tariffs, customs duties, and other trade barriers, with some tariffs being removed immediately and others over a period of up to 15 years. The agreement also ensured duty-free access for a wide range of manufactured goods and commodities. While NAFTA significantly boosted trade and investment among the member countries, it also faced criticism and political opposition, particularly concerning its impact on employment and the environment. Despite these challenges, most economic analyses indicated that NAFTA was beneficial to the North American economies and the average citizen. In 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which updated and revised many of the original provisions to better address contemporary trade issues", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Society and Leisure [SEP] Prompt: You are a life coach. It's your job to advise people on their lifestyle choices. You're in a consultation with a new client, Pete. Listen to him describe his lifestyle and take notes. [SEP] Response: Key industry players\nMost of the pharmaceutical industry is concentrated in developed regions – the U.S., Europe and Japan. The market is characterized by complex national regulations and consolidation among the largest international groups.  An important reason for these mergers is the need for economies of scale, as well as the increasing amount of money dedicated to research and development (R&D).\n\nGlaxoSmithKline\nGlaxoSmithKline is a leading company focusing on research. The company was formed in 2000 through the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. Their headquarters are in the U.K., and their operations are based in the U.S. It employs more than 90,000 people worldwide and has offices in nearly every country of the world. This pharmaceutical giant holds an estimated 7 percent of the world's pharmaceutical market.\n\nConcentrating on four therapeutic areas (anti-infectives, central nervous system, respiratory and gastro-metabolic), among its most prominent products are Paxil, for depression, and Advair, for asthma. GSK is a leader in the vaccine area and has a growing portfolio of oncology products, including Hycamtin and Zofran for treating cancer. The company’s R&D budget is about $7 billion.\n\nPfizer\nPfizer is one of the world's largest consumer healthcare and pharmaceutical companies, having acquired Warner-Lambert in the year 2000. The company has three business segments: human health, animal health and consumer healthcare. The consumer business includes many of the world's best-known brands, among them Halls, Tetra, Benadryl, Sudafed, Listerine, Desitin, Schick, Visine, Bengay, Lubriderm and Zantac.\n\nMerck & Co.\nAnother leading company is Merck, a global, research-driven pharmaceutical company working toward the discovery, development, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of human and animal health products – directly and through its joint ventures. One recent partnership was initiated with another drug giant, Sanofi-Aventis SA, to become the world's largest seller of animal medications. Merck also provides group prescription drug benefit services through Merck-Medco Managed Care LLC (Merck-Medco).

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature that I find particularly interesting is the Japanese **Kappa**. The Kappa is a mythical being from Japanese folklore, often described as a river imp or water sprite. It is said to inhabit ponds and rivers across Japan. The appearance of a Kappa is quite distinctive: it is typically depicted as a child-sized creature with scaly, reptilian skin that is green or yellow-green in color. Its most unique feature is the water-filled dish on top of its head, which is believed to be the source of its power.\n\nKappas are known for their mischievous and sometimes malevolent behavior, often blamed for drowning livestock and people. However, they are also said to be intelligent, and they are curious about human society. One of the ways to protect oneself from a Kappa is to bow deeply; being polite creatures, they would feel compelled to return the bow, causing the water to spill from their head and rendering them powerless.\n\nInterestingly, Kappas are also reputed to have a love for cucumbers, which can be used to appease them. It is a common practice in some regions to throw cucumbers into the water with the names of family members inscribed on them to keep the Kappa away.\n\nDespite their potential for harm, Kappas are sometimes depicted as friendly and helpful, especially if treated kindly by humans. They are known to have great knowledge of medicine, and there are stories of Kappas teaching these secrets to humans in gratitude for their kindness. The Kappa remains a popular figure in Japanese culture, appearing in literature, art, and even modern media, symbolizing the complex relationship between humans and the natural world.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Persuade your design team to choose one of the designs for next year’s rollout. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: When comparing a green car, typically referring to an electric vehicle (EV) or hybrid, with a traditional gasoline-powered car, several factors come into play. Green cars are generally more environmentally friendly, producing zero emissions in the case of EVs or reduced emissions for hybrids. They often have lower operating costs due to cheaper electricity compared to gasoline and fewer moving parts, resulting in less maintenance. However, the initial purchase price can be higher, and charging infrastructure, while improving, may not yet be as convenient as gasoline refueling.\n\nGasoline cars usually have lower upfront costs and longer ranges without refueling, making them more convenient for long trips. However, they contribute significantly to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and are subject to fluctuating fuel prices.\n\nIn conclusion, a green car is often the better choice for those prioritizing environmental impact, operational cost savings, and embracing future technology. The benefits of reduced emissions and lower fuel costs can outweigh the higher initial investment and charging considerations, aligning with global trends towards sustainability and energy independence.", "task_id": "64058d7e-9b06-4ed8-9b01-5b7efb9fb3ef", "level_title": "Automotive", "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement “NAFTA” is a significant trade pact involving the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It came into effect in January 1994 after years of negotiation, aiming to reduce or eliminate customs duties among the member states. This impacted in trade relations across North America, especially in the agricultural sector. For example, it has facilitated the flow of Mexican fruits and vegetables into the United States, providing consumers with a bigger variety of fruits and veggies.\nNAFTA's implementation has sparked mixed reactions due to its diverse impacts on the member countries. Proponents highlight the agreement's role in increasing efficiency, lowering consumer prices, and expanding markets, which have contributed to economic growth and strengthened trade ties. However, critics point to job losses in certain sectors and environmental concerns as areas of contention.\nAll in all, despite the debates, most folks agree that NAFTA has been a good thing. It's helped the U.S., Canada, and Mexico work together more closely and boosted their economies by making trade easier.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find focused free writing and questioning to be the most useful. Focused free writing allows me to explore a topic in depth without worrying about structure or grammar, which helps me uncover ideas I didn’t know I had. It’s especially helpful when I’m stuck or unsure how to begin a piece. By narrowing my attention to a specific subject, I can generate meaningful content while still maintaining the freedom to express myself creatively.\nQuestioning is another technique I rely on often. Asking questions like “Why does this matter?” or “What would happen if…?” helps me dig deeper into a topic and develop a stronger argument or narrative. It encourages critical thinking and helps me see different angles, which is essential for persuasive or reflective writing. While techniques like metaphor and symbolism add flair, I believe focused free writing and questioning are foundational tools that help shape the core of my ideas. They make the writing process more engaging and productive, especially during the early stages of brainstorming and drafting.\n", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Make it interesting and descriptive, and remember to check for pronoun reference. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Art is a universal language that transcends time, culture, and boundaries. It is an expression of the human experience, capturing emotions, ideas, and perspectives through various mediums such as painting, sculpture, music, dance, literature, and digital forms. From the earliest cave paintings to modern abstract expressions, art has served as a mirror reflecting society's values, struggles, and triumphs.\n\nOne of the most profound aspects of art is its ability to evoke deep emotions. A single painting can bring a sense of tranquility, a feeling of nostalgia, or ignite a powerful rush of anger. Art is often personal, yet it can create a shared connection between creator and observer. The choice of colors, shapes, and textures can all convey messages without uttering a single word.\n\nArt challenges perceptions. A seemingly simple sculpture, such as Michelangelo's \"David,\" reveals the intricate details of human anatomy, while modern art, like the works of Jackson Pollock or Andy Warhol, may challenge the very definition of what constitutes \"art.\" In every era, artists push boundaries and invite the viewer to look at the world from a different perspective.\n\nMoreover, art is an essential form of communication, especially in times of political or social unrest. During the Renaissance, artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael used their craft to communicate ideas about humanism, religion, and the nature of existence. In the 20th century, artists like Pablo Picasso used cubism to express the chaos and fragmentation of the world in the aftermath of war.", "task_id": "52a760cd-9898-4cce-bb43-c490923b2b45", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 0}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find metaphor and free writing to be particularly useful. Metaphors are powerful tools that allow writers to convey complex ideas and emotions through vivid and relatable imagery. By comparing one thing to another, metaphors can make abstract concepts more tangible and engaging for readers. For instance, describing a challenging situation as \"an uphill battle\" immediately evokes a sense of struggle and perseverance.\n\nOn the other hand, free writing is an excellent technique for overcoming writer's block and generating creative ideas. By writing continuously without worrying about grammar or structure, free writing encourages the flow of thoughts and helps uncover hidden insights. This technique is especially useful during the brainstorming phase, as it allows writers to explore different angles and perspectives without self-censorship.\n\nCombining these techniques can enhance the writing process, making it both more expressive and productive. Metaphors add depth and richness to the content, while free writing fosters creativity and spontaneity. Together, they provide a balanced approach to crafting compelling and imaginative pieces.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The concept of celebrity, especially in today's digital age, often promotes a shallow and distorted view of success and value. Many celebrities, propelled to fame through social media or reality television, often contribute little of substantial cultural or intellectual value, yet they wield disproportionate influence over public opinion and trends. This phenomenon perpetuates a culture that values appearance and charisma over talent and substance. For instance, the Kardashians have built an empire largely based on personal branding and media manipulation, rather than significant artistic or intellectual contributions. This focus on superficiality can skew societal priorities, leading young people to aspire to fame rather than meaningful achievements.\n\nFurthermore, the celebrity culture can be detrimental to the celebrities themselves, subjecting them to relentless public scrutiny and unrealistic expectations. This often results in a cycle of personal issues being played out in the public eye, which is both dehumanizing for the celebrities and unhealthy for the audience who consume these narratives. Ultimately, the glorification of celebrity status diminishes the appreciation for genuine talent and hard-earned success, while fostering a culture of envy and superficiality.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

My name is Tania, and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to introduce you to our company. Today, I will share with you the story of Frisko Shipping, our achievements, and what we expect from our new recruits.\n\nLet me start by giving you a brief history of our company. Frisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko. From humble beginnings, we have grown to have locations in 20 cities all over the world and employ more than 5,000 dedicated individuals. Last year, we achieved a profit of 5 million dollars and captured 10 percent of the global market. These milestones are a testament to our commitment to excellence and innovation.\n\nNow, I would like to share an interesting anecdote about our founder, Bill Frisko. Many of you might not know this, but Bill's inspiration to start Frisko Shipping came from a life-changing experience. One day, while sailing, Bill fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. Fortunately, a passing ship saved his life. This event sparked the idea of starting his own shipping company, driven by the belief that inspiration can be found in the most unexpected places.\n\nAs new members of the Frisko Shipping family, we expect you to bring motivation and enthusiasm to your roles. To make this session interactive, we will hold a quiz to see how much you already know about the company. Remember, your journey here is just beginning, and we are excited to see the unique contributions each of you will make.\n\nThank you for your attention, and let's make this an incredible journey together!", "task_id": "5c89b5ef-f9e4-44c0-bd77-31ed1d856ff0", "level_title": "Presentations", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: While celebrities often inspire and entertain, the relentless amplification of their lives through modern media, particularly social platforms, warrants critical examination. The very nature of celebrity culture fosters an often-unhealthy obsession with materialistic values and unattainable ideals of beauty and success. This constant exposure cultivates unrealistic expectations among fans, potentially leading to decreased self-esteem and body image issues as individuals compare their realities to a meticulously curated public persona. \n\nFurthermore, the pressure to maintain an immaculate public image and constant relevance can be incredibly detrimental to a celebrity's mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, and isolation despite being constantly surrounded by others. The relentless scrutiny, invasion of privacy by paparazzi, and the pervasive culture of cyberbullying and \"cancel culture\" create a high-stakes environment where every misstep is amplified and dissected, leaving little room for genuine human error or private struggle. \n\nThe focus on superficiality, wealth, and manufactured drama overshadows genuine achievement and potentially distracts society from more important issues. Celebrity culture requires a critical approach, recognizing its manipulative aspects. Promoting media literacy can help people understand the often-distorted narratives, thus fostering a more balanced perspective on fame and its true cost.\n ", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), established in January 1994, brought together the United States, Canada, and Mexico in a landmark trade partnership. Aimed at reducing or eliminating customs duties, the agreement significantly boosted trade relations, particularly in agriculture. For instance, it enabled the freer flow of Mexican fruits and vegetables into the U.S. market. NAFTA also promoted economic integration and enhanced market access for exporters, creating new opportunities for businesses across the region. However, it has faced criticism for contributing to job losses in some industries and challenges for small-scale farmers. Despite these drawbacks, NAFTA has had a profound impact on the economies of its member nations, increasing trade volumes and fostering stronger economic ties. Overall, it is regarded as a framework that has broadly benefited the United States, Canada, and Mexico, laying the groundwork for continued cooperation in the region.\nDespite mixed opinions, NAFTA has broadly benefited all three member nations by boosting trade and economic growth.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

The opportunity was to race in the F1 again with a team mate who was young and talented but rather inexperienced, which would present a great learning opportunity for the young team mate as well as a re-entry into F1 for the protagonist.

Later, Jake found a strange coin on the table—engraved with symbols and the year \"2147.\" Experts he showed it to couldn’t identify the metal. \n\nWas it an elaborate hoax, or did Jake actually meet a time traveler?

In the past, traditional media such as newspapers, magazines, and television played a central role in how people consumed information. I remember watching the evening news with my family and reading printed newspapers to stay updated on current events. Now, however, I rely mostly on digital media—especially news apps, social media platforms, and online articles. This shift has not only changed the format of media but also transformed my reading habits. Instead of reading long-form articles or full newspapers, I now tend to scan headlines, summaries, and quick posts; this allows me to absorb a large amount of information in a short period of time. As a result, my attention span has shortened, and I find it harder to concentrate on lengthy content. On the other hand, I can now personalize the kind of news I see—choosing topics and sources that interest me most. In short: media has become more convenient, immediate, and interactive; however, it has also made deep, focused reading more difficult.", "task_id": "7e0827d0-955c-484a-8c4f-81fe6a574af8", "level_title": "11-Upper Intermediate", "label": 5}

For your questions about employees motivations, I would like to share my thoughts. Here are three ideas that I learnt from my experiences as a manager.\n1. Act as a mentor: your team members are not fully skillful. They are on the way of learning. You can recommend them some trainings based on their interests and goals for career. \n2. Listening is the Key: Try to take more time for communication. Listen what they think and feel in the everyday work. They will open up their heart to you if you are next to them with respect.\n3. Give them work-life balance: Employees are always more productive after vacation. For the powerful team work, you are responsible to support for vacation leave for the each team member.\n\nAlso, here are 2 ideas for NOT to do:\n 1. Do not be bossy: never forget to respect each other. You have to be better human before being a manager.\n2. Do not treat unfairly: our employees are smart enough to realize if a manager is not  fair.\n\nPlease reach me any time again. thanks.", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 3}

It was an old, mysterious mansion-themed room that promised to test our wits and teamwork. To be honest, we were a little nervous; we’d never done anything this intense before.\n\nWe entered the room, and immediately, the atmosphere was eerie, with vintage furniture, hidden compartments, and locked drawers. As we started to solve puzzles, we quickly realized how intricate everything was. There were cryptic clues hidden in paintings, secret codes embedded in books, and even a puzzle involving a dusty old grandfather clock.\n\nMark, with his knack for logic and puzzles, was absolutely on fire. He cracked codes in record time and guided us through the more complex riddles. With only five minutes left on the clock, we managed to unlock the final door—victorious!\n\nIt was such an exhilarating experience, and the best part was how we worked together under pressure.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.\n", "task_id": "bb0d114c-9550-4f27-9138-b2eb14c39437", "level_title": "Law", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Case Report: Tort Action for Trespassing\n\nPlaintiff: The plaintiff, Medina, broke into the Byron family’s home, causing significant distress and terror to the family. While it was unclear whether Medina took any valuable items, the family was clearly disturbed by the intrusion.\n\nDefendant: Medina claimed that he mistakenly thought the house was empty. Fearing for his safety, he sought shelter in the house and ended up ransacking it, believing it to be unoccupied.\n\nVerdict: Medina was found guilty of trespassing, which is a criminal offense. The court imposed a fine of $1,000, to be paid in two installments—one immediately and the other at a later date. Additionally, Medina was sentenced to 300 hours of community service as part of his punishment.\n\nCommentary: The verdict appears appropriate given the circumstances. While Medina did not intend to cause harm, his actions of breaking and entering and disturbing the household could not be overlooked. The fine and community service serve as reasonable consequences for his unlawful actions, balancing the need for accountability with his claimed lack of intent. However, the unclear issue of stolen valuables could warrant further investigation.", "task_id": "bb0d114c-9550-4f27-9138-b2eb14c39437", "level_title": "Law", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: When I go into a bank I get rattled. The clerks rattle me; the wickets rattle me; the sight of the money rattles me; everything rattles me.\n\nThe moment I cross the threshold of a bank and attempt to transact business there, I become an irresponsible idiot.\n\nI knew this beforehand, but my salary had been raised to fifty dollars a month and I felt that the bank was the only place for it.\n\nSo I shambled in and looked timidly round at the clerks. I had an idea that a person about to open an account must needs consult the manager.\n\nI went up to a wicket marked \"Accountant.\" The accountant was a tall, cool devil. The very sight of him rattled me.

I held my fifty-six dollars clutched in a crumpled ball in my pocket.\n\n\"Are you the manager?\" I said. God knows I didn't doubt it.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"Can I see you,\" I asked, \"alone?\" I didn't want to say \"alone\" again, but without it the thing seemed self-evident.\n\nThe manager looked at me in some alarm. He felt that I had an awful secret to reveal.\n\n\"Come in here,\" he said, and led the way to a private room. He turned the key in the lock.\n\n\"We are safe from interruption here,\" he said; \"sit down.\"\n\nWe both sat down and looked at each other. I found no voice to speak.\n\n\"You are one of Pinkerton's men, I presume,\" he said.\n\nHe had gathered from my mysterious manner that I was a detective. I knew what he was thinking, and it made me worse.\n\n\"No, not from Pinkerton's,\" I said, seeming to imply that I came from a rival agency. \"To tell the truth,\" I went on, as if I had been prompted to lie about it, \"I am not a detective at all. I have come to open an account. I intend to keep all my money in this bank.\"\n\nThe manager looked relieved but still serious; he concluded now that I was a son of Baron Rothschild or a young Gould.\n\n\"A large account, I suppose,\" he said.\n\n\"Fairly large,\" I whispered. \"I propose to deposit fifty-six dollars now and fifty dollars a month regularly.\"\n\nThe manager got up and opened the door.

The free-trade zone in other words is to eliminate all tariff and non-tariff barriers amongst the above mentioned countries. The agreement aimed to reduce trading costs and make North America a competitive trading bloc in the global market place. \nThe agreement was made with a holy purpose, as it brought cheap goods to consumers and generated great wealth for investors and the financial sector, but it also increased income inequality, weakened labor unions and accelerated the hollowing out of America's industrial base.\nThe NAFTA agreement failed to protect workers' health and safety due to the weaknesses of the side agreement, which were not foreseen.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 4}

These parts keep the airplane stable and help control its direction. The vertical stabilizer helps the airplane turn left or right, while the horizontal stabilizer controls the up and down movement.\nFinally, the engines provide the power needed for the airplane to move forward.

Take a few minutes each day to focus on your breathing, clear your mind, and center yourself—this helps reduce stress and enhances clarity.\nPlanning ahead is another useful technique. Organize your tasks and prioritize them. Break larger goals into smaller, manageable steps to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Keeping a to-do list or using productivity apps can be beneficial.\nWhen tensions rise, physical activity works wonders.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, came into force in January 1994, after years of negotiation between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Its primary goal was to reduce or eliminate customs duties among the three member states, promoting free trade and increasing economic cooperation. By removing trade barriers, NAFTA created a more integrated and competitive economy across North America. \n\nOne of the most noticeable effects of NAFTA has been on trade relations, especially in the agricultural sector. For instance, Mexican fruits and vegetables have flooded the US market, benefiting consumers with lower prices and greater variety. Similarly, Canadian and Mexican businesses have gained better access to the US market, boosting their exports and contributing to job creation in all three countries. \n\nHowever, NAFTA has had both positive and negative impacts. While it has spurred growth, it has also led to job losses in certain sectors, especially in industries facing competition from lower-wage countries. Despite these challenges, overall, NAFTA has benefited all three member nations, fostering economic growth and stronger ties among the US, Canada, and Mexico.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: What makes a successful leader is hard to define. Take me, for example. Most of my adult life I was more of a follower than a leader. I've always had a hard time persuading others, and I lack most of the characteristics that we associate with a strong leader, like charisma and drive. It wasn't until five years ago, when I was hired by a new company and ended up in a management training course, that things began to change for me. At first, I thought I would never be able to develop leadership qualities. Among the biggest challenges for me was just feeling comfortable in front of a large group. But the leader of the course earned my trust and, before I knew it, I was being asked to help others. Now I'm the manager of my department, and my boss is very happy with my performance. I don't think I'm the best leader in the world, but my staff respects me and I feel confident.

Many years ago, Bill fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. Miraculously, a passing ship saved him. That moment sparked the idea to create Frisko Shipping, a company driven by resilience, passion, and innovation.\n\nAs new recruits, you’re expected to bring that same energy and enthusiasm to our team. We want you to think creatively, solve problems, and make a real impact.\n\nTo wrap up, I’d like you to think about your own journey with Frisko Shipping. How will you contribute to our growth?

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language students encounter a variety of challenges that can impede their learning process. One primary issue is the complexity of grasping new grammar rules, which often differ significantly from their native language structures. This complexity can lead to confusion and frustration, especially when the rules are irregular or have numerous exceptions. Additionally, pronunciation poses a significant hurdle, as students may struggle with sounds that do not exist in their mother tongue, leading to misunderstandings or lack of confidence in speaking. Vocabulary acquisition is another challenge; students must not only learn new words but also understand contextual nuances and colloquial uses. Cultural differences further complicate language learning, as students may find it difficult to understand idiomatic expressions or cultural references that are deeply embedded in the language. Moreover, language learners often face a lack of immersive environments, which are crucial for practical application and fluency. This is compounded by the fear of making mistakes, which can hinder practice and progress. Balancing these challenges while maintaining motivation and consistency is essential for language students to succeed.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most fascinating legendary creatures in India is the Naga, a serpent deity that appears in Hindu and Buddhist mythology. Nagas are often depicted as half-human, half-snake beings, possessing the ability to transform between their human and serpent forms. They are believed to reside in the underworld, known as Patala, and are guardians of treasures and water bodies.\n\nNagas are revered for their wisdom and power, and they play a significant role in various myths and legends. In Hinduism, they are associated with Lord Vishnu, who rests on the serpent Ananta, and Lord Shiva, who wears a cobra around his neck. In Buddhism, Nagas are considered protectors of the Buddha and his teachings.\n\nThese creatures are not only feared for their potential to bring destruction through natural disasters like floods and droughts but are also respected for their benevolence in providing rain and fertility. Temples and shrines dedicated to Nagas can be found throughout India, where devotees offer prayers and rituals to seek their blessings and protection.\n\nThe Naga symbolizes the duality of nature, embodying both creation and destruction, and continues to be a powerful figure in Indian folklore and religious practices.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a complex and evolving issue, and it’s important to consider both sides of the debate. I firmly believe that companies do have a responsibility to society, not just their shareholders. While it’s true that businesses exist to generate profit, they cannot do so in isolation. Companies rely on communities for labor, resources, and customers. In this sense, the argument for CSR, as highlighted by lil@213, is compelling: it’s a two-way street. When businesses contribute positively to the communities they operate in, they not only help the public but also create an environment where they can continue to thrive.\n\nFurthermore, as Jack@MSU notes, CSR makes good business sense. In today's world, consumers are increasingly driven by values, not just product quality. Companies with a strong CSR track record build consumer trust, leading to higher loyalty and long-term profitability. This shift in consumer behavior makes CSR an investment in the company’s future.\n\nOn the other hand, some critics, like theG8T and JackD_92, argue that the primary role of business is to maximize shareholder value, and CSR can often serve as a marketing tool rather than a genuine effort to drive change. While there is some truth in this view, it doesn’t diminish the growing pressure on companies to contribute positively to the world.\n\nIn conclusion, CSR isn’t just a “nice-to-have” anymore—it’s essential for businesses to remain relevant, ethical, and sustainable in a world that increasingly values social responsibility.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

The city is bustling 24/7, and there's always something to do, whether it's exploring Broadway shows, visiting museums, or simply walking through the busy streets. The energy of the city is contagious, and people often rely on public transportation to get around due to the city's compact nature.\n\nIn contrast, Los Angeles presents a more laid-back atmosphere. While it is a major urban hub, its sprawling layout and car-centric culture create a more relaxed vibe compared to New York. The city is famous for its entertainment industry, with Hollywood being the heart of the film and television world. The sunny weather and proximity to beautiful beaches also make Los Angeles a more outdoor-oriented city, with residents enjoying activities like hiking, surfing, or relaxing by the ocean.\n\nWhile New York thrives on its density and constant activity, Los Angeles shines with its open spaces and focus on leisure.

This report summarizes the available data and offers an initial overview of the potential oil and gas resources.\n\nFindings\nPetroleum has been identified in Carlos Fields, but further testing is required to evaluate accumulations across various geological formations. Surveys suggest the field contains significant oil and gas resources, with key elements like source rocks, reservoirs, and trapping mechanisms in place.\n\nConclusion\nThe initial estimate for recoverable oil in Carlos Fields is approximately 21 million barrels. This figure is based on limited data and may increase with enhanced recovery techniques and further exploration.\n\nRecommendations\nWe recommend acquiring new seismic data, compiling and analyzing existing information, creating detailed structural maps, modeling source rock parameters, and calculating petroleum volumetrics to better assess the field’s potential.

Drug-related violence can lead to loss of lives, community disruption, and a general increase in crime rates, impacting the safety and stability of societies.\n\nEconomic Impact: The drug trade destabilizes economies by diverting resources from productive sectors. It increases law enforcement and healthcare costs, hampers development, and can lead to money laundering, which further undermines financial systems.\n\nThese points will help highlight the severe consequences of the illegal drug trade in your presentation.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: o speak another language, knowing what to call things -- especially things you can't just see and point to -- is the essential first step toward fluency. However, vocabulary is often spotty in classroom learning, which tends to focus on memorizing lists of words in the target language and their definitions in English.\n\nThe traditional academic approach leads to the common frustration of knowing how to talk about the constitution in French but not knowing how to say useful things like cupboard or butter knife.\n\nThere are a few ways to improve vocabulary, all of which include learning in context. When I studied Chinese, for example, I had a five-subject notebook and dedicated one of each section to a topic, depending on my level and interests, i.e., food, household items, politics, finance, and music.\n\nI would then spend a few weeks learning words related to these five main subjects and categorizing them separately. When I reviewed vocabulary, I'd review them by topic. I would also build lists of synonyms, so whenever I defined a word, I'd list a few other synonyms in the target language so my vocabulary would become more sophisticated and diverse.\n\nThere's also the old trick of building vocabulary in a physical space, like putting up note cards all over your kitchen and bathroom to label things in the target language. Defining words in the target language instead of English is another excellent tactic that helps you rack your brain for words you already know to describe the new word.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Nowdays, digital media is a mass way of entertaiment: reading news and books, watching films, publicity, etc. In my opinion this has bring two point of view: more accesibilty to information and more opportunities for writters; in the other hand, more fake information appears online. There is so much information that our brain is not able to asume and its more easy to change the information that is provided on digital media so its cheaper than the print information. In this case one´s is printed, is more difficult and expensive to change it . So for me, I like to read paper books, love the smell of them ; dont like the harm to my eyes of the scrrens.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: CSR is a topic that sparks diverse opinions. On one hand, proponents argue that companies have a duty to contribute positively to society. On the other hand, critics believe that a company’s primary responsibility is to its shareholders. Here’s my take on the debate:\n\nFor CSR: Companies do not operate in a vacuum; they are integral parts of the communities in which they function. By engaging in CSR, businesses can foster goodwill and build stronger relationships with their stakeholders. For instance, sustainable practices and fair employee benefits not only secure future possibilities but also enhance productivity and reduce turnover.\n\nAgainst CSR: Critics like theG8T argue that the primary responsibility of a business is to increase its profits, as Milton Friedman famously stated. They believe that CSR initiatives can be seen as a distraction from this goal. Additionally, some argue that CSR efforts are often minimal compared to a company’s total earnings and can be viewed as a marketing strategy rather than a genuine commitment to social good.\n\nConclusion: While the debate continues, it is clear that CSR can offer significant benefits to both companies and society. By balancing profit-making with social responsibility, businesses can achieve sustainable growth and contribute to the well-being of their communities.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing various skills and strategies.

Effective language learning also benefits from consistent practice, exposure to authentic materials, and a willingness to embrace mistakes as part of the learning process. \nHere's a more detailed look at effective language learning:\n1. Building a Solid Foundation:\nVocabulary: Start by memorizing common words and phrases to build a basic foundation. \nGrammar: Understand the basic rules of the language, including verb conjugations, sentence structure, and tenses. \nPronunciation: Practice the sounds of the language and pay attention to intonation and rhythm. \n2.

Everyone goes through challenging times, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed at times. The key is to find healthy ways to cope with your stress and to reach out for support when you need it. \n\nOne thing that can be helpful in dealing with stress is to identify the sources of your stress and to try to address them. Sometimes, simply talking about your problems with a friend or a therapist can help you gain perspective and come up with solutions. Don't be afraid to reach out for help when you need it. \n\nAnother important aspect of dealing with stress is taking care of yourself. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and getting regular exercise. It may sound simple, but taking care of your physical health can have a big impact on your mental well-being. \n\nLastly, try to find ways to relax and unwind. Whether it's through meditation, yoga, or simply taking a walk outside, finding time for yourself to decompress can do wonders for your stress levels.

A fully matured Kitsune can have up to nine tails, each tail signifying increasing wisdom and power.\n\nKitsune are known for their cunning and trickery, often playing pranks on humans, yet they can also be benevolent protectors. They are said to possess the ability to generate fire or lightning, enter dreams, and even create illusions so convincing that they can alter reality. Despite their mischievous nature, Kitsune are highly respected and often associated with prosperity and good fortune. Stories of Kitsune have permeated Japanese culture, appearing in countless myths, legends, and modern media, reflecting their enduring appeal and the complex blend of fear, respect, and fascination they inspire.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Robots are becoming increasingly common in various industries across my country, revolutionizing the way tasks are performed. In manufacturing, robots assemble products with precision and efficiency, reducing costs and increasing production speed. In healthcare, robotic-assisted surgeries allow for greater accuracy, while robotic exoskeletons help patients regain mobility. Service robots are also used in restaurants, hotels, and even customer service roles. While I find this technological advancement fascinating, I also have mixed feelings about the rapid integration of robots. On the positive side, robots improve productivity, enhance safety by handling dangerous tasks, and provide assistance in areas like elderly care. However, there are concerns about job displacement, as automation may replace human workers in certain industries. Additionally, over-reliance on robots could lead to a loss of critical skills and reduced human interaction. Society must find a balance embracing robotics for their benefits while ensuring that people are not left behind. Education and job retraining programs can help workers adapt to this evolving landscape.", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

It requires not only a strong academic foundation but also a deep commitment to helping others and making a positive impact on society.\nBecoming a doctor is a long and challenging journey. It starts with years of rigorous education, including undergraduate studies, medical school, and often, residency training. During this time, aspiring doctors gain knowledge in various fields of science, anatomy, and patient care, while also developing essential interpersonal skills to communicate effectively with patients.\nDoctors must be prepared to face difficult situations, such as delivering bad news or managing life-threatening emergencies. Their ability to remain calm under pressure and provide emotional support to patients and families is crucial.\nWorking in a clinic or hospital can be both rewarding and challenging. The environment is typically fast-paced, requiring medical professionals to manage multiple tasks at once while providing high-quality care to patients. \nFurthermore, the medical field is constantly evolving, with new advancements in technology, treatment methods, and research. As a result, medical professionals must be lifelong learners, staying up-to-date with the latest developments to provide the best possible care.\nDoctor remuneration varies significantly depending on factors such as specialty, location, years of experience, and the healthcare system in which they work. However, it is generally one of the higher-paying professions, reflecting the years of education, training, and the demanding nature of the work.\nIn conclusion, a career in medicine is not only intellectually challenging but also deeply fulfilling. It allows individuals to make a tangible difference in the lives of others while continuously growing in knowledge and expertise. For those with a passion for science and a desire to help others, it remains one of the most respected and essential fields in society.", "task_id": "ae90d852-9ab7-47ca-a8f8-4a90eaec83f4", "level_title": "Medical industry", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: \nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is a business approach that seeks to integrate social and environmental concerns into a company’s operations. In a world where consumers and communities demand more transparency and ethics, CSR has become an essential component for the sustainable success of organizations. \n\nIt is true that implementing CSR policies can pose significant challenges for companies. Initial costs can be high, and adapting business practices to meet ethical and environmental standards can require time and resources. Furthermore, some critics suggest that CSR may be used as a marketing strategy rather than a genuine commitment to social change. \n\nHowever, the long-term benefits of CSR far outweigh these challenges. Companies that adopt responsible practices not only enhance their reputations but also foster customer loyalty and attract talented employees who seek to work for organizations with values aligned with their own. In addition, CSR can lead to innovations that improve operational efficiency and reduce costs in the long run. Responsible companies are also better positioned to anticipate and adapt to future regulations, giving them a competitive advantage. \n\nIn summary, although implementing corporate social responsibility may present initial challenges, its benefits are undeniable. CSR not only improves corporate image, but also contributes to the well-being of society and the environment, ensuring a more sustainable future for all. Companies that integrate CSR into their core strategy are better prepared to meet the challenges of today’s global marketplace.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: \nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a vital aspect of modern business that goes beyond mere compliance with legal requirements. It represents a commitment to ethical practices, sustainability, and a positive impact on society. In my opinion, CSR is essential for fostering trust and building a strong reputation among stakeholders, including customers, employees, and investors.\n\nCSR initiatives can lead to long-term benefits for companies by enhancing brand loyalty and differentiating them from competitors. Consumers are increasingly mindful of the social and environmental implications of their purchases, and companies that actively engage in CSR can appeal to this growing demographic. Moreover, CSR can improve employee morale and retention, as workers often prefer to be associated with organizations that align with their personal values.\n\nHowever, CSR should not be seen merely as a marketing tool or a box-ticking exercise. Authenticity is crucial; companies must genuinely integrate CSR into their business strategies and operations. Effective CSR requires transparency, accountability, and a willingness to address complex global challenges.\n\nUltimately, CSR is not just about philanthropy; it is about creating a sustainable business model that contributes to the greater good while ensuring long-term profitability. When done right, it reflects a company’s commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen and can lead to meaningful change in society.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

As he was following one of his usual trails, he saw a path he hadn't seen before, covered by overgrown bushes. Very intrigued, Miguel decided to explore the new route.\nThe path led to a small clearing where Miguel found an old, weathered bench. It looked like it hadn't been used in years, but it offered a perfect spot to sit and enjoy the surroundings. While resting there, Miguel  noticed a bird's nest in the branches above, filled with chirping baby birds. He watched them for a while, fascinated by the miracle of nature.\nAfter the little break, Miguel continued down the trail, which eventually looped back to a part of the forest he recognized. On his way back, he chatted with a fellow hiker who mentioned that the bench was part of a forgotten birdwatching spot that locals used to visit years ago.\nAlex returned home with a renewed appreciation for the small surprises nature can offer. His unexpected discovery reminded him that sometimes taking a different path can lead to unexpected experiences.", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Blame is to hold someone accountable for something wrong whether it's their fault or not. Complaint is the expression of dissatisfaction with someone or something. Most psychologists agree that criticism does not lead people to change behavior. Instead it creates anger and defensiveness on the part of the person criticized. Communication between the parties is shackled, and positive relationships impeded. Yet, we are left with a paradox. Criticism is the action of expressing disapproval of something or someone. A criticism is a statement that expresses disapproval. I am sure no one likes to be criticised but at the same time if we dont we will never improve ourselves. \n\nThanks for reading ", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 1}

This production and sale hurt legitimate businesses by reducing their profits and leading to job losses. In addition, governments lose tax revenue, affecting public services. And counterfeit on health products can affect directly to public health since poor quality materials and ingredients can cause serious harm situations, or even fatalities. \nSigns of a Fake\nDetecting counterfeit products can be difficult, but there are signs to watch. For example, low prices that seem too good to be true, poor quality packaging, inconsistent, and incorrect branding. Always ask for proof of authenticity or see a trading license from street traders, and examine all purchases very carefully before leaving the mall or the market. Also, you can ask the markets traders why their prices are so cheap for desirable brand clothes. \nAlso, good practices can avoid buying fake goods. For this reason, don´t ever buy anything from the stands outside the mall. Buy you goods from reputable stores. \nWhat to do if you discover fake goods \nIf you suspect that you´ve encountered counterfeit products, it´s important to take action.

Write the **strategic summary** and **risk assessment** sections of the proposal using the notes. Write 140–200 words. [SEP] Response: Strategic Summary\n\nZen is a unique $4 million boutique hotel concept that combines luxury accommodation with a full-service spa, health, and fitness center. Market research from AccomData Group highlights growing consumer interest in weekend getaways centered around wellness and relaxation, as well as increased demand for health-focused lifestyle choices. Zen addresses a current gap in the market—unsatisfying cuisine in most fitness centers—by offering a curated healthy menu crafted by top chefs from renowned restaurants. Guests will also benefit from fully equipped gyms, swimming pools, and professional fitness instructors. Construction is projected to take two years, with returns expected in the second year post-opening. Projected profits are estimated at $1 million annually after year two, with the initial investment fully recouped within four years of opening and steady profits beginning in year five.\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nEconomic downturn scenarios have been fully accounted for in all financial projections. Should the economy remain stable or improve, the timeline for investment recovery and profitability could be reduced by up to 50%. Additionally, a comprehensive media campaign managed by the award-winning Kudos Advertising Agency will maximize visibility and market entry impact, further mitigating risk and accelerating potential returns.\n", "task_id": "0efc8863-e086-4c4a-aa14-7f688dec4cb3", "level_title": "Correspondence", "label": 5}

Use the notes to help you. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: We used advanced PC simulation to verify how Sun Valley Dam construction and completion will impact on overall sloth livelihood. We ran the simulation repeatedly in order to verify possible environmental effects of variables like: area of habitat, food variety, etc. As a result, we found that the main factors caused by the construction of the dam will be: loss of habitat and reduction of food variety. We concluded that these elements will lead to sloth population reduction. Therefore we recommend to relocate local sloth species to neighboring Corona Valley, prior to the dam construction. We believe that such action can prevent ecological cataclysm and perhaps even extinction of sloth species living in Sun Valley.

Alcina refugiou-se debaixo do toldo de uma velha loja de ferragens, fechada havia muitos anos. A noite não estava convidativa mas havia sempre quem estivesse disposto a comprar felicidade falsa e prazer duvidoso.\n\nTal como o antigo patrão que a iniciara naquela vida… Uma vida perdida ou talvez não. Doutra forma estaria, aos 36 anos, rodeada de um rancho de filhos que tinha de sustentar, um marido bêbado para aturar, o gado para tratar e as terras para amanhar.\n\nParou um carro. Saiu da cobertura, aproximou-se da janela que desceu lentamente. Entre sorrisos, disparou um costumado cumprimento:\n\n- Boa noite, sortudo…\n\n- Sortudo?\n\n- Sim! Vejo que queres companhia. E estou aqui para te ajudar…\n\nAs frases eram invariavelmente as mesmas, proferidas naquele tom meloso de provocação libidinosa. Afastou-se do carro um pouco para que a apreciasse. O condutor não gostou do que viu e sem nada dizer, arrancou.\n\nMais à frente duas jovens tiveram mais sorte e entraram na viatura.\n\nAlcina nem pestanejou. Já sabia que era assim. A sua idade trazia-lhe profundos sulcos na face, que nem as camadas de base conseguiam disfarçar.\n\nTodavia o corpo parecia menos mau, assim julgava. Vestia nessa noite uma minisaia curta que mais parecia um cinto. Um top cotado e meias de renda. Por cima, um casaco comprido de um vermelho berrante mas atractivo.\n\nRegressou ao toldo e sentou-se no degrau frio e molhado. Encostou a cabeça à parede e adormeceu. Nesse sono acabou por viajar ao seu passado, umas vezes fantástico, outras nem tanto. Parecia sentir ainda o cheiro do pão acabado de cozer e outrossim do corpo gordo e mal-cheiroso do velho que a possuíra pela primeira vez. Aquele sono levou-a de regresso à sua antiga escola, onde as letras e os números a animavam. E à mãe que desejava colocar a filha a estudar mas o pai, austero e avaro, só pretendia dinheiro.\n\nSentiu um toque muito ao de leve no ombro. Acordou sobressaltada e deu de caras com um jovem rapaz que a mirava. Perguntou:\n\n- Não achas que és muito novo para andares às meninas?\n\nO jovem voluntário olhou para os colegas ao lado e sorriu. Insistiu:\n\n- Posso ajudá-la nalguma coisa?\n\nAlcina percebendo finalmente o equívoco, respondeu:\n\n- Hum, só gostava de voltar a ser feliz!\n\nTags:400 palavrasescrita\n link do post comentar favorito\ninícioseguinte »\n5 comentários\n Anónimo  08.12.2014\nlink do comentário\nresponder\ndiscussão\nImagem de perfil\n José da Xã  08.12.2014\nObrigado Paulo.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: In my nation, the process of purchasing a property and submitting an application for a home loan can be both thrilling and difficult. Finding a house that suits your needs and budget is the first step. Rising property costs in recent years have made it more challenging for first-time buyers to enter the market, particularly in cities. Although property prices vary widely by region, housing has generally become more expensive with few possibilities for reasonably priced residences.\nAfter you've located a property, you must fill out a number of forms in order to apply for a house loan. A lot of paperwork, including proof of income, employment history, credit ratings, and other financial data, must be provided during this lengthy procedure. A down payment may also be required by lenders, which can be a major obstacle for some purchasers. For a normal house loan, interest rates are usually between 4 and 6%, though they might vary depending on the state of the economy.\n\nAlthough using a mortgage broker or real estate agent is not necessary, many consumers decide to do so in order to negotiate with lenders and handle the complicated paperwork. While a real estate agent can help you find the ideal property, a mortgage broker can help you get the finest loan conditions. Overall, even though purchasing a home might be a daunting process, it is feasible to obtain a home loan and buy a property with the right planning and expert help.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a mortgage in France, particularly in Paris, can be both complex and competitive. The process begins with obtaining a mortgage, which requires meeting strict lending conditions set by French banks.\nLenders will typically assess your financial stability, including your income, employment status and existing debts. A crucial factor is your debt-to-income ratio, which should not exceed 35% of your monthly income. This ratio includes future mortgage payments. Additionally, most banks require a minimum down payment of 10% of the property price, but higher contributions are often preferred, especially in the expensive Paris market.\nAnother key requirement is having a stable financial history, with minimal overdrafts or outstanding debts. For non-residents or self-employed individuals, banks may require additional guarantees, such as a higher down payment or additional collateral.\nInterest rates in France remain competitive, ranging from 3-4% for fixed-rate loans, but eligibility depends on your credit profile. A life insurance policy is usually mandatory, guaranteeing repayment in the event of unforeseen events.\nThe process also involves providing extensive documentation, including income statements, tax returns, and proof of savings. While dealing with the paperwork can be overwhelming, working with a mortgage broker often simplifies the process, as they negotiate the best terms on your behalf.\nIn Paris, high property prices and strict lending criteria mean that the dream of home ownership is achievable, but requires careful financial planning and perseverance.\n", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Do you believe companies have a responsibility to society? Or do you think a company's only responsibility is to its shareholders? We invite you to join this discussion by posting your opinion on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nFor CSR\n\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925bb", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo are two of the most prominent cities in Brazil, each with unique characteristics that make them distinct yet similar in certain aspects.\n\nRio de Janeiro, often called \"The Marvelous City,\" is famous for its breathtaking natural beauty, including iconic landmarks like Sugarloaf Mountain and Christ the Redeemer. Its beaches, such as Copacabana and Ipanema, attract tourists from around the world. The city is also known for its vibrant cultural events, especially the world-renowned Rio Carnival. Life in Rio tends to be more laid-back, reflecting the city’s focus on leisure and tourism.\n\nSão Paulo, on the other hand, is Brazil’s financial and economic hub. It is a bustling metropolis with a cosmopolitan atmosphere, offering a rich cultural scene, including museums, theaters, and diverse cuisine. Unlike Rio, São Paulo is more business-oriented, with a faster pace of life.\n\nDespite their differences, both cities share a passion for football, samba, and a rich Brazilian heritage. They are also key urban centers, contributing significantly to Brazil’s economy and culture.\n\nWhile Rio captivates with its natural beauty and relaxed vibe, São Paulo impresses with its modernity and cultural diversity, showcasing the varied essence of Brazil.", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home in India involves a series of steps, beginning with determining your budget and preferred location. Housing prices vary significantly across cities; for instance, in 2023, prices in Mumbai or Delhi are higher compared to cities like Pune or Bangalore. Typically, residential property prices in prime areas range from ₹10,000 to ₹30,000 per square foot, while suburban areas may offer more affordable options.\n\nOnce a property is chosen, applying for a home loan is a common step. The loan application process involves submitting documents such as identity proof, income proof, and property details. Banks assess eligibility based on credit score, income, and repayment capacity. Home loan interest rates in India fluctuate between 6.5% to 9%, influenced by economic conditions and RBI policies.\n\nReal estate brokers play a crucial role in navigating the property market. They provide expertise in finding suitable properties, negotiating prices, and handling paperwork. Brokers charge a commission, typically 1-2% of the property's sale price, which can vary depending on the region and the services offered.\n\nIn summary, buying a home in India requires careful planning, from understanding market prices to securing a home loan. Engaging with a broker can simplify the process, though it adds to the overall cost. Prospective buyers must consider current interest rates and market trends to make informed decisions.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}

Give an example to support your opinion, and end your post with an action step, suggestion or recommendation. Type in the input box. Write 50-90 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Current TV programs are all biased toward sponsors, governments, etc., and they are mind-controlling the public by not broadcasting the truth. Particularly problematic is NHK, a state-run broadcaster that collects subscription fees from the public, yet employs employees from other countries within its ranks to provide biased coverage. NHK also broadcasts information on territorial disputes in consideration of other countries, thereby eroding the people's ability to think and make decisions and making them complicit in the government's activities. It is doubtful that a state-run broadcaster, which is paid for by the public, can broadcast with consideration for other countries, or that a broadcaster that is also broadcasting in other countries but does not collect subscription fees and treats its citizens as slaves can exist. If they don't report the information that the people need, I hope they will reform now and stop taking subscription fees from the people.", "task_id": "6e8793e1-760b-43e0-a8a9-44dc11336782", "level_title": "7-Intermediate", "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a paragraph describing how robots are being used in your country. How do you feel about them? In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Some look to the stars to spot signs of life on other planets. Others look for signs of a different kind, to the omens and portents they hope will foretell of riches a-waiting, relationships a-coming and fame a-calling. Some look upward to the heavens for such signs; others, inward to visions and inspiration. And the rest of us may look downward at more humble and homely teacups, tarot cards and talismans to find what the future might hold in store.\n\nBy no means a 21st-century phenomenon, means of divining the future have long been part of traditional cultures around the world. People have scoured their dreams for symbols that might unlock what’s around the corner. Some societies have looked to Mother Nature for guidance, reading the entrails of animals or the shapes formed by clouds, shadows cast by stones or yarrow stalks, or scanned upturned palms and faces. These forms of divination have often been associated with people believed, or who believe themselves, to have special gifts of extrasensory perception, or second sight. The role of the priest or priestess, shaman or magician is still central in many societies today, though their responsibilities may now also include here-and-now concerns as well as forebodings.\n\nThroughout history, particular people have been associated with clairvoyant or clairaudient abilities. For the rationalists, these people are no more than charlatans who offer vague and cryptic messages, veiled in metaphor and imagery, open to variable interpretations. To those who feel there is more to this world than the physical eyes can show us, such messengers hold the key to unlocking the future trajectory of our world, and offer hope of averting dangers yet to come.\n\nOne such individual is Nostradamus. Controversy and criticism surround what is known of him. Born Michel de Nostredame in France in the early 16th century, he Latinized his name to Nostradamus for personal reasons. Often depicted as a physician, some historians claim he was thrown out of medical university. On one thing most would agree, however: Nostradamus was an astrologer, looking to the movement of the planets and people’s times of birth to draw up his prognostications. But he has perhaps gained most notoriety not for his glimpses into personal lives, but for his revelations about the future through quatrains, or verse-like commentary.\n\nAttributed to Nostradamus with the benefit of what naysayers call retrospective hindsight are prophesies of world wars, numerous famines and disasters, man’s landing on the moon and the recent collapse of world economies. For non-believers, however, these verses are no more than the ramblings of a man deluded, and the application of creative interpretation on the part of those who wish to believe in Nostradamus’ clairvoyance. Linguists argue his messages were wrapped in such obscurity and metaphorical language that the doors of perception were left wide open for the public to make of them what they would. They point to the wealth of phrases such as ‘and the young lion shall overcome the old’ as his means to figuratively (and some would say, therefore, evasively) refer to a wide spread of people and nations. But when the times get tough and bad things happen to good people, many look to Nostradamus’ writings, imagining they foretold this writing on the wall and heralded apocalyptic news.\n\nHow did Nostradamus make these predictions supposedly ranging from technological advances to world destruction? Reportedly, he stared into water or fire to see these visions, though more extreme believers claim the man was a time traveler! Perhaps there is only one thing we can be truly certain of, however: The debate about the meaning of Nostradamus’ work will continue for as long we have a future!", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: All companies have moral responsibility corporations and they need to conform to social expectations. This means also moral responsibilities. Therefore it means that companies should not damage the environement. Nowadays it appears that cocial responsibility should be an essential part of any business. Social responsibility can be also expensive but it seems that it gives benefits to companies such as satisfatcion of employees. Social responsibility is also a good method to mantain a public image through various initiatives.\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.The reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In India, robots are increasingly used in various sectors. In factories, they enhance production speed and accuracy by handling tasks like assembly and packaging. In hospitals, robots assist in surgeries and diagnostics, improving healthcare efficiency and patient outcomes. On farms, robots help with planting, harvesting, and monitoring crops, boosting agricultural productivity. In the service industry, robots are appearing in shops and hotels, assisting customers and enhancing service quality.\n\nI believe robots can significantly benefit society by taking over repetitive, dangerous, or tedious tasks, allowing people to focus on more creative and complex work. This can lead to increased efficiency and safety across different industries. However, there are concerns about job displacement, as robots might replace human workers, leading to unemployment and the need for new skills.

{"text": "Prompt Level: Aviation [SEP] Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is made up of several important parts, each with a specific function to help the aircraft fly safely and efficiently. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane. It holds the cockpit, where the pilots sit, and the cabin, where passengers and cargo are stored. It connects all other parts of the aircraft.\n\nThe wings are essential for lift. As the airplane moves forward, air flows over and under the wings, creating lift that allows the airplane to rise off the ground. Most airplanes have two wings, one on each side of the fuselage.\n\nAt the back of the airplane is the tail, which includes the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. The tail helps keep the airplane stable during flight and controls the direction in which it moves. The vertical stabilizer keeps the plane from yawing side to side, while the horizontal stabilizer keeps it from pitching up or down.\n\nThe engines provide the power needed for flight. They push the airplane forward, allowing the wings to generate lift. Some airplanes have engines under the wings, while others have them at the rear of the fuselage.\n\nTogether, these parts work in harmony to ensure a safe flight.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: The proposal to cut physical education and sports classes in favor of test preparation classes is a significant change that could have both positive and negative impacts on students.\n\nOn one hand, increasing test preparation time could potentially improve students' academic performance and test scores. This could be particularly beneficial for students who struggle with standardized tests and need extra support to succeed. Additionally, higher test scores could enhance the school's overall performance metrics and reputation.\n\nHowever, there are several reasons to be concerned about eliminating physical education and sports classes. Physical activity is crucial for students' physical health, mental well-being, and overall development. Regular exercise helps reduce stress, improve concentration, and boost mood, which can positively impact academic performance. Moreover, sports and physical education classes teach important life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.\n\nBalancing academic preparation with physical activity is essential for a well-rounded education. Instead of completely cutting physical education and sports, the school committee could consider a more balanced approach. For example, they could reduce the frequency of physical education classes while still maintaining some level of physical activity for students. This way, students can benefit from both academic support and physical exercise.", "task_id": "8dab61c3-5199-4396-87e2-1618ae59b47a", "level_title": "7-Intermediate", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Law [SEP] Prompt: You are a new member of a law firm who is shadowing your more experienced colleague. Listen to the closing arguments and the verdict of a tort action trial for trespassing, and take notes for future reference. [SEP] Response: \nLast month, an interesting lawsuit began that opens a window into our changing economy and, perhaps, our changing society.\n\nJohn Bottoms, ex-CFO of the US steel conglomerate Big Steel Co., was made redundant due to, in the company’s words, ‘our changing financial climate’. Bottoms had worked in the company for over thirty years and was therefore due a decent severance package. He was, however, only 49 at the time, and would be competing with jobseekers ten or twenty years his junior. Finding another job equal to the one he had lost might prove to be impossible.\n\nIt was with this in mind that Bottoms came to a startling decision: turn down the severance package and sue Big Steel Co.\n\nCrazy? Perhaps. Brave? Definitely. Yet Bottoms was only following what is becoming a new trend in the legal area of contracts and employment: unlawful dismissal and unfair severance packages. Over the last five years, the number of employment-related civil court actions – not just in the area of severance disputes, but also sexual harassment, racial discrimination and unfair dismissal – has more than doubled.\n\nThe largest increase in these disputes has been for age discrimination. Trends show that employees are staying on in a company longer than previous generations. Yet, companies often want to let go their more elderly staff and invest in youth. Hence the reason for so many disputes. Experts, however, say it might not be the case that there is more discrimination in the workplace than before, rather there is more awareness of the issue.\n\nWhatever the case may be, companies are taking action to guard against future lawsuits. One such action is the purchasing of liability insurance policies which cover potential employment-related claims. Perhaps Big Steel Co. is wishing it had had such a policy in place, as they’re facing a hefty pay-out to a vindicated Bottoms.", "task_id": "f78e1e91-5009-4533-a737-54c9aa0c5353", "level_title": "Law", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Robots have become a pervasive and an increasingly integral part of our society and daily lives. The use of artificial intelligence has allowed for a faster and more efficient way to build robots, effectively increasing automation in many industries. \nRobots can offer increased productivity, efficiency, quality, and consistency. Robots can't get bored with their job. Until they switch off, they can repeat the same task continuously. Robots can be very accurate than humans, that's why robots are used in the manufacturing of microelectronics.\nFrom the one hand, robots could take on some of the most strenuous, physically intensive and risky tasks reducing workers' risk. On the other hand, the competition with robots may increase the pressure on workers who may lose their jobs or be forced to retrain.\nAI is a machine, and machines do not have emotions. They can simulate emotions to some extent, but they do not actually feel them. Emotions are a complex mix of physiological and psychological responses to external stimuli. And machines simply do not have the necessary biology or consciousness to experience them.\nSo robots have both positive and negative impacts.\n", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 3}

[SEP] Response: Change is a natural part of life. Whether it's starting a new job, moving to a different city, or adjusting to unexpected circumstances, change challenges us to grow and adapt. Although it can be uncomfortable at first, change often brings new opportunities and fresh perspectives.\n\nMany people resist change because it brings uncertainty. It takes us out of our comfort zones and forces us to confront the unknown. However, resisting change can hold us back from reaching our full potential. By embracing it, we open the door to personal development and transformation.\n\nTo make the most of change, it’s important to stay positive, set clear goals, and remain flexible. Accepting that not everything is within our control allows us to focus on what we can influence. Even setbacks can become stepping stones toward success when we adopt a mindset of growth.\n\nSurrounding ourselves with supportive people and taking time to reflect can also help during transitons.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find focused free writing and questioning the most useful. Focused free writing allows me to channel my thoughts in a structured yet creative way. By concentrating on a single topic, I can delve deeper into my ideas without the distraction of unrelated tangents. This technique helps me overcome writer’s block and often leads to unexpected insights that improve the depth of my work. It’s especially effective when exploring complex subjects or drafting the initial stages of an essay.\n\nOn the other hand, questioning is a technique that encourages curiosity and critical thinking. By asking \"why,\" \"how,\" and \"what if\" questions, I can examine a topic from multiple perspectives, uncovering hidden layers of meaning. This method enhances my analytical skills and ensures that my writing addresses potential questions a reader might have, making it more engaging and comprehensive.\n\nThese techniques complement each other well; focused free writing generates raw ideas, while questioning refines and organizes them into coherent, impactful content. Together, they form a powerful foundation for my creative and academic writing processes.\n", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Read an email from your friend and give advice on some stressful problems he is having. Type in the input box. Write 100-200 words. [SEP] Response: Stressful situations are an inevitable part of daily life, but simple strategies can help navigate them effectively. To start, practicing mindfulness can be a game-changer. Take a few minutes each day to focus on your breathing, clear your mind, and center yourself—this helps reduce stress and enhances clarity.\nPlanning ahead is another useful technique. Organize your tasks and prioritize them. Break larger goals into smaller, manageable steps to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Keeping a to-do list or using productivity apps can be beneficial.\nWhen tensions rise, physical activity works wonders. A brisk walk, yoga, or even stretching can release endorphins and improve your mood. Pair this with a healthy diet and adequate sleep, as physical well-being directly affects mental health.\nLastly, don’t underestimate the power of connection. Reach out to friends or family, or find supportive communities. Sharing concerns and seeking advice can lighten the burden.\nAbove all, be kind to yourself. Recognize that setbacks happen, and perfection isn’t the goal—progress is. Implementing these habits can turn chaos into calm, one step at a time.\n", "task_id": "9032f3ed-5da1-4efe-b4dd-c9470bb35d65", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Buying a house is one of the biggest dreams come true for most people and an extravagant affair altogether. Imparting life to such a dream requires a lot of effort from the buyers’ end and the best one can do to accommodate the home in their budget is through a home loan.\n\nA home loan can be opted to buy a new house/flat or a plot of land where you construct the house, and even for renovation, extension, and repairs to an existing house. This is the most common type of home loan availed to purchase a house. There are many housing finance companies, public banks, and private banks that offer housing loans where you borrow money to purchase the house of your choice and repay the loan in monthly instalments.\n\nYou can get up to 80%-90% of the house’s market price in the form of financing. The lender will hold the house until you completely repay the loan. The current home loan interest rate may be overwhelming, or you may not be happy with your current lender’s service; you can transfer the home loan’s outstanding balance to a different lender who offers a lower interest rate and better service. Upon transfer, you can even check out the possibilities of a top-up loan on your existing one. ", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}

Some stories describe him riding a wild boar and using magical powers to create confusing paths. Though mischievous, the Curupira isn't evil—his goal is to defend the balance of nature.\n\nThe myth of the Curupira is still popular today, especially in rural regions and among children learning about folklore. His story serves as a warning about respecting the environment and living in harmony with nature.

Homeownership is highly valued, but rising real estate prices, especially in metropolitan areas, make it a significant financial commitment.\n\nThe process begins with identifying a suitable property through real estate agents, online portals, or direct builders. Many buyers prefer using real estate agents for better property options and smoother negotiations. Once a property is finalized, applying for a home loan is the next step.\n\nHome loan applications involve extensive paperwork. Banks require identity proof, income statements, employment details, property documents, and credit history. Loan approvals depend on the applicant's credit score, income stability, and the property’s legal status. Interest rates in India typically range from 7% to 9%, though they vary based on market conditions and the applicant’s financial profile. Both fixed and floating interest rate options are available.\n\nThe process can be time-consuming due to multiple verifications and legal formalities. Buyers often hire legal advisors to ensure the property has a clear title. While applying directly to banks is common, many people use mortgage brokers to compare loan offers and secure better terms.\n\nOverall, while buying a home in India involves significant effort, proper planning and financial management can simplify the journey toward homeownership.\n", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: My take on CSR\nBy Tom Brown\nCorporate Social Responsibility, or CSR, as the name just says, is the responsibility that companies have with actions far all of the profit, with eyes in the well-live of society and the environment. The companies are made of people that work and that consomem products and services, for example, so it is very important that the corporate have responsibility with the society and no goal only the profit. As an integral part of society, these companies need to conform to social expectations, and that entails moral responsibilities. The companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. The consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit. This is the game gain-gain. There are situations such as If a company ensures fair benefits for its staff, it usually enjoys less turnover and higher productivity. While companies have a responsibility to increase their profits on behalf of their shareholders, companies should not take solely from society. It is the role of the government to make and enforce laws and regulations that benefit the general public, since the government will also have to spend less on the needs of society. Corporations need to adapt to these requirements, and the government's role is to regulate and monitor.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 2}

[SEP] Response: The Impact of Technology on Modern Life\n\nIn today’s world, technology plays a central role in almost every aspect of our daily lives. From the moment we wake up to the time we go to sleep, we are surrounded by devices, software, and systems designed to make life easier, faster, and more efficient. But while technology has brought many advantages, it has also introduced challenges and raised important questions about how we live and interact with the world.\n\nOne of the most significant changes brought by technology is the way we communicate. Just a few decades ago, people relied on letters and landline phones to stay in touch. Now, with the rise of smartphones, social media, and messaging apps, communication is instant and global. This has helped people stay connected across long distances and made it easier to share ideas and information. However, it has also led to concerns about privacy, screen addiction, and the decline of face-to-face interactions.\n\nAnother area where technology has had a huge impact is in education. Online learning platforms, virtual classrooms, and educational apps have made learning more accessible to people all over the world. Students can now study at their own pace and access a wide range of resources that were previously out of reach. Teachers, too, can use technology to create more engaging and personalized lessons. Still, not everyone has equal access to digital tools, and this digital divide can create gaps in educational opportunities.\n\nIn the workplace, automation and artificial intelligence are transforming industries. Machines can now perform tasks that once required human labor, from manufacturing to customer service. This can increase efficiency and reduce costs, but it also means that many jobs are changing or disappearing altogether. Workers must learn new skills to keep up, and governments must consider how to support those affected by these changes.\n\nHealth care has also been revolutionized by technology. Medical professionals use advanced tools for diagnosis, surgery, and patient monitoring. Telemedicine allows doctors to consult with patients remotely, improving access in rural or underserved areas. At the same time, the storage and protection of digital health records raise ethical and security concerns.\n\nDespite its many benefits, technology is not without risks. Cybersecurity threats, misinformation, and the loss of privacy are growing problems. The rapid pace of innovation can outstrip our ability to regulate it effectively. Society must find ways to balance technological progress with ethical considerations and human well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, technology has transformed modern life in profound ways. It connects us, educates us, and empowers us, but it also challenges us to think critically about how we use it. As we move forward, it is important to make thoughtful choices that ensure technology serves humanity—not the other way around.\n\n\n", "task_id": "48b78e21-bcae-4548-a0e9-1e150343125a", "level_title": "4-Elementary", "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in Haiti\n\nTo buy a house in Haiti, you must follow some specific steps depending on your economic situation.\nYou may not have the money to do so.\nIf you can, after visiting the house and talking with the owner, you may jointly make an appointment with a notary to sign the agreement and pay.\nIs the process easy or difficult?\nThe process can be easy as long as both the buyer and the seller are positive and must follow the standard rules.\nAre there many forms to fill out?\nThe form that the buyer and the seller are supposed to sign is the agreement form after answering specific questions and showing all the necessary identification documents. Then the notary will get the paper from the revenue office called DGI confirming that you own the house.\nIs housing expensive?\nA very low-income house could cost around ten thousand dollars. A very small house could cost around fifty thousand dollars. An average house could cost around two hundred thousand dollars. A high-end home could cost around $1 million and more.\nWhat are the interest rates?\nThe interest rate is around 10%. Buying and reselling a home will typically cost around 10% or more of the home’s value. These costs mean that if the home has only increased in value by around 10% in the year or two you’ve lived in it, you’re not going to make any money (the equity gain from paying down principal is very small in the first few years).\nDo you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker?\nMost of the time, people use their own contacts to find a home instead of dealing with a real estate agent. But these real estate professionals or companies exist and can help you.\nApplying for a home loan\nThe down payment for a home loan is no longer between 25% and 30%, according to a former program manager at the Central Bank of Haiti. The deadline is more reasonable and the central bank, the BRH, will work with financial institutions to facilitate the feasibility of a program related to it, he added.\nThere are many other possibilities to obtain a home loan in Haiti even if the rates are a little high.\n\nEF Student\n", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}

It happens that an individual can select his property and can then approach to the bank, or the individual can walk in directly to the bank to run through all the property documents and can select a property based on bank's loan criteria on the property. Post selection of the property, a bank will perform checks related to finance and other legal contracts with respect to the individual as well as with the property as well. checks including credit worthiness, credit scores are being checked by the bank. Details such as employment details, previous loan are being checked by the bank to identify credit worthiness. The individual needs to submit all details as required by the bank and bank conducts its own way of checks. Checks are also performed on the property including checks for any dispute of property, clearance from local municipality, previous owners are checked.

While it’s true that she has built an impressive brand and business empire, it's hard to ignore that much of her fame originated not from talent or hard work in the traditional sense, but from media exposure and controversy. To be fair, she has shown skill in marketing and personal branding, but many argue that she represents the more superficial side of fame.\n\nIt could be said that celebrities like her promote unrealistic beauty standards and materialism. For instance, her frequent use of photo editing and cosmetic procedures may contribute to young people feeling inadequate about their own appearances. Furthermore, some would argue that she rarely uses her platform to advocate for meaningful causes, although she has recently tried to rebrand herself as a legal reform activist.\n\nIn my opinion, the obsession with celebrity culture, especially with people who are famous for being famous, distracts society from more important issues. It’s not entirely her fault—after all, the media plays a big role—but it raises questions about what we value in public figures.\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to discuss the various issues and challenges faced by language students. As someone working in the education sector, it is apparent that language learning comes with its fair share of difficulties.\nFirstly, one of the major challenges is pronunciation. Learning the correct pronunciation of a foreign language can be quite daunting for students. The subtle nuances and unique sounds often require continuous practice and guidance from experienced instructors.\nSecondly, grammar and vocabulary can be stumbling blocks. Understanding the grammatical rules and expanding one's vocabulary can be overwhelming. Students often struggle to remember and apply the correct grammar structures, as well as to acquire a wide range of vocabulary.\nFurthermore, cultural differences and communication barriers can pose challenges. Language learners need to familiarize themselves with the cultural context, idiomatic expressions, and different social norms associated with a language. Building cross-cultural understanding and effective communication skills can be time-consuming.\nLastly, motivation plays a vital role. Language learning requires dedication and perseverance. Students may face fatigue or lack of motivation along their learning journey, hindering their progress.\nIn conclusion, language students encounter various issues and challenges, such as pronunciation, grammar/vocabulary, cultural differences, and motivation. Overcoming these challenges requires support from educators, tailored teaching methodologies, and a positive learning environment.\nWishing you success in your language learning endeavors.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Dear Pete,\nThank you for sharing your concerns. I see that some of your habits are negatively affecting your well-being. Long hours at work and excessive stress lead to poor sleep, which in turn causes fatigue. Using coffee as an energy source only worsens the problem, as it disrupts your sleep cycle. Sitting for long periods of time contributes to back pain, and lack of exercise makes it difficult to control your weight. Smoking and unhealthy food are even more detrimental to your health.\nTo improve your lifestyle, I recommend:\n• Reducing stress: Taking short breaks, deep breathing, and prioritizing tasks can help.\n• Improving sleep: Cutting back on caffeine, establishing a sleep routine, and reducing screen time will improve rest.\n• Eating a healthier diet: Including whole foods, staying hydrated, and cutting back on junk food will increase energy levels.\n• Moving more: Using a standing desk, stretching, and taking regular walks can help relieve back pain.\n• Quitting smoking: This will improve lung health,  and overall well-being.\nThese changes will help you feel more energetic, focused, and healthy.

[SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in my country is a process that involves multiple steps but is relatively manageable with preparation. First, housing costs can vary significantly depending on the location. In large urban centers, property prices are generally high, making affordability a challenge for many people. However, in suburban or rural areas, homes tend to be much more reasonably priced. The process of applying for a home loan begins with gathering financial documents, such as proof of income, tax returns, and credit history. Banks and financial institutions evaluate these documents to determine your eligibility and loan amount. Interest rates depend on economic conditions and the applicant’s credit. There is indeed a lot of paperwork involved. You must fill out detailed  forms, sign legal agreements, and provide property documents for verification. Many people opt to work with real estate agents or mortgage brokers, as they can simplify the process, negotiate better terms, and ensure that all documentation is in order.\nwhile the process can be time-consuming and bureaucratic, proper planning and professional assistance can make buying a home a smoother experience.

We have to be clear: those suggestions are nonsense. These completely false claims were released just at the time, as construction for Mishima Corporation's new HQ building is starting. As you must know, White Space beat 20 other top agencies to get the contract from Mishima for the design, wich Mr. Mishima approved himself. Also, in the coming years, we have got three another big contracts lined up. The rise in our profits in the past three years should speak for itself. Our legal team has taken action to seek compensation from those who spread these absurd rumors. We want to let our clients know, that we will protect them as well as our company from these irresponsible rumors.", "task_id": "df5688dd-3713-446a-900e-66e29dc6182f", "level_title": "Correspondence", "label": 4}

Read the question, then write a suitable answer. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi there,\n\nFirst off, it’s great to hear that you’re considering a career in medicine! Becoming a doctor is indeed a long and challenging journey, but it’s also incredibly rewarding. Medical training typically starts with a four-year medical school program after your undergraduate degree, followed by several years of residency and possibly fellowship. Clinical training is hands-on, involving a lot of direct patient care, which can be tough at times due to the emotional and physical demands. You’ll work long hours, deal with complex cases, and continually be learning. But it’s also where you build your skills and truly begin to understand the practice of medicine.\n\nThere are many options within the medical field. You could specialize in areas like surgery, pediatrics, cardiology, psychiatry, or family medicine, to name a few. Each specialty has its own unique path and lifestyle.\n\nAs for finances, medical residents and fellows are indeed paid, but it often feels like a tight budget due to the years of training and student loans. While the pay increases significantly as you become an attending physician, you may need to budget carefully in the earlier years.\n\nWorking in a clinic or hospital is fast-paced and can be stressful, but it’s also where you can make a real difference in patients’ lives. You'll work with a team, and though there are challenges, many find the sense of fulfillment to be worth it.\n\nI hope this helps! Feel free to reach out if you have more questions.

Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: The media landscape has undergone dramatic changes over the past few decades, shaped by technological advancements, shifting consumer habits, and societal transformations. From the dominance of print newspapers to the rise of digital platforms, these changes have revolutionized how we create, consume, and interact with information.\n\n1. Traditional to Digital\nIn the past, media was primarily distributed through newspapers, magazines, radio, and television. These formats followed a one-way communication model where media organizations produced content, and audiences consumed it passively. The internet disrupted this model, introducing digital media platforms that allow for instantaneous, global communication. Online publications, blogs, and social media have replaced much of the print industry, offering faster access to information and diverse perspectives.\n\n2. The Rise of Social Media\nSocial media has transformed how we interact with media, making it more personal, participatory, and immediate. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter (now X), Instagram, and TikTok enable users to become content creators, bypassing traditional gatekeepers. This shift has democratized information but also introduced challenges, such as misinformation and the erosion of trust in reliable sources.\n\n3. 24/7 News Cycle\nThe advent of cable news and later online news platforms introduced the 24/7 news cycle, drastically increasing the speed of reporting. While this provides timely updates, it also pressures media outlets to prioritize speed over depth, sometimes leading to inaccuracies or sensationalism.", "task_id": "7e0827d0-955c-484a-8c4f-81fe6a574af8", "level_title": "11-Upper Intermediate", "label": 5}

Make it interesting and descriptive, and remember to check for pronoun reference. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: I picked up Emily Henry’s Beach Read a couple of years ago when I found out she was a fellow Hope College alum, and there were a few references to unique Hope experiences, such as late-night donut adventures. I quickly became a fan. Her storytelling is unmatched and I eagerly await every new release. Last month, when she released Funny Story, I picked it up at my local bookshop that day and finished it within the week! Once again, her one-of-a-kind character building told a story I couldn’t put down.\n\nI will give a bit of a disclaimer up front: this book did have a bit more “spice” than I would usually go for, but for me, the storytelling made the read worth it for me.\n\nDaphne, a librarian, moved to her fiance Peter’s hometown of Waning Bay, Michigan to start a life together. Daphne adores the way he tells their love story, but their life together comes to a screeching halt when he realizes he’s in love with his childhood best friend Petra.\n\nDaphne moves in with Petra’s ex fiance, Miles, so Petra and Peter can move in together, leaving Daphne and Miles to put their lives back together. Despite finding themselves in similar life situations, the newfound roommates couldn’t be more opposite. For example, Miles is neighborly and knows everyone in town while Daphne’s coworkers think she’s a secret agent since no one knows anything about her life. \n\nThey do their best to coexist and avoid each other in the apartment, but eventually start to form a friendship due to their close quarters. Begrudgingly, Daphne agrees to let Miles show her around town, with a countdown to her eagerly awaited Read-A-Thon (the only thing keeping her in Waning Bay) and an unexpected plan to deceive their exes.\n\nDaphne’s job as a librarian means several book references throughout the story, which warms my bookish heart. From a Station Eleven reference to alluding to the author characters from Henry’s Beach Read, these references are a bonus to help the reader illustrate Daphne’s personality based on her literary favorites. \n\nBoth Daphne and Miles are surprised by unexpected visitors, which brings some bumps in the road for their relationship – and a full apartment which presents its own challenges. Again, their different life paths leave them in a similar situation: putting the pieces together from the relationships that have deeply affected their own stories. \n\nOne of my favorite quotes which is perfectly descriptive of Daphne and Miles’ relationships with their exes and families, and affects how they view their relationship with each other, is Daphne’s advice on waiting.\n\n“You can’t force a person to show up, but you can learn a lesson when they don’t.\n\nTrust people’s actions, not their words.\n\nDon’t love anyone who isn’t ready to love you back.\n\nLet go of the people who don’t hold on to you.\n\nDon’t wait on anyone who’s in no rush to get to you.”\n\nThey also continue finding favorite Waning Bay spots, with their sidekick, Daphne’s cowo", "task_id": "52a760cd-9898-4cce-bb43-c490923b2b45", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in the United States can be a complex and sometimes daunting process, particularly for first-time buyers. The process involves several steps and significant paperwork, but with preparation and understanding, it can be managed effectively.\n\nFirstly, the housing market in the U.S. varies significantly by region. In many urban areas and popular cities, housing can be quite expensive, with prices often rising faster than the national average. Conversely, rural and less densely populated areas might offer more affordable options.\n\nWhen it comes to financing, applying for a home loan (mortgage) is a multi-step process. Potential buyers need to gather financial documentation, such as income statements, tax returns, and credit reports. Lenders will evaluate these to determine creditworthiness. The process involves filling out substantial paperwork, including a loan application and various disclosures.\n\nInterest rates fluctuate based on economic conditions, but as of 2023, they have been relatively high compared to previous years, hovering around 6-7% for a 30-year fixed mortgage. Lower rates might be available for those with excellent credit scores or who opt for adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nWhile it's not mandatory to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker, they can be incredibly helpful. Real estate agents guide buyers through the home search and negotiation process, while mortgage brokers can assist in finding competitive loan rates and terms. These professionals can streamline the process, making it more manageable and less stressful.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

This report outlines the observed problems and provides recommendations for improvement.\nAs it follows, the main observations are concerning  the approaching angle of the  Cessna 123 as it  approached the runway at a steeper angle than recommended, resulting in a hard touchdown. \nAs to the  flare timing, the pilot initiated the flare too late, causing the aircraft to touch down abruptly and finally, as far as the crosswind handling is concerned, Cessna 123 struggled to maintain alignment with the runway during crosswind conditions.\nSome Recommendations:\nAs to timing, we suggest that the pilot should undergo additional training on proper approach and flare techniques.\nConcerning crosswind training we suggest that the specific crosswind landing training is essential to improve handling during adverse conditions. \nIn respect to the review SOPs, we suggest that it is ensured adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs) for safe landings.\n\nIn conclusion, addressing these issues will enhance safety and prevent similar incidents in the future.

[SEP] Response: \n\nReport on Alberta Oil Fields – Potential for Oil Extraction\n\nThis report presents an assessment of the potential for oil extraction in the Alberta oil fields, based on my recent visit to the region.\n\nAlberta’s oil sands hold a vast quantity of bitumen resources, making them a significant area for potential oil production. The estimated operating costs vary depending on the product type: between $6 and $14 per barrel for bitumen, and between $18 and $22 per barrel for synthetic crude. Similarly, supply costs range from $14 to $24 per barrel for bitumen and $36 to $40 per barrel for synthetic crude. These figures suggest that while extraction is feasible, costs can vary considerably depending on the method and product.\n\nForecasts indicate that the total oil supply is expected to reach 3.9 million barrels per day by 2015. This significant increase will likely lead to expansion in traditional markets and create a need for entry into new markets.\n\nConclusion: Alberta oil fields have strong potential for future development. However, successful extraction will depend on market demands and cost-efficiency.\n\nRecommendations: It is essential to monitor oil prices closely, gather more detailed data, and evaluate the long-term costs of production and transportation to ensure sustainable investment.\n\n\n", "task_id": "b99c403f-3a8e-4397-a157-2644d1952584", "level_title": "Oil and Gas Industry", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Mermaids have long captivated human imagination with their enchanting allure and mystical presence. Often depicted as half-human, half-fish creatures, they have been a staple of folklore and mythology across various cultures.

Similarly, in Scandinavian lore, the mermaid-like \"havfrue\" was considered both a portent of stormy seas and a harbinger of good fortune, depending on the tale. These mythical beings often symbolize the unknown mysteries of the ocean, a vast and uncharted realm that has always fascinated humankind. The allure of mermaids is not only in their beauty and mystery but also in the duality they represent: the harmonious yet potentially perilous relationship between humans and nature.\n\nIn modern times, mermaids continue to be popular in literature, film, and art, often embodying themes of transformation and freedom. From Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Little Mermaid\" to recent depictions in movies and television, mermaids often portray a longing for connection and understanding between varied worlds. These narratives frequently explore identity and the sacrifices made in the pursuit of dreams or love. Moreover, mermaids have become symbols of environmental awareness, representing the need to protect our oceans and marine life. Their enduring presence in popular culture underscores a timeless allure that bridges fantasy with real-world issues, inviting audiences to ponder the depths of both the sea and the human spirit.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home in India is a significant financial decision that involves several steps, including selecting the property, securing financing, and completing legal formalities. The process begins with identifying the right location, type of property, and builder or developer reputation. Prospective buyers often conduct thorough market research, assess amenities, and check property prices and appreciation trends.\n\nOnce a property is selected, most buyers opt for a home loan to finance their purchase. Applying for a home loan in India involves approaching banks or financial institutions and submitting necessary documents such as identity proof, income proof, property details, and credit history. The lender evaluates the applicant's creditworthiness, repayment capacity, and property value before sanctioning the loan.\n\nInterest rates for home loans can be fixed or floating, and applicants should compare rates from various lenders to find the best deal. Additionally, understanding loan terms, processing fees, and prepayment options is crucial. After loan approval, the buyer must complete the property's legal due diligence, including title verification and registration.\n\nOwning a home in India is often seen as a milestone, offering both financial security and personal satisfaction. Careful planning and prudent financial management are key to navigating the complexities of buying a home and securing a loan.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

But, recent studies have shown a change in behavior that suggests, in the future, there will be fewer cars on the road and an increase in the use of public transport.\nOne reason for this change is that young professionals use tecnology to partecipate at meetings and because they prefer use their electronic device while another people drive. They arrive at work more relaxed.\nAnother factor is the issue of sustainability. The development of public transport into a greener and more convenient option, especially in major cities. \nAnother industry undergoing changes is air travel. Airlines seem to have thought of every possible way to eliminate cost, from downsizing to reducing the number of flights.\nAbout the next, the space tourism become more important.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Navagunjara is a fascinating creature from the Indian epic the Mahabharata, especially in the version told in Odisha called the Sarala Mahabharata. This mythical creature is made up of parts from different animals, symbolizing the diversity and unity of life.\n\nNavagunjara has the head of a rooster, the neck of a peacock, the back of a bull, the waist of a lion, the tail of a snake, and three legs from an elephant, a tiger, and a deer. It also has one human arm holding a lotus or a wheel. Each part represents different qualities, coming together to form one amazing being.\n\nIn the story, Navagunjara appears to Arjuna, one of the Pandava brothers, during his exile. While meditating, Arjuna sees this strange creature and is initially surprised by its unusual shape. However, he soon realizes that Navagunjara is actually Lord Krishna in disguise, testing his faith and understanding. Recognizing its divine nature Arjuna bows in respect understanding the deeper meaning of its form.\n\nThe story of Navagunjara teaches a lesson about unity in diversity showing how different elements can come together in harmony. This idea fits with the larger themes in the Mahabharata which celebrates the complexity and interconnectedness of life.\n\nIn Odisha, artists often depict Navagunjara in Pattachitra, a traditional style of painting on cloth. These artworks capture the creature's unique form with detailed and colorful designs reflecting its spiritual significance. Through these artistic expressions, the legend of Navagunjara continues to inspire people to think about the mysteries of life and the unity that connects everything.\n\nThe tale of Navagunjara is an important part of Odisha's rich storytelling tradition, blending myth, art, and philosophy into stories that share timeless wisdom and cultural identity.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: In India, robots are increasingly being integrated into various sectors, transforming industries and daily life. The manufacturing sector, particularly the automotive industry, is a major user of industrial robots, with installations reaching record highs1. Robots are employed for tasks such as assembly, welding, and painting, enhancing efficiency and precision. Additionally, the healthcare sector is leveraging robotic technology for surgeries, diagnostics, and patient care, improving outcomes and accessibility2.\n\nAgriculture is another area where robots are making a significant impact.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a trade deal between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, implemented on January 1, 1994. Its primary goal was to eliminate trade barriers, such as tariffs and import quotas, to encourage economic cooperation among the three nations. By removing these restrictions, NAFTA aimed to boost trade, create jobs, and enhance economic growth across North America.\n\nNAFTA significantly increased trade between the member countries, particularly in industries like agriculture, automobiles, and manufacturing. However, the agreement faced criticism for causing job losses in certain sectors, particularly in the U.S., as some companies relocated production to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs. Environmental and labor concerns also arose, prompting debates about the agreement’s overall impact.\n\nIn 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which introduced updates to labor laws, environmental regulations, and digital trade rules. The USMCA aimed to address some of NAFTA’s shortcomings while maintaining the core benefits of free trade among the three countries.\n\nDespite its controversies, NAFTA played a significant role in shaping North American trade and economic relations for over 25 years.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.", "task_id": "bb0d114c-9550-4f27-9138-b2eb14c39437", "level_title": "Law", "label": 5}

It holds the cockpit, where the pilots control the aircraft, and the cabin, where passengers and cargo are carried.\n\nThe wings are attached to the sides of the fuselage and are essential for flight. As the airplane moves forward, air flows over and under the wings, creating lift that allows the plane to rise into the air.\n\nAt the rear of the airplane is the tail, which includes the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. These parts help keep the airplane balanced and stable during flight.

Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in my country can be a complex and time-consuming process, though it varies depending on the buyer’s circumstances. The process generally starts with getting pre-approved for a loan, which involves submitting a variety of financial documents such as proof of income, credit history, and existing debts. Once that’s done, the search for a home begins, often with the help of a real estate agent, though some buyers may choose to go it alone.\n\nWhen it comes to the home loan application itself, there are indeed many forms to fill out. These forms cover everything from personal details to financial information and the specifics of the property. It can feel like a mountain of paperwork, and mistakes or missed details can delay the process. Housing prices in my country are quite high, especially in urban areas, making it challenging for first-time buyers to afford a property. As for interest rates, they can fluctuate, but currently, they tend to hover around the mid-range depending on the loan type and the buyer's creditworthiness.\n\nMost people do choose to work with a mortgage broker to navigate the loan process since they can help find the best rates and terms. While not absolutely necessary, having a broker can make the experience less stressful and increase the chances of securing a favorable deal. Overall, the process can be difficult, but with the right assistance, it is manageable.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Buying our own house is every person's dream. There is a saying that we need three things to live : food, clothes and home to live in. In India, I am planning to purchase my own home at South City Pinnacle, 11th floor, EP Block. Applying for a home loan is quite a tiresome task and I am thinking of applying for a home loan in one of the most reputable financial institution of India which is HDFC Bank. I have heard that they are quite supportive when providing home loans with low processing fees and is currently disbursing home loans at 8.50% interest rate which is one of the lowest in India. \n\nGenerally, they ask to provide a single form for home loan. The house which I am planning is purchase costs around 10 million Indian rupees (INR). The maximum amount of loan which will be granted to me will be 0.8 million INR at 8.50% for a term of 16 years.

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In Mexico, robots are being integrated into various industries, from manufacturing and agriculture to healthcare and retail. In factories, robotic arms assemble cars and electronics with precision, boosting productivity and reducing costs. In agriculture, drones and robotic harvesters are helping farmers optimize planting, irrigation, and harvesting processes, increasing efficiency in a sector vital to the economy. Robots are also starting to appear in hospitals, assisting with surgeries or delivering medication, and in retail, they enhance customer experiences by providing information or managing inventory. I find this growing presence of robots exciting yet complex. They promise significant benefits: increased efficiency, reduced human error, and the potential to take on dangerous or repetitive tasks. However, their impact is not entirely positive. Automation could lead to job displacement in certain sectors, requiring workers to upskill or face unemployment. Additionally, the reliance on technology raises concerns about data security and ethical usage. In the long term, robots will likely reshape society, demanding thoughtful policies and education systems to ensure a balance between technological progress and social well-being.

[SEP] Response: Keanu Reeves is one of the few celebrities who truly deserves his fame. Unlike many in Hollywood, he is known not only for his talent but also for his humility and generosity. It’s refreshing to see a public figure who stays grounded despite his success. He consistently avoids the spotlight and does not seek attention through scandals or luxury.\n\nWhat I admire most about Keanu Reeves is how he treats people with respect, regardless of their status. Stories of him giving up his seat on the subway or donating large portions of his salary to crew members show his true character. He seems to value kindness and professionalism over ego and fame.\n\nSome might say he is too quiet or private to be a celebrity, but I believe that’s exactly what makes him so special. He challenges the stereotype of the arrogant Hollywood star and reminds us that being famous doesn’t mean being self-centered.\n\nIn conclusion, Keanu Reeves is a positive example of what a celebrity can and should be.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Realizing the horror of what she had done, she drowned herself as well. Her soul was cursed to wander the earth for eternity, searching for her children. People say that on quiet nights near rivers or lakes, you can hear her crying, “¡Ay, mis hijos!” (“Oh, my children!”). She is often described wearing a long white dress, with long black hair and a pale, sorrowful face. Many parents use this legend to warn children not to go out at night or near dangerous waters. La Llorona is more than just a ghost story — she reflects themes of love, betrayal, guilt, and punishment, which are deeply rooted in Mexican culture and folklore.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

I believe leadership begins with taking initiative, being responsible, and making decisions that benefit the entire team, not just oneself.  Confidence is essential, but so is humility.  Leaders admit mistakes and use failures as opportunities to grow.  They also empower others by recognizing their strengths and encouraging them to take ownership.

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find free writing and questioning to be particularly useful. Free writing allows for the uninhibited flow of ideas, helping to overcome writer's block and uncover hidden thoughts and perspectives. By writing continuously without worrying about grammar or structure, I can explore my thoughts more deeply and generate raw material that can be refined later.\n\nQuestioning, on the other hand, is a powerful technique for developing ideas and deepening understanding. By asking questions about a topic, I can explore different angles and uncover new insights. This technique helps in creating a more comprehensive and nuanced piece of writing. It encourages critical thinking and ensures that I consider various aspects of the subject matter.\n\nCombining these techniques, I can start with free writing to generate ideas and then use questioning to refine and expand on those ideas. This approach not only enhances creativity but also ensures that my writing is well-rounded and thoroughly explored.

[SEP] Response: Paris and New York are two of the most iconic cities in the world, each offering unique experiences and cultural richness. Paris, known as the \"City of Light,\" is renowned for its romantic ambiance, historic architecture, and world-class cuisine. Walking along the Seine River, visitors can admire landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame Cathedral, immersing themselves in the city’s rich artistic heritage. Paris offers a slower pace of life, with quaint cafés and charming streets inviting leisurely exploration.\n\nIn contrast, New York is a bustling metropolis that never sleeps. The city's skyline is dominated by towering skyscrapers, including the Empire State Building and One World Trade Center. Unlike Paris, where tradition is deeply rooted, New York thrives on constant change and innovation.

Use the categories provided and type into the input box. Write 80-100 words. Categories: general cargo safety and stowage; staffing levels and working conditions; general condition and maintenance of the vessel; safety standards [SEP] Response: Caía uma chuva miúda, quase pó! A luz mortiça dos candeeiros deixava antever traços finos e oblíquos de água fria. Alcina refugiou-se debaixo do toldo de uma velha loja de ferragens, fechada havia muitos anos. A noite não estava convidativa mas havia sempre quem estivesse disposto a comprar felicidade falsa e prazer duvidoso.\n\nTal como o antigo patrão que a iniciara naquela vida… Uma vida perdida ou talvez não. Doutra forma estaria, aos 36 anos, rodeada de um rancho de filhos que tinha de sustentar, um marido bêbado para aturar, o gado para tratar e as terras para amanhar.\n\nParou um carro. Saiu da cobertura, aproximou-se da janela que desceu lentamente. Entre sorrisos, disparou um costumado cumprimento:\n\n- Boa noite, sortudo…\n\n- Sortudo?\n\n- Sim! Vejo que queres companhia. E estou aqui para te ajudar…\n\nAs frases eram invariavelmente as mesmas, proferidas naquele tom meloso de provocação libidinosa. Afastou-se do carro um pouco para que a apreciasse. O condutor não gostou do que viu e sem nada dizer, arrancou.\n\nMais à frente duas jovens tiveram mais sorte e entraram na viatura.\n\nAlcina nem pestanejou. Já sabia que era assim. A sua idade trazia-lhe profundos sulcos na face, que nem as camadas de base conseguiam disfarçar.\n\nTodavia o corpo parecia menos mau, assim julgava. Vestia nessa noite uma minisaia curta que mais parecia um cinto. Um top cotado e meias de renda. Por cima, um casaco comprido de um vermelho berrante mas atractivo.\n\nRegressou ao toldo e sentou-se no degrau frio e molhado. Encostou a cabeça à parede e adormeceu. Nesse sono acabou por viajar ao seu passado, umas vezes fantástico, outras nem tanto. Parecia sentir ainda o cheiro do pão acabado de cozer e outrossim do corpo gordo e mal-cheiroso do velho que a possuíra pela primeira vez. Aquele sono levou-a de regresso à sua antiga escola, onde as letras e os números a animavam. E à mãe que desejava colocar a filha a estudar mas o pai, austero e avaro, só pretendia dinheiro.\n\nSentiu um toque muito ao de leve no ombro. Acordou sobressaltada e deu de caras com um jovem rapaz que a mirava. Perguntou:\n\n- Não achas que és muito novo para andares às meninas?\n\nO jovem voluntário olhou para os colegas ao lado e sorriu. Insistiu:\n\n- Posso ajudá-la nalguma coisa?\n\nAlcina percebendo finalmente o equívoco, respondeu:\n\n- Hum, só gostava de voltar a ser feliz!\n\nTags:400 palavrasescrita\n link do post comentar favorito\ninícioseguinte »\n5 comentários\n Anónimo  08.12.2014\nlink do comentário\nresponder\ndiscussão\nImagem de perfil\n José da Xã  08.12.2014\nObrigado Paulo.

Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Dear John,\nAs we navigate through an increasingly digital world, I wanted to share some thoughts on the dual-edged impact of technology on our business landscape.\n\nOn one hand, the rapid advancement of technology presents significant challenges that we must be prepared to face. Automation and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, streamlining processes, and enhancing productivity. However, this shift also raises concerns regarding job displacement and the potential for reduced human involvement in various roles. As certain tasks become automated, we may witness a decline in traditional job opportunities, particularly in sectors that rely heavily on routine functions.\n\nOn the other hand, this technological evolution also creates a wealth of opportunities. New fields and industries are emerging, driven by innovation and the growing demand for new skill sets. While some jobs may become obsolete, many new roles are being created in areas such as data analysis, cybersecurity, and technology management. Our ability to adapt and reskill our workforce will be crucial in harnessing these opportunities.\n\nTo thrive in this changing environment, we must remain proactive. Emphasizing continuous learning and development will not only prepare our team for the challenges ahead but also position us to take advantage of new opportunities that technology will inevitably bring.\n\nIn conclusion, while the future of technology poses certain dangers, it also holds immense potential for growth and innovation. By staying informed and adaptable, we can navigate this transition effectively, ensuring that our business remains competitive in the face of change.\n\nI look forward to discussing this further with you.\n\nBest regards,", "task_id": "7ae47a96-722c-4b2b-ad07-3716f2aef85f", "level_title": "8-Intermediate", "label": 5}

Market research from AccomData Group highlights two significant trends: a rise in weekend getaways to wellness resorts and a growing consumer focus on healthy lifestyles. Additionally, their survey shows a gap in the market—many fitness centers offer uninspiring cuisine. Zen addresses this by featuring a healthy gourmet menu designed by top chefs from renowned restaurants. The facility will include fully equipped gyms, swimming pools, and professional fitness instructors. Construction is estimated to take two years, with returns projected from the second year after opening. Annual profits are expected to reach $1 million by year five, with investors likely to recoup their initial investment within four years of opening.\n\n**Risk Assessment**\n\nEconomic fluctuations have been considered in all projections.

Alex had always been fascinated by the idea of time travel, and one day, they stumbled upon an old, dusty book in a quaint bookstore. The book contained detailed instructions on how to build a time machine. Intrigued and excited, Alex decided to give it a try. After weeks of meticulous work, Alex finally completed the time machine. With a mix of excitement and nervousness, they set the dial to the year 1920 and pressed the button. In an instant, Alex found themselves in a bustling city, surrounded by people dressed in vintage clothing. The sights, sounds, and smells were overwhelming, but Alex quickly adapted and began exploring. During their journey, Alex met a kind-hearted inventor named Thomas, who was working on a groundbreaking project. The two quickly became friends, and Thomas shared his knowledge and ideas with Alex. Together, they worked on improving the time machine, making it more efficient and reliable. As the days passed, Alex realized that they had learned invaluable lessons about perseverance, friendship, and the importance of following one's dreams. When it was time to return to the present, Alex bid farewell to Thomas and promised to keep in touch. Back in the present, Alex's life was forever changed.

[SEP] Response: When faced with complex problems or polarized debates, people often feel limited to choosing between two opposing options. However, a third way—an alternative that transcends the binary—can lead to more innovative, inclusive solutions.\n\nThe third way begins with understanding. By deeply analyzing both sides, we can extract valuable elements from each perspective while identifying the blind spots. It requires creativity and collaboration, as the solution lies not in compromise, but in reimagining the problem itself. For instance, in organizational conflicts, managers can focus on mutual goals and devise strategies that align with shared interests, rather than forcing a win-lose scenario.\n\nThis approach fosters long-term benefits. It reduces friction by addressing the core concerns of all parties, thereby creating sustainable and adaptable solutions. It is especially effective in areas like policy-making, business innovation, and interpersonal relationships. For example, in environmental debates, the third way might combine economic growth with green technology, satisfying both development and ecological preservation.\n\nUltimately, suggesting a third way demands courage to challenge conventional thinking. It requires us to step out of predefined boundaries and pioneer a path that benefits everyone involved—a hallmark of effective leadership and transformative change.", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

This influx of capital significantly boosted the Properties and Utilities sub-indices, contributing to the overall growth of the index. Looking ahead, the projections remain highly optimistic.

[SEP] Response: Leonardo DiCaprio has long positioned himself as a champion of environmental causes, using his platform to raise awareness of issues like climate change and deforestation. However, his pious posturing often rings hollow when compared to his personal lifestyle. While he endorses sustainability, he continues to travel the world in private jets and luxury yachts, burning more fossil fuels in a single trip than the average person does in a year. This glaring double standard undermines his credibility and raises questions about whether he genuinely cares about the environment or simply enjoys being seen as its savior.\nLike many media-savvy celebrities, DiCaprio knows how to nourish a belief in his own virtue, carefully curating an image of activism while still earning big bucks from high-paying Hollywood deals and partnerships. Meanwhile, ordinary people are expected to make sacrifices - cutting meat, reducing flights, and consuming less -while he continues to live extravagantly.\nSomeone needs to take him down a peg or two and remind him that real change requires action, not just well-crafted speeches. If he truly wants to emulate a model of sustainability, he should start by practicing what he preaches. Otherwise, people will begin to bad-mouth his so-called activism for what it really is - hypocrisy dressed as heroism.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Fighting broke out for control of the mineral-rich Argos Region, as well as between certain minority groups who were made refugees. There is also evidence of an attempt at ethnic cleansing of a minority group.\n\nSix months ago the military staged a coup to reunite the Federation. Although a large portion of the armed forces have returned to Federal control, elements have remained loyal to the new governments of Alpha and Beta. These armies have had small battles between themselves over disputed territories while resisting operations by the Federal forces based in Federal Territory.\n\nUntil a month ago the situation was a stalemate, however, the various factions have been rearming under the pretence of negotiations. Recently, strong leadership in Beta has resulted in a campaign that has pinned down Federal forces and Beta forces have also launched an all-out attack through Alpha territory to seize valuable land in Argos.\n\nThis has resulted in considerable civilian casualties, refugees and dislocation of population. There are reports of executions, rape, destruction of property and infrastructure.

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In Japan, robots are revolutionizing various industries and daily life. In agriculture, robots are used for planting, harvesting, and monitoring crop health, which helps address labor shortages and increases efficiency. In logistics, autonomous robots and drones are transforming warehouse operations and delivery services, ensuring faster and more accurate order fulfillment. Educational robots are being introduced in classrooms to assist teachers and engage students in interactive learning experiences. Additionally, robots are playing a significant role in disaster response, where they are deployed for search and rescue missions, hazardous material handling, and infrastructure inspection.\n\nWhile I don't have personal feelings, the societal impact of robots is complex. On the positive side, robots can enhance productivity, improve safety in dangerous tasks, and provide support in healthcare and eldercare, contributing to a higher quality of life. However, there are potential downsides, such as job displacement in certain sectors, ethical concerns regarding AI decision-making, and the need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect against hacking and misuse. It is essential to navigate these challenges thoughtfully to ensure that the benefits of robotics are maximized while mitigating any negative effects on society.", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques - metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing - I find listing to be most useful. It helps me organize my thoughts quickly and clearly, especially when I'm brainstorming or tackling a new topic. IT allows me to break down a complex topic into smaller, manageable parts, which makes the writing process feel less overwhelming. With a list, I can see all my ideas in front of me, identifying connections, and decide which points are most important or relevant. This structure helps me create a clear outline and ensures I don't miss any key details. Whether I'm writing an essay, planning  a project, or preparing for a discussion, listing serves as a reliable starting point.

[SEP] Response: Report on the Potential for Oil Extraction in the Alberta Oil Fields\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis report provides an assessment of the potential for oil extraction in Alberta’s oil sands, based on recent observations and data collected during my visit. The focus is on the costs and projected supply growth, which are crucial for evaluating the economic viability of extraction operations.\n\nFindings\n\nAlberta’s oil sands are rich in bitumen resources, which are expected to be a major source of oil extraction in the region. The operating costs for bitumen range between $6 and $14 per barrel, while synthetic crude has higher costs, ranging from $18 to $22 per barrel. The estimated supply costs for bitumen are between $14 and $24 per barrel, with synthetic crude ranging from $36 to $40 per barrel. These costs are crucial factors in determining the profitability of extraction operations. The total oil supply is projected to grow to 3.9 million barrels per day by 2015.\n\nConclusion\n\nExpansion in traditional markets is expected to occur, but further market expansion or the development of new markets will be necessary to fully capitalize on the growing oil supply.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIt is recommended to monitor the price of crude oil closely, acquire more data on extraction methods, evaluate the costs associated with transporting skilled labor to the site, and begin testing for further operational efficiency.", "task_id": "b99c403f-3a8e-4397-a157-2644d1952584", "level_title": "Oil and Gas Industry", "label": 5}

At this appointment all relevant documents must be at hand, including proof of identity, bank savings, possible bank loans proving a finance plan and any other documents the real estate agent may have asked for. In case you have to finance a part of the deal by a bank loan, of course this has to be initiated in beforehand.

What goes around comes around! Don't get angry or annoyed – get knowledge! If you can, get your manager to mentor you, but be honest about any weaknesses or things you don't know. You want to learn as much as possible. Ask questions, notice how things get done and update your skills.\n\nClose", "task_id": "6798ce8f-7a14-431e-85b6-a8403f0e32c9", "level_title": "12-Upper Intermediate", "label": 2}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Banking and Finance [SEP] Prompt: You are a journalist for a financial magazine. You've been asked by your editor to write a report on the performance of the Hang Seng (HSI) stock market index. You have some notes and a graph as your guide. Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: The Hang Seng Index (HSI) in Hong Kong has shown remarkable resilience and growth over the past six months, establishing itself as a strong contender in the global financial markets: its impressive performance can largely be attributed to significant investment inflows from Mainland China, coupled with a robust internal demand within Hong Kong.\nSix months ago, the HSI touched a low of 20,956, raising concerns among investors and analysts alike because of a big drop. However, the index has since embarked on an upward trajectory, reaching an impressive high of 27,499. This substantial rise underscores the growing confidence in the Hong Kong market, driven by the dynamic economic activities in the region.\nNotably, the Properties and Utilities Sub-indices have surged dramatically, reflecting the increased investments and expansion efforts spearheaded by Mainland Chinese enterprises. The upward trend in these sectors highlights the strategic importance of property development and utilities in sustaining economic growth.\nFinancial experts are optimistic about the future, predicting that the HSI will continue its ascent in the coming year. The anticipated growth is expected to be fueled by massive investments from other countries, bolstering market confidence and driving further expansion. Additionally, Hong Kong's robust internal demand serves as a crucial pillar, reinforcing the overall market stability.\nAs we look ahead, the Hang Seng Index stands poised to build on its recent gains, solidifying its position as a pivotal player in the global financial landscape.\n", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 5}

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is composed of several key parts, each with a specific function that ensures safe and efficient flight. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane, housing the cockpit, passengers, and cargo. It provides structural integrity and connects all other parts of the aircraft.\n\nThe wings are crucial for flight, generating lift as air flows over and under them. This lift allows the airplane to rise off the ground and stay airborne. The shape and design of the wings are essential for controlling the aircraft's stability and maneuverability.\n\nThe tail consists of the horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer helps maintain the airplane's pitch, preventing it from tipping forward or backward. The vertical stabilizer, or fin, keeps the airplane's yaw in check, preventing it from swaying side to side.\n\nFinally, the engines provide the necessary thrust to propel the airplane forward. They can be jet engines or propellers, depending on the type of aircraft. The engines' power allows the airplane to reach and maintain the desired speed and altitude.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

Survey\n\nDefinition: A quantitative research method involving structured questionnaires distributed to a large audience to collect data on opinions, behaviors, or demographics.\n\nPurpose: Used to gather standardized and measurable data that can be analyzed statistically.\n\nStrengths: Efficient for reaching a large population; provides a broad overview of trends and patterns; results are easily quantifiable.\n\nLimitations: Limited depth of insight; potential for response bias if questions are unclear or poorly designed.\n\n3. Interviews\n\nDefinition: A qualitative research method involving one-on-one conversations between a researcher and a participant to gather in-depth information.\n\nPurpose: Used to explore personal experiences, opinions, and motivations in detail.\n\nStrengths: Allows for deep exploration of topics; adaptable to individual responses; builds rapport, encouraging openness.\n\nLimitations: Time-consuming; requires skilled interviewers; prone to interviewer bias and may not represent broader populations.\n\nEach method serves different research needs, with focus groups and interviews providing rich, qualitative insights, while surveys offer a broad, quantitative overview.\n", "task_id": "cdb32f32-8025-46a7-84fd-c887feec3117", "level_title": "Research", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In the glittering world of Hollywood, few stars shine as brightly as Alex Harper. Known for his charismatic screen presence and a string of box-office hits, Alex's journey to stardom has been nothing short of meteoric. However, beneath the veneer of success lies a more complex narrative that has sparked both admiration and criticism.\n\nAlex's rise to fame began with his breakout role in the indie film \"Echoes of Silence,\" where his raw talent and emotional depth captivated audiences. Yet, as his career progressed, some critics argue that Alex has become increasingly reliant on formulaic roles in big-budget action films, sacrificing artistic integrity for commercial success. His recent performances, while financially lucrative, have been described as lacking the nuance and vulnerability that initially set him apart.\n\nMoreover, Alex's off-screen persona has not been without controversy. His outspoken views on social media have often polarized fans and critics alike. While some praise his willingness to speak out on important issues, others see his comments as impulsive and poorly thought out, detracting from his professional achievements. This duality in his public image raises questions about the responsibilities of celebrities in the digital age.\n\nDespite these criticisms, Alex's philanthropic efforts cannot be overlooked. He has used his platform to support numerous charitable causes, from environmental conservation to mental health awareness. These endeavors highlight a more compassionate side of Alex, suggesting that his impact extends beyond the silver screen.\n\nIn conclusion, Alex Harper's career is a testament to the complexities of modern celebrity. His journey reflects the delicate balance between artistic ambition and commercial reality, personal expression and public perception. As he continues to navigate the highs and lows of fame, Alex remains a figure of both admiration and scrutiny, embodying the multifaceted nature of stardom in the 21st century.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: The debate around Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a crucial one, and in my opinion, companies absolutely have a responsibility to society that extends beyond merely maximizing profits for shareholders. While some argue a company's sole duty is to its investors, this perspective feels increasingly outdated. Businesses don't operate in a vacuum; they exist within communities, utilize shared resources, and rely on a healthy society for their workforce and consumer base. This interdependency creates an ethical obligation to contribute positively to the broader good.\n\nBeyond ethical considerations, CSR makes undeniable business sense. Consumers increasingly value and reward companies with strong social and environmental records, fostering loyalty and enhancing brand reputation. Furthermore, a genuine commitment to fair employee benefits and sustainable operations often leads to higher productivity, lower turnover, and a more engaged workforce. While some might view CSR spending as a mere marketing tactic, truly integrated efforts build long-term value and resilience, far surpassing any fleeting PR gains.\n\nUltimately, while governments certainly set regulations, responsible companies go beyond minimum compliance, proactively addressing societal challenges. Integrating social and environmental responsibility into core operations isn't just about doing good; it's about building a more reputable, sustainable, and ultimately more profitable future for all stakeholders involved.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

As a result, they can pose risks to consumers.\n\nAccording to experts, when you use counterfeit glasses (glasses that do not have a guarantee of UV protection), you are taking away your eyes' natural protection against excess light. This means that more light enters, which can cause several vision problems.\n\nCounterfeit glasses can also cause allergies, due to the fact that they are made with poor quality materials.\n\nThe sale of counterfeit glasses has been increasingly damaging not only the optical sector, but also the entire legal market.

You can create any facts about your city that will support your proposal. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi Josh and Ken,\n\nThanks for the detailed summary and thoughts—Ken, I really appreciate how clearly you’ve laid out the two directions we’ve been considering. It’s clear we’re at a turning point, and we need to be strategic about our next move.\n\nI’d like to propose a third option that combines the strengths of both ideas: a hybrid model that leverages a smaller showroom in a growing, more affordable district, coupled with a mobile and online presence.\n\nI’ve been researching locations and think the East Park District in Centerville could be ideal. It’s about 15 minutes from downtown, and commercial rents there are currently averaging around $2,200/month—less than half of what we’d pay if we stay. East Park is undergoing a wave of development, with new residential buildings and co-working spaces attracting a younger, professional crowd.\n\nHere’s what I’m thinking:\n\n\t•\tWe open a compact, stylish showroom in East Park, where customers can still come in to see fabrics, discuss their needs, and get measured. We don’t need the same size or setup as now—just enough to maintain our in-person, high-touch service.\n\n\t•\tWe expand our digital platform with a revamped website, offering virtual consultations and self-service measurement tools.\n\n\t•\tWe continue the mobile measurement model, especially for corporate clients, allowing us to meet them at their offices, which many will appreciate for convenience.\nPros:\n\n\t•\tWe retain a physical presence to preserve our brand identity and client relationships.\n\n\t•\tWe dramatically reduce overhead.\n\n\t•\tWe position ourselves in a growing neighborhood with long-term potential.\n\n\t•\tWe modernize and diversify our customer engagement.\nCons:\n\n\t•\tWe’d still lose the central downtown foot traffic.\n\n\t•\tThere’s an initial investment required to build the website and rebrand slightly.\n\nI think this strikes a balance between stability and innovation. If it sounds promising, I’d love to meet up and work out the numbers together or even take a quick trip to East Park to scout locations.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\nBest, ", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: Aviation [SEP] Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Fuselage\nThe plane’s body, or fuselage, holds the aircraft together, with pilots sitting at the front of the fuselage, passengers and cargo in the back.\n\nCockpit\n\n\nThe cockpit is the area at the front of the fuselage from which a pilot operates the plane. The cockpit contains the:\n\nInstrument panel\n\nThis is similar to a car’s dashboard, providing the pilot with information about the flight, the engine and the circumstances of the aircraft. Depending on the aviation electronics (avionics) installed in an aircraft this may be on an interactive screen or using the typical ‘6 Pack’ for key pieces of information.\nFlight controls\n\nIn the cockpit are two seats, one for the pilot and the other for the co-pilot.\nPilot seats\n\nIn the cockpit are two seats, one for the pilot and the other for the co-pilot.\nRudder pedals\n\nRudder pedals control yaw in flight and are used for steering on the ground during a taxi.\nOverhead panel\n\nThe overhead panel contains aircraft systems, such as air conditioning, electrical, fuel and hydraulics.\nSide consoles\n\nSide consoles are for communication instruments and documentation, depending on the aircraft.\n \n\nEach of these parts of an airplane are critical in the different phases of flight.\n\nWings\n\n\nAn aircraft’s wings are critical to flight through the production of lift, but they have many parts of the wing to control this lift amount and direction.\n\nAilerons\n\nAilerons are one of the three primary control surfaces that control a plane (along with the Elevator and Rudder) and are located on the trailing edge of the wing to help control the roll of a plane. When a pilot turns to the left in the cockpit, the left aileron goes up, reducing lift on that side, and the right aileron goes down, increasing lift causing that side to rise. This causes the plane to roll to the left and begin a turn.\nFlaps\n\nFlaps, like ailerons, are located on the trailing edge of the wing. Unlike ailerons, the flaps move symmetrically on each side and create more lift and drag. Flaps are typically used during takeoff and landing, when aircraft speeds are lower, to create additional lift and reduce stall speeds.\nWinglet\n\nOn an airliner, the tip of the wing is bent up. This is known as a winglet. Winglets were created to reduce induced drag.\nSlats\n\nSlats are similar to flaps, only located at the front of the wing (a leading-edge device) and change a wing’s shape temporarily to increase lift.\nSpoilers\n\nSpoilers are used to help the aircraft descend and reduces the lift component of an airfoil. This allows the plane to descend and lose altitude without gaining airspeed.\nTail (Empennage)\n\n\nAn aircraft’s tail is mainly used for stability, as well as creating lift in combination with the wings. It’s comprised of several parts.\n\nHorizontal Stabilizer and Elevator\n\nThe horizontal stabilizer keeps the airplane’s nose from moving up and down (pitch). The hinged part on the horizontal stabilizer is the elevator and is one of the primary flight controls. When the pilot in the cockpit pulls back on the yoke, the elevators go up, causing more force to push down on the tail, lifting up the nose of the aircraft. Raising the nose changes the angle of attack on the wings, increasing lift.\nVertical Stabilizer and Rudder\n\nThe vertical stabilizer allows the airplane to weathervane into the relative wind. This helps prevent the side-to-side motion of the aircraft’s nose (yaw). The rudder, which is the primary flight control on the trailing edge of the vertical stabilizer, is controlled in the cockpit by the pilot using the left and right pedals. When the pilot pushes the left pedal, the rudder deflects to the left, pushing the tail right and the nose to yaw left. Using the rudder in combination with the ailerons causes coordinated turns by the aircraft.\n \n\nThe tail and its various parts are essential to the aircraft, helping to keep the plane on course.\n\nEngine(s)\n\n\nThe engine(s), or powerplant, of an aircraft creates thrust needed for the plane to fly. Generally speaking, there are two types of aircraft engines, reciprocating and turbine. With reciprocating engines, air flows into the engine, is compressed and mixed with fuel and an electric spark to combust, with exhaust gases leaving the back of the engine through the manifold. The engine spins the propeller which then creates thrust to move the plane forward. Alternatively, with a turbine engine, the action of compressing air, mixing with fuel, ignition and exhaust are similar but occur inline. In this case the power is generated by the air being exhausted from the engine.\n\nPropeller\n\n\nAn aircraft’s propeller(s) are airfoils, similar to a wing, installed vertically to create thrust to drive the plane forward. Attached to the engine, they spin quickly, creating lift from the pressure difference they create, only instead of this lift causing the plane to move upwards, it drives the plane forward creating thrust. This thrust and forward motion in turn causes air to pass over the wings, creating the vertical lift.\n\nLanding Gear\n\n\nLanding gear is located under the belly of the plane consisting of a wheel and strut to soften impact with the ground and may be retractable into the fuselage. Tricycle type wheels are common for general aviation with one wheel at the front and two behind or the reverse for tailwheels with two wheels at the front of the plane and one under the tail.\n\nAll parts of an airplane are crucial for conducting safe flight. A huge responsibility pilots take on is making sure all aircraft components are in excellent condition before embarking on their flight journey.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

Be sure to polish your work before you submit it. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: My Favorite City: New York City vs. My Hometown\n\nNew York City is a place full of life, diversity, and endless possibilities. The bustling streets, towering skyscrapers, and vibrant neighborhoods create an atmosphere that is electric and inspiring. Every corner of New York offers something new, whether it’s a pop-up art exhibit, a world-class restaurant, or a historic landmark. Public transportation makes it easy to explore the entire city, and the opportunities for career growth are unmatched. The energy of New York constantly pushes people to dream bigger and work harder.\n\nIn contrast, my hometown is much quieter and slower-paced. Nestled in a small valley, it is surrounded by nature, offering beautiful hiking trails and peaceful parks. Life moves at a gentle rhythm, and everyone seems to know each other. While it lacks the excitement and variety of New York, my hometown offers a strong sense of community and a deep connection to nature. Living there feels safe, calm, and rooted.\n\nWhile I love visiting my hometown for its tranquility, New York City remains my favorite place because of its endless excitement and opportunities.\n", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a criticism of a celebrity. It can be a particular celebrity or the whole idea of celebrity in general. Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Gerry Scotti is undeniably a beloved figure in Italian television, known for his charm, humor, and long-standing career as a host of popular game shows like Chi Vuol Essere Milionario?. His approachable persona has endeared him to millions of viewers. However, like many high-profile figures, his career is not without its criticisms.One of the primary critiques of Scotti is that he has become overly reliant on the same type of format and role. After decades in the industry, much of his work centers around light entertainment, particularly quiz shows and talent competitions. While these programs have enjoyed significant success, his continued focus on the same type of content has led some critics to question whether he is simply coasting on his past achievements rather than evolving or taking creative risks. This lack of variety may limit his potential, and some argue that his talents could be better utilized in more ambitious or innovative projects.\nAnother point of contention is his larger-than-life, occasionally domineering presence on screen. Though his jovial nature is usually a strength, there are instances where Scotti's behavior has been seen as overly indulgent or controlling, sometimes overshadowing the contestants or co-hosts he shares the stage with.  While he remains popular among older viewers, he risks alienating a broader audience if he doesn't adapt to the changing social climate.\nIn conclusion, while Gerry Scotti remains a master of light entertainment and is undoubtedly a cornerstone of Italian television, he might benefit from diversifying his projects and demonstrating more openness to change, both in his professional roles and in his engagement with contemporary social issues. By doing so, he could ensure that his legacy continues to grow and resonate with a wider and more diverse audience.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: I am from Brazil, and that is important in shaping my opinion, because, besides being Brazilian, I am also a lawyer.\nSo, here, the legislation about companies and enterprises have the \"Social Function\", what means that here, we don't have a discuss, cause the answer is Yes. \nTalking about the Function Social and the responsability below that, it coul be defined by what companies have to care about your own structure, as well, its have to take about people, and not just employees,  but society in general.\nIt means that companies have impacts on the enviroment where they operate. So the companies have to work for make this impact be more positive than negative.\nFor example, here, we have legal prevision to requires that companies hire a percentage of people with a disabilities, also we have quotas to hire young people as \"Menor e Jovem Aprendiz\" (Young apprentices) to promote and helps the inclusion of vulnerable people in job market, which provide professional opportunities.\nIn conclusion, from my perspective as a Brazilian and a lawyer, I believe that companies cannot separate business success from social responsibility. In Brazil, this idea is part of our legal framework and reflects how we see the role of organizations in society.

[SEP] Response: Facing the blank page is sometimes a torment so great that it would make climbing the Himalayas seem like a Sunday stroll; it's a hardly exaggerated hyperbole to describe the initial fear. The cursor blinks, like a mocking eye in the symbolism of the void to be filled. My mind is a chaotic field where ideas collide; to cope, I sometimes launch into free writing, letting everything flow unfiltered, an uninterrupted torrent of words. Then, an idea catches my attention, a spark that I decide to explore precisely. This is targeted free writing, like a laser beam on a precise point. I turn around this point, I come back to my sentences, I go deeper, it's the movement of the loop digging its furrow. I list the facets of the subject: its causes, its consequences, its actors, its colors, its sounds. I ask myself questions: Why is this important? Who am I writing for? What's missing? How does this subject connect with others? I try to see it from six different angles, like a mental cubage: describe it, compare it, associate it, analyze it, apply it, argue for or against it. In the middle of this process, a phrase emerges, simple but evocative: “The idea is the seed, the writing the gardener”, a metaphor that sums it all up.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

I was walking home from the store, minding my own business, when I saw a squirrel staring at me from a tree branch. Nothing unusual, right? Well, the little guy suddenly jumped onto my backpack and just hung on for dear life!  \n\nI panicked and started spinning in circles, trying to shake it off, but the squirrel wasn’t letting go. People passing by stopped and just stared at me like I was performing some weird dance ritual. One lady even pulled out her phone—I’m probably on the internet somewhere now!  \n\nFinally, after what felt like forever (but was probably 20 seconds), the squirrel leaped off and ran up another tree. I stood there, completely stunned, before bursting into laughter. I still have no idea why it thought my backpack was a good place to land, but it definitely made my day way more interesting.  \n\nAnyway, how’s life with you? Hope your week has been less… squirrelly!  \n\nTalk soon,  \nSarika Bharti", "task_id": "52a760cd-9898-4cce-bb43-c490923b2b45", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Robots are becoming increasingly common in various industries in my country. In manufacturing, automated robotic arms are used for assembly lines, ensuring precision and efficiency. In the medical field, robotic-assisted surgery is improving patient outcomes, allowing for minimally invasive procedures. Additionally, delivery robots and drones are being tested in urban areas to enhance logistics and reduce traffic congestion. While these advancements are impressive, they also bring challenges. On the positive side, robots can handle dangerous tasks, reducing workplace injuries, and increase productivity. However, automation may lead to job displacement, particularly in industries that rely on manual labor. Moreover, as robots become more integrated into daily life, ethical concerns about privacy and security arise. Despite these concerns, I believe that when used responsibly, robots can greatly benefit society by improving efficiency and safety. The key is to find a balance that allows humans and robots to coexist in a way that maximizes their potential while minimizing negative impacts.", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Please pay attention to a few important requirements for the event:\n\n-   It should be safe – not everyone on the team is a thrill-seeker and we want all staff to feel at ease.\n-   It should include activities that build team spirit – we want to get everyone working together and feeling good about themselves and each other.\n-   It must fit our budget – skydiving, for example, might be a bit too expensive.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\nBest,\n\nLindsay Bingham, HR Assistant", "task_id": "5949887a-c75f-46ad-95d6-9775e932a1e6", "level_title": "14-Advanced", "label": 0}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Law [SEP] Prompt: Review your notes and write a case report stating who was found guilty and why. Briefly comment on whether you found the verdict appropriate. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In the tort action case for trespassing, Medina was found guilty of unlawfully entering the Byron family’s home. The plaintiff, the Byron family, reported being distressed and terrorized by Medina’s intrusion. Although there was no clear mention of any valuables taken, the act of breaking into the home itself caused significant emotional harm to the family.\n\nMedina, the defendant, argued that he believed the house was empty and that he was seeking shelter during the night because he was scared. Despite this explanation, the court determined that Medina’s actions constituted trespassing, a criminal offense. The verdict imposed a fine of 1,000, to be paid in two installments, along with 300 hours of community service.\n\nI find the verdict appropriate because, even if Medina’s intentions were not to harm or steal, entering someone’s private property without permission is illegal and can cause emotional distress. The sentence balances punishment with an opportunity for Medina to give back to the community, reflecting both justice and fairness. This case highlights the importance of respecting private property rights and the consequences of violating them.\n", "task_id": "bb0d114c-9550-4f27-9138-b2eb14c39437", "level_title": "Law", "label": 5}

They are being used from trivial to most important parts in the hotel industry. For example, they are being used to greet the guests that arrive at the hotel to serving the food in restaurant to the customers. One of the downside of using the robots in Hotel industry is there have been lay offs of many existing employees in order to reduce the costs of operation in hotel industry.  There are many affected by the introduction of robots in hotel industry as well. On the other hand the positive side of using robots in hotel industry is there is less investment required for the employee costs which could be used for acquiring robots. Unlike humans, robots provide 24 hours 7 days a week service without any burn off time or unproductive time. This helps in achieving efficiency and productivity. In my humble opinion, the use of robots is favorable from business point of view but it is unfavorable from  human point of view.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, metaphor and symbolism stand out as particularly useful to me. Metaphors allow for vivid and imaginative comparisons, making abstract concepts more relatable and engaging. For instance, describing time as a \"thief\" can evoke a strong emotional response and convey the fleeting nature of moments. This technique enriches writing by adding layers of meaning and enhancing the reader's experience.\n\nSymbolism, on the other hand, imbues objects, characters, or events with deeper significance, often reflecting broader themes. This technique can subtly guide the reader to uncover hidden messages and insights within the text. For example, using a storm to symbolize turmoil or a rose to represent love can create powerful imagery and resonance.\n\nFocused free writing is another valuable technique, as it encourages the flow of ideas without the constraints of structure or perfection. This method can help overcome writer's block and generate raw, authentic content that can later be refined.\n\nOverall, these techniques—metaphor, symbolism, and focused free writing—are instrumental in crafting compelling narratives that captivate and provoke thought, making them indispensable tools in my writing arsenal.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

This achievement underscores the continued trust Crum has in our ability to deliver value.

This allows us to address issues quickly and proactively, reducing the likelihood of unresolved defects.\n\nImproved Quality Assurance Processes: We have enhanced our Quality Assurance (QA) procedures, including more thorough testing and better pre-release checks.

[SEP] Response: Dying your hair blue may seem like an attractive and bold choice for many people, but there are several reasons why it might not be the best decision for everyone. First, color maintenance is an important factor to consider. Blue tones tend to fade quickly, requiring frequent touch-ups and can be expensive and time-consuming.\n\nFurthermore, the process of dyeing hair blue usually involves pre-treatment with bleach, especially if your hair is dark. Bleaching can damage the hair structure, leaving it dry and brittle, and increasing the risk of split ends.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is the impact on professional or educational settings. In some contexts, unconventional hair colors may not be well received and could influence others' perceptions of us, affecting potential job opportunities or interpersonal relationships.", "task_id": "c230af5f-0ba4-4f12-b80c-26facbe2da6d", "level_title": "Office", "label": 0}

This amphibious creature, often depicted with a turtle-like shell, a beak, and webbed hands and feet, dwells in rivers and ponds. A distinctive feature is its \"sara,\" a bald depression on its head filled with water, the source of its power.\n\nKappa are known for their love of cucumbers and their penchant for playing pranks, ranging from harmless mischief to more sinister deeds like drowning unsuspecting victims. Their strength, despite their small stature, is formidable. However, they are bound by etiquette. If one bows deeply to a Kappa, it will reciprocate, spilling the water from its sara and losing its power. This vulnerability, combined with their affinity for politeness, makes them a fascinating blend of danger and vulnerability.\n\nWhile often portrayed as malevolent, some stories depict Kappa as guardians of waterways or even as creatures that can be befriended. Their enduring popularity reflects the complex relationship between humans and the natural world in Japanese culture, where respect for nature's power is paramount.\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a trade pact signed in 1992 by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It aimed to eliminate most tariffs and trade barriers on goods, products and services exchanged between these countries. NAFTA came into effect on January 1, 1994, creating one of the world's largest free trade zones. The agreement facilitated increased trade and investment, contributing to economic growth in the member countries. However, it also faced criticism for its impact on employment and the environment. In 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Supporters of NAFTA estimate that around 14 million jobs rely on trade with Canada and Mexico, with nearly 200,000 export-related jobs created annually. However, critics argue that NAFTA is to blame for job losses and wage stagnation in the United States, as it led to outsourcing and the relocation of manufacturing jobs to Mexico.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 4}

Write 100 - 150 words. [SEP] Response: Flight 123 from New York to Los Angeles encountered unexpected turbulence shortly after reaching cruising altitude. The sudden and severe turbulence caused a few minor injuries to passengers and flight attendants, and some loose items shifted around the cabin. As a precautionary measure, the captain decided to descend to a lower altitude to avoid further turbulence. The flight was delayed by approximately 30 minutes due to this incident. Upon reaching a more stable altitude, the cabin crew quickly assessed the situation and provided medical attention to those who were injured. After ensuring everyone was safe and comfortable, the flight continued as normal.

Following this acquisition, The U.S. Operation was known as Cap Gemini DASD.[7]\n\nIn 1990 Cap Gemini Sogeti acquired the Hoskyns Group, a major IT outsourcing and managed services company in the UK.[8]\n\nIn 1996, the name was simplified to Cap Gemini, and the firm launched a new group logo. All operating companies worldwide were re-branded to operate as Cap Gemini.[6]\n\nErnst & Young Consulting was acquired by Cap Gemini in 2000. It simultaneously integrated Gemini Consulting to form Cap Gemini Ernst & Young.[9] In 2017, Cap Gemini S.A. became Capgemini SE, and its Euronext ticker name similarly changed from CAP GEMINI to CAPGEMINI.[10]\n\nIn 2018, they acquired the Philadelphia-based digital customer engagement company LiquidHub for US$500 million to assist Capgemini's digital and cloud growth in North America.

He is associated with Capgemini for more than 20 years.[26] From 2005 to 2007, Aiman was Capgemini's Deputy Director of Strategy.[27] In November 2007, Ezzat was appointed COO of the Financial Services Global Business Unit, and became its Global Head in December 2008 till 2012. From January 2018 to May 2020, he served as Chief Operating Officer and prior to this as Chief Financial Officer, from December 2012 to 2018.[28][29]\n\nFrom 2012 to 2020, Paul Hermelin served as the Group Chairman and CEO. He joined Capgemini in 1993, and was appointed as its CEO in 2002.[30] In May 2012, Hermelin became chairman and CEO of the Capgemini Group.[31] He succeeded Serge Kampf, who served as the Vice Chairman of the Board until his death on 15 March 2016.[32]\n\nIn May 2020, Aiman Ezzat succeeded Paul Hermelin as CEO. Paul Hermelin continues as chairman of the board of directors.[33][34]\n\nCapgemini and the public sector in France\nIn December 2022, the consulting firm McKinsey & Company was alleged, amongst other accusations, to have benefitted in France from special access and favorable government treatment, including the awarding of lucrative government contracts. The French media dubbed the scandal the \"McKinsey Affair\". Subsequently, a French Senate Committee of Inquiry investigated the growing influence of private consulting firms on public policy.\n\nIn February 2022 Senator Éliane Assassi questioned each consulting firm on their activities on specific projects. She raised in particular the case of a former employee of the Capgemini group, who had been appointed as head of the Elysée correspondence service. The service subsequently contracted Capgemini to reorganize its digital tools, with the aim of setting up a system to automate mail reading to produce reports. \"Is it not embarrassing, from your point of view, that a former employee of Capgemini is responsible for reviewing the correspondence service of the Élysée?\", the senator asked. \"It is not up to us to have an opinion on who, within the client organization, triggers this type of service\", replied Mathieu Dougados, executive director, and he suggested the commission ask the Élysée.\n\nEtienne Grass, director of public sector activities at Capgemini commented \"In principle, our employees are not intended to be recruited\", and for good reason: \"when it happens, it puts us in a complex situation\", he admitted. However, the firm makes an exception vis-à-vis the State, by not applying certain contractual clauses which prevent an employee from joining a client, \"provided that an ethical framework has been fixed\", the director underlined.[35]\n\nIn June 2022, Le Monde published a survey of the significant lucrative projects carried out by Capgemini for the French public sector entitled \"Consulting firms: Capgemini, the expensive service provider that the State can no longer do without\". The name of Etienne Grass, head of the \"public sector\" market unit of Capgemini Invent since 2017, was mentioned.", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 0}

Participants were asked for their opinions on the collarless dress shirt, including their likelihood to purchase it and reasons for approval or disapproval.\n\nFindings\nIn Rio de Janeiro, only 35% approved of the shirt, and 20% would purchase it, while 65% disapproved. In Shanghai, approval was much higher at 80%, with 40% willing to purchase. The dissatisfaction stemmed from issues with design, size, color, and material. Feedback also highlighted inadequate market research and lack of diversity in product design.\n\nConclusions\nThe product performed significantly better in Shanghai than in Rio de Janeiro. While Shanghai respondents expressed moderate satisfaction, results in Rio indicate a need for major improvements in product appeal to meet market expectations.\n\nRecommendations\n\t•\tConduct more targeted research on men’s preferences.\n\t•\tImprove design details, such as stitching color.\n\t•\tOffer slim-fit sizing and prioritize black, white, and strong primary colors.\n\t•\tUse wrinkle-free, sweat-absorbent materials.\n\t•\tFocus on improving the Rio de Janeiro market as a priority.", "task_id": "c4a6991e-c330-41bd-88de-31bb25ee4bf1", "level_title": "Correspondence", "label": 5}

It also served in eliminating or reducing custom duties among members.Some of the profound effects on the trade between the members is on agriculture where the fruits and vegetables from Mexico flow into US. The US trade deficit with Mexico and Canada was eliminated. There were certain disadvantages to this agreement as well which the member states have to face.

Armed with nothing but his camera and a sense of curiosity, Arjun set off early in the morning, hoping to capture some stunning landscapes.\n\nAs he drove through winding roads and picturesque villages, he stumbled upon an old, abandoned mansion hidden behind a dense grove of trees.

The mansion, though dilapidated, had an eerie charm that beckoned him inside.\n\nTo his surprise, Arjun discovered a hidden room filled with antique furniture, dusty books, and a mysterious locked chest. After some effort, he managed to open the chest and found a collection of vintage photographs and letters dating back to the early 1900s. The letters revealed a long-lost love story between the mansion's original owners, adding a touch of romance to his adventure.\n\nArjun spent the rest of the day documenting his findings and imagining the lives of the people who once lived there.

You can create any facts about your city that will support your proposal. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: We really have to make a decision about our business. Our landlord just wrote me another letter about the rent. Next month, it will be raised 25% to $4,500 per month. That's going to eat even more into our profits. I mean, Josh, that's $54,000 a year!\n\nI'm going to summarize our discussions here. I know that you are strongly in favor of just staying where we are and paying the higher rent. The obvious disadvantages of that are that our sales of clothing are increasing more slowly than our expenses AND with the rapid growth in Centerville, we can expect further rent increases in the coming months. The big pro for staying is that we're in a fashionable district where long-term customers know us. We're right downtown, so customers can come in on their lunch breaks to be measured for a suit or other high-end clothing.\n\nYou know that I favor going to a completely different model. We move to the south end of town for making the clothes, but create a system where we meet people in their offices or schools to measure them for new clothes. We also open up a much better webpage than what we have now so that customers can view our clothing options and enter their measurements. Incredible cost savings! The con of that is that we lose the showroom, where customers can just come in and look at the possibilities, feel the cloth and talk to us about what would be appropriate for them. Far less personalized service, which has helped us build close relationships with our customers.\n\nHonestly, I'd like another option, but I'm out of ideas. Should we talk to more people? I'm up for anything, but we really DO need to make a decision!", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: We are very pleased with the opportunity to deepen our partnership with Westpac and believe our proposal provides the most comprehensive approach for Westpac to execute its strategy successfully.  This initiative is critical for Westpac to differentiate its service delivery model in the midst of an industry shift towards growing customer share.  Westpac lags behind its key competitors and the risk of further customer attrition will result in a systemic deterioration of profitability.            \nWestpac and Verint have formed a shared perspective on the importance of operational improvements to the bank’s overall transformation.  Our diagnostic work earlier this year suggests that a successful transformation program can free up at least 2,000 personnel for frontline sales roles over the next 12-24 months.  Assuming current levels of Westpac sales productivity, migration of 2,000 personnel to the frontline could add $156 million in annual revenues.  \nAs important, a successful redesign of existing operating processes will allow the bank to substantially improve turnaround times for customers and free up time consuming tasks carried out by frontline staff.  We therefore view operations transformation not simply as gaining efficiencies in back office processes, but as a strategic catalyst to lower cost, reduce frontline work, improve customer service, and increase the bank’s capabilities as if offers more complex products and services to market.  As such, operations transformation is an integral part of Westpac’s customer centric strategy that must be executed in full alignment with the bank’s new strategic direction\n", "task_id": "30d1e722-4061-4790-ae33-52000cd6533c", "level_title": "6-Elementary", "label": 0}

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Cubing is a very interesting technique. It’s called cubing because it allows you to look at a topic from six sides, like a cube. It’s recommended that you spend 3-5 minutes exploring each of the ‘sides.’ First you describe it: what’s it look like? Then you compare it: what’s it similar or different to? Next, you analyze it: what’s it made of? Then you associate it: what does it remind you of? After that, you apply it: what can you do with it or use it for? And finally, argue it: take either side, and defend or attack it. This is an excellent strategy to use when you’re trying to decide how to tackle a topic at the outset, or should your ideas dry up and you come to a sudden stop.\n\nMind-mapping, webbing or clustering, as they are really one and the same thing. Some people also call this technique diagramming!

That's why no one has ever seen him.\n\nIn Portugal, we have many songs (lullabies) and popular poems about João Pestana. To my grandmother, a big thank you for having brought them to me.

[SEP] Response: Tips for Motivating (and Not Demotivating) Team\n\nHi Team,\n\nHere are some helpful reminders for building a motivated, engaged, and productive work environment — plus a few things to avoid along the way.Ways to Motivate Your Employees:\nIncentivize Performance\nShow your team that the company's success is their success. When people know there's a reward or recognition involved, they’re naturally more driven.\n\nSupport Career Growth\nTake genuine interest in employees’ career paths. Offer mentorship, training, and opportunities to grow.\n\nPromote Work-Life Balance\nRespect the fact that everyone has responsibilities outside work. A healthy balance leads to happier, more focused employees.\n\nListen Actively\nCreate space for employees to voice concerns or ideas. Feeling heard = feeling valued.\n\nModel Respectful Leadership\nTreat your team the way you’d want to be treated — with respect, trust, and encouragement.\n\nWays to Demotivate Your Team:\nDisrespecting Subordinates\nPosition or title shouldn’t override basic human respect.\n\nTaking Credit for Others’ Work\nAlways acknowledge contributions — it builds trust and morale.\n\nLosing Your Temper\nStay composed. A reactive leader creates fear, not loyalty.\n\nShifting Blame\nLeaders protect their team and share responsibility, even in tough situations.\n\nForgetting to Praise Good Work\nA simple “great job” goes a long way.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning English as a second language presents several challenges for students. One of the primary issues is pronunciation. English has many sounds that do not exist in other languages, making it difficult for learners to produce them accurately. Additionally, spelling and grammar can be confusing due to numerous exceptions to rules and irregular verb forms.\n\nAnother significant challenge is vocabulary acquisition. English has a vast lexicon, and words often have multiple meanings depending on context. This can be overwhelming for learners trying to build their vocabulary. Listening comprehension is also a hurdle, as native speakers often speak quickly and use idiomatic expressions that are not easily understood by non-native speakers.\n\nCultural differences can further complicate language learning. Understanding the cultural context in which the language is used is crucial for effective communication. Lastly, confidence plays a vital role. Many students fear making mistakes and feel self-conscious when speaking, which can hinder their progress.\n\nDespite these challenges, with consistent practice and exposure, students can overcome these obstacles and achieve proficiency in English. Supportive learning environments and access to resources like language apps, online courses, and conversation partners can significantly aid in this journey.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

He is known as the guardian of the forests and their animals, protecting them from hunters and anyone who tries to harm nature. His most striking characteristic is his feet, which are turned backward, serving to confuse those who pursue him by leaving tracks that lead in the opposite direction of his actual movement. The legend describes Curupira as a short being with red or fiery hair, who moves with great agility through the forest. He uses whistles and shouts to frighten and disorient invaders, guiding them away from his territory. Those who disrespect the forest or hunt predatorily are targets of his tricks and punishments. The story of Curupira is an important element of Brazilian popular culture, conveying values of respect and environmental preservation. His presence in the popular imagination reinforces the importance of harmony between humans and nature, serving as a constant reminder of the need to protect Brazil's natural resources.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

They enter the data into the system which is thereafter reviewed by external specialists and then based on all supporting documents, it is decided if the loan is approved or not. Thereafter, once the loan gets approved, based on the tax returns, the sanction amount is decided.

Some factors that kept them from feeling strongly satisfied:\n\nBefore launching, not enough market research carried out\n\nGood idea, bad execution\n\nGeneral feeling is that diversity was not considered in product design\n\nMoving forward, this is what we should consider:\n\nMore research: what men want and need in an accessory\n\nDesign: more attention to detail, e.g. stitching color\n\nSize: slim fitting\n\nColors: strong primary colors; black and white\n\nMaterial: wrinkle-free and/or sweat absorbent\n\nChanges for Rio are a priority, because Asia results are satisfactory\n\nClose", "task_id": "c4a6991e-c330-41bd-88de-31bb25ee4bf1", "level_title": "Correspondence", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: The writing techniques introduced in the preceding units have been invaluable in enhancing my writing skills.

Listing, on the other hand, helps me to generate and organize ideas, ensuring that my writing is clear and cohesive.\nThese techniques complement each other well, and I often find myself using them in conjunction.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The idea of celebrity culture has both positive and negative aspects, but its drawbacks often outweigh its benefits. Many celebrities achieve fame not because of their talent or hard work but due to social media hype, controversies, or mere luck. This creates unrealistic role models who influence society in questionable ways.\n\nOne major issue is the obsession with celebrities’ personal lives. The media constantly invades their privacy, and fans blindly follow every detail, often ignoring more important social issues. This idolization also promotes unhealthy beauty standards, as many celebrities undergo cosmetic procedures or excessive editing to maintain an unrealistic image. As a result, fans feel pressured to conform to these unattainable ideals.\n\nFurthermore, some celebrities misuse their influence by spreading misinformation, engaging in scandals, or endorsing harmful products solely for profit. Despite their wealth and power, many fail to use their platform responsibly. Instead of focusing on meaningful contributions, they often prioritize personal gain over positive societal impact.\n\nUltimately, while some celebrities do use their fame for good, the culture surrounding celebrity worship is largely problematic and distracts society from more significant matters.\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Not just faded into the night sky—completely gone, as if it had been snatched by an invisible hand.\n\nStartled but curious, Mia lit another lantern. This one drifted upwards, but halfway to the clouds, it flickered out and disappeared too. By the time the third lantern vanished, Mia was convinced something eerie was going on.\n\nWhen she mentioned it to her neighbor, they told her about the legend of \"The Whispering Wind,\" a local tale of a spirit that guards the skies above the lake. It’s said to collect lanterns as offerings to light its realm.\n\nMia isn’t one to believe in ghosts, but she admits there was something oddly magical about that night. She’s already planning another visit—this time, with more lanterns.\n\nWhat would you do if the sky itself seemed alive?", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between language skills and behavioural problems and the potential moderating role of the quality of classroom emotional support in this relationship among 242 preschool children from low-income families. The Preschool Language Scale-5 was administered individually to each child. The quality of classroom emotional support was measured using the Emotional Support domain of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System for Pre-Kindergarten. Teachers and parents completed the Child Behaviour Checklist for Ages 1½-5. Results indicated the inverse relationship between language skills and behaviour problems varied by the level of classroom emotional support provided by teachers. Specifically, children with lower language skills exhibited higher levels of behaviour problems in classrooms where teachers provided lower levels of emotional support. Findings from this study have important implications for enhancing teachers’ emotional support aimed at children with lower language skills and for future research.\n\nKeywords: language, classroom emotional support, behaviour problems, preschool, low income\n\nIntroduction\nResearch has identified links between language skills and behavioural outcomes in children (Bornstein, Hahn, & Suwalsky, 2013; Chow & Wehby, 2018; Petersen et al., 2013).

The estimated supply costs are between \\$14 and \\$24 per barrel for bitumen and \\$36 to \\$40 per barrel for synthetic crude. Total oil supply is expected to grow to 3.9 million barrels per day by 2015, indicating a significant increase in production capabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWith expansion in traditional markets, Alberta's oil fields are expected to meet growing demand. However, new markets or additional market expansion will be required to fully capitalize on the region’s potential.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nIt is crucial to monitor the price of crude oil, acquire further data on the oil fields, assess the costs of transporting skilled labor to the area, and begin initial testing to determine the best extraction methods.\n", "task_id": "b99c403f-3a8e-4397-a157-2644d1952584", "level_title": "Oil and Gas Industry", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Although I admire talent and dedication, I feel compelled to criticize the idea of celebrity culture in general, especially how it often promotes superficial values over genuine substance. To begin with, one major criticism is that many celebrities are celebrated more for their appearance and curated lifestyles than for any meaningful contribution to society. While it’s true that some use their fame to raise awareness for important causes, it’s disappointing that the media still tends to reward scandal and controversy instead of integrity and hard work. Another point worth mentioning is that celebrity culture fuels unrealistic expectations, particularly for young people. It encourages people to compare themselves constantly, which can lead to low self-esteem and even mental health issues. I’m not saying that all celebrities are to blame, but the system as a whole is problematic. It would be better if we shifted our focus from idolizing people for their wealth or status to valuing those who make a real difference in their communities. In short, the obsession with celebrities is, in my opinion, rather unhealthy. It would be more beneficial for society if we celebrated kindness, creativity, and authenticity instead of fame for fame’s sake.\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Garuda, a divine eagle-like being and the eternal enemy of the serpent race, the Nagas. Garuda is most famously known as the mighty mount (vahana) of Lord Vishnu, one of the principal deities in Hinduism. Described as having the golden body of a strong man with a white face, red wings, and a beak like that of a hawk, Garuda is a symbol of strength, courage, and unwavering devotion.\nAccording to legend, Garuda was born to Vinata, one of the wives of the sage Kashyapa. His birth was so powerful that it shook the heavens. He once undertook a dangerous mission to retrieve the elixir of immortality, amrita, to free his mother from slavery. With immense speed and valor, he defeated gods and demons alike, showing both his physical might and noble character.\nGaruda’s hatred for serpents stems from a deep mythological rivalry, and he is often depicted in combat with them. Temples dedicated to Vishnu frequently feature Garuda statues, and he is worshipped as a guardian figure, protector from evil, poison, and snakes. In many Southeast Asian cultures influenced by Hindu mythology, Garuda is also seen as a national symbol and heroic figure.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Next time, when they pick up a new word, they should pay attention to whether native speakers use it only in formal speaking or writing. And another thing they need to do is to reassess their use of polite phrases, like if they've used too many in the past and should reduce their use a bit so they don't lose their audience before getting to the main point.", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 0}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: \"O Stree Repu Ra\" is a popular phrase from Indian folklore, particularly in the southern states, translating to \"Oh Lady, come tomorrow.\" This phrase is associated with a ghostly legend of a female spirit, often referred to as \"Stree\" or \"Chudail,\" who is believed to roam at night, preying on men. According to the legend, she knocks on doors and calls out to potential victims.

His defense centered around confusion and the necessity to survive in an inhospitable environment.

Additionally, Mr. Medina was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. The judge emphasized that the trespasser had violated the Byron family’s trust and subjected them to unnecessary emotional distress.\nThe verdict seems appropriate, if a little severe on the human level, as Mr. Medina’s actions disrupted the family’s sense of security, regardless of his intentions.

[SEP] Response: Known for his trademark gelled spiked up crew cut with sunglasses, Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) is an Indian Bollywood movie star, movie producer, magazine model, showman, public speaker, author, philanthropist and television host/personality working predominantly in Hindi cinema.Khan began his on-camera acting debut in 1987 at the age of 21 by guest starring in various Indian serial drama soap opera TV shows as well as appearing in numerous television commercials and brand advertisements for products. He studied theatre arts and drama during his second year of college after participating in numerous school plays. He landed a few acting gigs in Delhi, before acting on Indian TV and became popular. Khan came down to Mumbai to shoot a TV series with self doubt and under confidence. So he came for a year to give it a shot. He began auditioning for starring roles in Hindi movies in 1990 after the death of his mother (his father died a decade earlier in 1980). Khan's parents died early, which made him heartbroken in Delhi. Khan decided to pursue a full-time acting career and relocating to Mumbai to start afresh, hoping to enjoy acting and overcome the dejecting death of his parents, as there was nothing for him to go back to. He began auditioning for starring roles in Hindi movies in 1990 after the death of his mother (his father died a decade earlier in 1980).\n\nAfter recuperating from a career-ending sports injury, he landed his breakout breakthrough feature film starring role in the Silver screen in June 1992, and rose to prominence in the mid-to-late 1990s. Khan shot to stardom in his first feature film \"Deewana\" (1992) which won him the first of 13 Filmfare awards -- the Bollywood equivalent of an Oscar. He continued starring in blockbuster movies throughout the 2000s with a mixed bag of career fluctuations, establishing himself as a very bankable, versatile movie star in the early-to-mid 2010s. Following a 4-year sabbatical hiatus in the wake of the corona-virus pandemic, Khan made a resurgence comeback in 2023, and continues to act and star in A-Lister blockbuster movies.\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 2}

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now, so it's good you reached out.\nFirst, with your job, it's completely understandable to feel stressed with unsupportive management.  It's tough when your efforts aren't acknowledged. Before you make any big decisions, maybe try documenting specific instances where you excelled and the lack of recognition.  Sometimes having concrete examples helps you see the situation more clearly, and it might be useful if you decide to discuss your concerns with HR or look for other opportunities.  Don't underestimate the impact of a toxic work environment on your well-being.\nAs for Tia, relationships can be really complicated. It's sad when things don't work out, especially when you had hopes.  Allow yourself time to grieve and process the situation.  Try to focus on self-care and doing things you enjoy. Heartbreak is never easy, but it does get better.  Remember, you are worthy of love and happiness.\nYou're not bothering me at all.

[SEP] Response: Space travel has evolved from heroic exploration to routine technical missions, but the emergence of space tourism promises to transform the industry. Pioneers like Dennis Tito and Mark Shuttleworth have already paid millions for brief trips into orbit, and this trend will likely expand as costs decrease. Surveys indicate that thousands of affluent individuals will be willing to pay for short space experiences, potentially creating a multi-million-dollar market. Visionaries such as Robert Bigelow are developing comfortable space habitats that will accommodate tourists with amenities comparable to luxury hotels, including multi-level living spaces and entertainment options. While some experts caution that the dangers of space travel will remain significant and that accidents may occur, the industry will continue to innovate and grow. In the near future, space hotels will redefine human travel, offering a new frontier where imagination and technology converge, inviting people to choose between practical gear and stylish spacewear for their journeys.\n\n", "task_id": "8ccc73b1-95ed-4b71-8fc5-065b57a0f5f0", "level_title": "Travel Industry", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: One important thing I thought is that the landscape of language learning has undergone a significant transformation over the years. In the past, language students relied heavily on traditional classroom instruction, textbooks, and tedious grammar exercises. The lack of interactive resources and limited access to native speakers made language learning a daunting task.\n\nI've found it surprisingly easy to access to a plethora of innovative language learning tools and platforms. Mobile apps, online courses, and social media have revolutionized the way we learn languages. However, despite these advancements, language learners still face numerous challenges.\n\nI didn't think of it but one of the primary concerns is the overwhelming amount of information available, making it difficult for learners to discern quality resources from mediocre ones. Additionally, the lack of personalized feedback and support can hinder progress. Moreover, language learners must navigate the complexities of cultural nuances, idiomatic expressions, and context-dependent language use.\n\nAs we look to the future, it is essential to address these challenges and harness the potential of technology to create more effective, personalized, and immersive language learning experiences. By doing so, we can empower language learners to overcome the obstacles and achieve their goals.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The Naga is a legendary creature prominent in Indian mythology and folklore.  Depicted as a serpent with a human form or a human with a serpent's tail, Nagas are associated with water, fertility, and the underworld.  They are often portrayed as powerful beings, capable of shapeshifting and possessing venomous bites.\nNagas inhabit Nagaloka or Patala, the subterranean realm, where they guard immense treasures.  They are frequently featured in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions.  In some stories, they are benevolent guardians of nature, while in others, they are fearsome creatures who bring misfortune.  The story of Vasuki, the serpent king used as a rope in the Samudra Manthana (churning of the cosmic ocean), is a popular example.\nNagas hold significant cultural importance and are often depicted in art, architecture, and literature.  Their symbolism is complex, representing both the dangers and the life-giving potential of the natural world.

There were multiple documents to be signed, so many that it would take two days to complete reading before putting signatures. There was no transparency. Copies of all signed documents were not handed over, only a handful were given back. From my experience as a first time home loan taker, I felt absolutely disgusted over the complexities of the process. Even the guidelines of the prime banking institution  of the country is not adequately followed. Unnecessary documents and insurances are  forced while taking the loan. I can tell it was not a cherished experience. The excitement of buying a home absolutely went down the drain owing to such complex, confusing and misguided process followed by bank. I felt three things should absolutely be followed while banks take up such processes which are transparency clarity and communication, to make the entire process little easier for first time home buyers who aspire to take a loan.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: CSR commitment is an asset that should be valued, because it lays the foundations for a more resilient company, according to an Indeed analysis. It's not just about marketing, because the company is obliged to respect and apply certain standards or rules, which can initially represent a substantial investment. However, this will soon be offset and amortised by a number of positive spin-offs:\n\nIn economic terms, the CSR approach has an impact on management strategy, as it helps to anticipate risks, improve efficiency and optimise costs. It is a means of securing the company's business over the medium and long term.\n\nThe actions taken as part of a CSR policy, particularly in terms of responsible purchasing, also help to build a healthy and balanced relationship with the company's suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nCSR has an important social component, which translates into objectives in terms of working conditions, well-being and employee motivation.The initiatives we have put in place aim to promote quality of life at work and encourage dialogue within a calm working environment.\n\nCSR also incorporates values relating to equality, non-discrimination and fair pay within the company.\n\nFinally, implementing a CSR policy is also an opportunity for the company to take an interest in the entire ecosystem in which it operates and the consequences of its activities on the environment.It identifies its main impacts (greenhouse gas emissions, consumption of resources, production of waste, pollution, etc.), defines and implements an action plan to reduce them and measures its results.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

The market is characterized by complex national regulations and consolidation among the largest international groups. These mergers are driven by the need for economies of scale and increasing R&D investments.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline\n\nGlaxoSmithKline, formed in 2000 through the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, is a leading research-focused company. Headquartered in the U.K. with operations in the U.S., it employs over 90,000 people globally and holds about 7% of the world's pharmaceutical market.

[SEP] Response: The recent emissions summit ended after intense negotiations, with countries agreeing to a moderate plan to reduce carbon emissions by 10 percent over the next ten years. This decision came after rejecting a more ambitious proposal that aimed to cut emissions in half within five years. The summit’s outcome reflects a balance between environmental concerns and economic realities.\n\nFrench Energy Minister Yvonne DePaul expressed satisfaction with the deal, stating that the plan was a result of careful consideration and that it is the most achievable option for Europe. Similarly, UK Prime Minister Andrew Campbell described the agreement as a \"win-win\" for Europe, showing his approval of the compromise reached.\n\nHowever, not everyone was pleased. German Environment Minister Sebastian Kunst criticized the deal, arguing that the reduction is insufficient to significantly impact global climate change. He emphasized the need for more aggressive action and indicated that Germany would continue discussions to find better solutions.\n\nOverall, the summit’s agreement marks progress but also reveals ongoing challenges in reaching a consensus on climate action.\n\n", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 4}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Márcia Fernandes\tRevisão por Márcia Fernandes Professora de Língua Portuguesa e Literatura\n\n\nRemover anúncios\nA crônica é um gênero textual curto escrito em prosa, geralmente produzido para meios de comunicação, por exemplo, jornais, revistas, etc.\n\nAlém de ser um texto curto, possui uma \"vida curta\", ou seja, as crônicas tratam de acontecimentos corriqueiros do cotidiano.\n\nA palavra crônica, do latim chronica, refere-se a um registro de eventos marcados pelo tempo cronológico. Do grego khronos, significa tempo.\n\nAssim, as crônicas estão extremamente conectadas ao contexto em que são produzidas, por isso, com o passar do tempo, elas perdem sua “validade”, ou seja, ficam fora do contexto.\n\nAs características das crônicas\nnarrativa curta;\nuso de uma linguagem simples e coloquial;\npresença de poucos personagens, se houver;\nespaço reduzido;\ntemas relacionados a acontecimentos cotidianos.\nTipos de crônicas\nEmbora seja um texto que faz parte do gênero narrativo (com enredo, foco narrativo, personagens, tempo e espaço), há diversos tipos de crônicas que exploram outros gêneros textuais.\n\nPodemos destacar a crônica descritiva e a crônica dissertativa. Além delas, temos:\n\ncrônica jornalística: mais comum das crônicas da atualidade, são as crônicas chamadas de “crônicas jornalísticas” produzidas para os meios de comunicação, onde utilizam temas da atualidade para fazerem reflexões. Aproxima-se da crônica dissertativa.\ncrônica histórica: marcada por relatar fatos ou acontecimentos históricos, com personagens, tempo e espaço definidos. Aproxima-se da crônica narrativa.\ncrônica humorística: esse tipo de crônica apela para o humor como forma de entreter o público, ao mesmo tempo que utiliza da ironia e do humor como ferramenta essencial para criticar alguns aspectos seja da sociedade, política, cultura, economia, etc.\nImportante destacar que muitas crônicas podem ser formadas por dois ou mais tipos, por exemplo: uma crônica jornalística e humorística.\n\nExemplos de crônicas\n1. Crônica de Machado de Assis (Gazeta de Notícias, 1889)\nQuem nunca invejou, não sabe o que é padecer. Eu sou uma lástima. Não posso ver uma roupinha melhor em outra pessoa, que não sinta o dente da inveja morder-me as entranhas. É uma comoção tão ruim, tão triste, tão profunda, que dá vontade de matar. Não há remédio para esta doença. Eu procuro distrair-me nas ocasiões; como não posso falar, entro a contar os pingos de chuva, se chove, ou os basbaques que andam pela rua, se faz sol; mas não passo de algumas dezenas. O pensamento não me deixa ir avante. A roupinha melhor faz-me foscas, a cara do dono faz-me caretas...\n\n\nRemover anúncios\nFoi o que me aconteceu, depois da última vez que estive aqui. Há dias, pegando numa folha da manhã, li uma lista de candidaturas para deputados por Minas, com seus comentos e prognósticos. Chego a um dos distritos, não me lembra qual, nem o nome da pessoa, e que hei de ler? Que o candidato era apresentado pelos três partidos, liberal, conservador e republicano.\n\nA primeira coisa que senti, foi uma vertigem. Depois, vi amarelo. Depois, não vi mais nada. As entranhas doíam-me, como se um facão as rasgasse, a boca tinha um sabor de fel, e nunca mais pude encarar as linhas da notícia. Rasguei afinal a folha, e perdi os dois vinténs; mas eu estava pronto a perder dois milhões, contando que aquilo fosse comigo.\n\nUpa! que caso único. Todos os partidos armados uns contra os outros no resto do Império, naquele ponto uniam-se e depositavam sobre a cabeça de um homem os seus princípios. Não faltará quem ache tremenda a responsabilidade do eleito, — porque a eleição, em tais circunstâncias, é certa; cá para mim é exatamente o contrário. Dêem-me dessas responsabilidades, e verão se me saio delas sem demora, logo na discussão do voto de graças.\n\n— Trazido a esta Câmara (diria eu) nos paveses de gregos e troianos, e não só dos gregos que amam o colérico Aquiles, filho de Peleu, como dos que estão com Agamenon, chefe dos chefes, posso exultar mais que nenhum outro, porque nenhum outro é, como eu, a unidade nacional. Vós representais os vários membros do corpo; eu sou o corpo inteiro, completo. Disforme, não; não monstro de Horácio, por quê? Vou dizê-lo.\n\nE diria então que ser conservador era ser essencialmente liberal, e que no uso da liberdade, no seu desenvolvimento, nas suas mais amplas reformas, estava a melhor conservação. Vede uma floresta! (exclamaria, levantando os braços). Que potente liberdade! e que ordem segura! A natureza, liberal e pródiga na produção, é conservadora por excelência na harmonia em que aquela vertigem de troncos, folhas e cipós, em que aquela passarada estrídula, se unem para formar a floresta. Que exemplo às sociedades! Que lição aos partidos!\n\nO mais difícil parece que era a união dos princípios monárquicos e dos princípios republicanos; puro engano. Eu diria: 1°, que jamais consentiria que nenhuma das duas formas de governo se sacrificasse por mim; eu é que era por ambas; 2°, que considerava tão necessária uma como outra, não dependendo tudo senão dos termos; assim podíamos ter na monarquia a república coroada, enquanto que a república podia ser a liberdade no trono, etc., etc.\n\nNem todos concordariam comigo; creio até que ninguém, ou concordariam todos, mas cada um com uma parte. Sim, o acordo pleno das opiniões só uma vez se deu abaixo do sol, há muitos anos, e foi na assembléia provincial do Rio de Janeiro. Orava um deputado, cujo nome absolutamente me esqueceu, como o de dois, um liberal, outro conservador, que virgulavam o discurso com apartes, — os mesmos apartes.\n\nA questão era simples. O orador, que era novo, expunha as suas idéias políticas. Dizia que opinava por isso ou por aquilo. Um dos apartistas acudia: é liberal. Redargüia o outro: é conservador. Tinha o orador mais este e aquele propósito. É conservador, dizia o segundo; é liberal, teimava o primeiro. Em tais condições, prosseguia o novato, é meu intuito seguir este caminho. Redargüia o liberal: é liberal; e o conservador: é conservador. Durou este divertimento três quartos de colunas do Jornal do Comércio. Eu guardei um exemplar da folha para acudir às minhas melancolias, mas perdi-o numa das mudanças de casa.\n\nOh! não mudeis de casa! Mudai de roupa, mudai de fortuna, de amigos, de opinião, de criados, mudai de tudo, mas não mudeis de casa!\n\n2. A sensível (Clarice Lispector)\nFoi então que ela atravessou uma crise que nada parecia ter a ver com sua vida: uma crise de profunda piedade. A cabeça tão limitada, tão bem penteada, mal podia suportar perdoar tanto. Não podia olhar o rosto de um tenor enquanto este cantava alegre – virava para o lado o rosto magoado, insuportável, por piedade, não suportando a glória do cantor. Na rua de repente comprimia o peito com as mãos enluvadas – assaltada de perdão. Sofria sem recompensa, sem mesmo a simpatia por si própria.\n\nEssa mesma senhora, que sofreu de sensibilidade como de doença, escolheu um domingo em que o marido viajava para procurar a bordadeira. Era mais um passeio que uma necessidade. Isso ela sempre soubera: passear. Como se ainda fosse a menina que passeia na calçada. Sobretudo passeava muito quando “sentia” que o marido a enganava. Assim foi procurar a bordadeira, no domingo de manhã. Desceu uma rua cheia de lama, de galinhas e de crianças nuas – aonde fora se meter! A bordadeira, na casa cheia de filhos com cara de fome, o marido tuberculoso – a bordadeira recusou-se a bordar a toalha porque não gostava de fazer ponto de cruz! Saiu afrontada e perplexa. “Sentia-se” tão suja pelo calor da manhã, e um de seus prazeres era pensar que sempre, desde pequena, fora muito limpa. Em casa almoçou sozinha, deitou-se no quarto meio escurecido, cheia de sentimentos maduros e sem amargura. Oh pelo menos uma vez não “sentia” nada. Senão talvez a perplexidade diante da liberdade da bordadeira pobre. Senão talvez um sentimento de espera. A liberdade.\nAté que, dias depois, a sensibilidade se curou assim como uma ferida seca. Aliás, um mês depois, teve seu primeiro amante, o primeiro de uma alegre série.\n\n3. O amor e a morte (Carlos Heitor Cony)\nFoi em dezembro, dez anos atrás. Mila teve nove filhotes, impossível ficar com a ninhada inteira, fiquei com aquela que me parecia a mais próxima da mãe.\n\nNasceu em minha casa, foi gerada em minha casa, nela viveu esses dez anos, participando de tudo, recebendo meus amigos na sala, cheirando-os e ficando ao lado deles - sabendo que, de alguma forma, devia homenageá-los por mim e por ela.\n\nAo contrário da mãe, que tinha alguma autonomia existencial, aquilo que eu chamava de “fumos fidalgos”, como o Dom Casmurro, Títi era um prolongamento, o dia e a noite, o sol e todas as estrelas, o universo dela centrava-se em acompanhar, resumia-se em estar perto.\n\nQuando Mila foi embora, há dois anos, ela compreendeu que ficara mais importante -e, se isso fosse possível, mais amada. Escoou com sabedoria a dor e o pranto, a ausência e a tristeza, e se já era atenta aos movimentos mais insignificantes da casa, com o tempo tornou-se um pedaço significante da vida em geral e do meu mundo particular.\n\nVida e mundo que deverão, agora, continuar sem ela -se é que posso chamar de continuação o que tenho pela frente. Perdi alguns amigos, recentemente, mas foram perdas coletivas que doeram, mas, de certa forma, são compensadas pela repartição do prejuízo.\n\nPerder Títi é um “resto de terra arrancado” de mim mesmo -e estou citando pela segunda vez Machado de Assis, que criou um cão com o nome do dono (Quincas Borba) e sabia como ninguém que dono e cão são uma coisa só.\n\nEssa “coisa só” fica mais só, nem por isso fica mais forte, como queria Ibsen. Fica apenas mais sozinho mesmo, sem ter aquele olhar que vai fundo da gente e adivinha até a alegria e a tristeza que sentimos sem compreender. Sem Títi, é mais fácil aceitar que a morte seja tão poderosa, desde que seja bem menos poderosa do que o amor.\n\nA Crônica no Brasil\nA crônica foi inicialmente desenvolvida com caráter histórico (as crônicas históricas). Elas relatavam, desde o século XV, fatos históricos (reais ou fictícios) ou acontecimentos cotidianos (sucessão cronológica), algumas com toque de humor.\n\nMais tarde, esse gênero textual despretensioso foi se aproximando do público e conquistando os leitores mundo afora. Hoje, esse fato é confirmado pela enorme difusão das crônicas, sobretudo nos meios de comunicação.\n\nNo Brasil, a crônica tornou-se um estilo textual bem difundido, desde a publicação dos folhetins, em meados do século XIX. Alguns escritores brasileiros que se destacaram como cronistas foram:\n\nMachado de Assis\nCarlos Drummond de Andrade\nRubem Braga\nLuís Fernando Veríssimo\nFernando Sabino\nCarlos Heitor Cony\nCaio Fernando Abreu\nSegundo o professor e crítico literário Antônio Cândido, em seu artigo “A vida ao rés-do-chão” (1980):\n\n“A crônica não é um “gênero maior”. Não se imagina uma literatura feita de grandes cronistas, que lhe dessem o brilho universal dos grandes romancistas, dramaturgos e poetas. Nem se pensaria em atribuir o Prêmio Nobel a um cronista, por melhor que fosse. Portanto, parece mesmo que a crônica é um gênero menor. “Graças a Deus”, seria o caso de dizer, porque sendo assim ela fica mais perto de nós. E para muitos pode servir de caminho não apenas para a vida, que ela serve de perto, mas para a literatura (...).\n\n(...) Ora, a crônica está sempre ajudando a estabelecer ou restabelecer a dimensão das coisas e das pessoas. Em lugar de oferecer um cenário excelso, numa revoada de adjetivos e períodos candentes, pega o miúdo e mostra nele uma grandeza, uma beleza ou uma singularidade insuspeitadas. Ela é amiga da verdade e da poesia nas suas formas mais diretas e também nas suas formas mais fantásticas, sobretudo porque quase sempre utiliza o humor. Isto acontece porque não tem pretensões a durar, uma vez que é filha do jornal e da era da máquina, onde tudo acaba tão depressa. Ela não foi feita originalmente para o livro, mas para essa publicação efêmera que se compra num dia e no dia seguinte é usada para embrulhar um par de sapatos ou forrar o chão da cozinha.”\n\nNesse trecho, Antônio Cândido destaca algumas características da crônica: a aproximação com o público, através de uma linguagem mais direta e despretensiosa, além da duração temporária da publicação.\n\nPara saber mais sobre crônica:\n\nComo fazer uma crônica\nCrônica narrativa\nCrônica argumentativa\nExercícios sobre crônicas (com gabarito comentado)\n\nPara estudar mais:\n\nGêneros textuais\nO que é Romance?\nConto: o que é, características e tipos (com exemplos)\nMárcia Fernandes\nRevisão por Márcia Fernandes\nProfessora, produz conteúdos educativos desde 2015.

[SEP] Response: Performance Review for Oliver Murray\n\nGeneral Performance\nOliver Murray has demonstrated exceptional potential in his first year with our company. He made a very strong start, showcasing an impressive combination of creativity, intelligence, and diligence. Oliver consistently works hard to achieve success and has proven to be an unusually clever problem-solver. His commitment to excellence is evident in his day-to-day performance, as he rarely makes mistakes and continually brings fresh ideas to the table.\n\nKey Achievements\nOliver's contributions to the organization have been substantial in just a short period. Notably, he identified and resolved a critical product error, resulting in significant cost savings for the company. His outstanding performance earned him the \"Employee of the Month\" award on two separate occasions, and his impact was recognized with a promotion after just six months—a remarkable achievement that reflects his value to the team.\n\nAreas of Improvement\nWhile Oliver's performance has been exemplary in many respects, there are areas where growth is needed. On two occasions, he missed important deadlines without informing his team, which impacted project timelines. Additionally, Oliver could focus more on fostering stronger collaboration and being considerate of team dynamics, ensuring that his efforts align with the collective goals of the group.\n\nGoals\nTo build on his successes, Oliver should prioritize improving his time management skills to meet deadlines consistently and communicate proactively when challenges arise. Furthermore, he should aim to enhance his teamwork by engaging more thoughtfully with colleagues and contributing to a more cohesive work environment. These adjustments will help Oliver grow into an even more effective and well-rounded contributor to the company.\n\nOverall, Oliver’s first year has been marked by notable achievements and immense potential.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is not just an ethical obligation but a practical necessity in today's interconnected world. While some argue that a company's sole responsibility is to maximize profits for its shareholders, this view overlooks the long-term benefits of investing in societal and environmental well-being.\nFirst, CSR fosters trust and loyalty among consumers. In a competitive market, companies that demonstrates genuine care for societal issues often attract and retain customers who value ethical practices. This, tur, enhances brand reputation and can lead to increased profitability. As lil@213 pointed out, it's a two-way street-businesses thrive in communities that they support and invest in.\nSecond, CSR initiatives improve employee satisfaction and productivity. Offering fair wages, promoting diversity, and creating sustainable workplaces cultivate a positive work culture, reducing turnover and associated costs. This aligns with Jack@MSU's observation that CSR can contribute directly to a company's bottom line.\nOn the contrary, dismissing CSR as mere marketing, as JackD_92 suggests, undermines its broader impact. While some companies may exploit it superficially, genuine CSR initiatives can address pressing global issues like climate change, inequality, and resource depletion-areas where governments alone often fall short.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: After evaluating two training providers, TrainQuick and Skills Pro, I recommend moving forward with Skills Pro for our staff development needs.\n\nWhile TrainQuick offers cheaper and more flexible options, there are significant concerns. In particular, employees at our other branch have not been using the program, and there have been complaints about mixing staff from different branches in the same classes. These factors may reduce engagement and effectiveness.\n\nOn the other hand, although Skills Pro is more expensive, the overall quality appears to be higher. Some employees have described the course content as challenging, but most participants complete it successfully. This suggests that the program is both rigorous and well-structured. Additionally, Skills Pro has plans to expand their course offerings, which may benefit us in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the higher cost, Skills Pro provides a more professional and successful learning experience.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most fascinating legendary creatures from Greek mythology is the Minotaur, a fearsome creature that is half-man, half-bull. According to the myth, the Minotaur was born from the union of Pasiphae, the wife of King Minos, and a sacred bull sent by Poseidon. To contain the beast, King Minos ordered the construction of a labyrinth on the island of Crete, a maze so intricate that no one who entered it could ever escape.\n\nThe Minotaur dwelled within this labyrinth, and every year, Athens was required to send seven young men and seven young women as a tribute to be sacrificed to the creature. The story of the Minotaur’s eventual demise is a heroic one, as the Athenian prince Theseus volunteered to enter the labyrinth, guided by a thread given to him by Minos' daughter, Ariadne. Theseus defeated the Minotaur, ending the reign of terror it had cast over Crete.\n\nThe Minotaur represents both the primal, beastly nature within humanity and the complexity of human desires, making it one of the most enduring symbols in Greek mythology.\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 15-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language is an exciting yet often overwhelming experience. Many language students face a series of challenges that can sometimes hinder progress or lead to frustration.\n\nOne common issue is motivation. When the initial excitement fades, learners often struggle to stay committed. The long journey to fluency can feel discouraging, especially when progress seems slow. To overcome this, it's essential to set small, achievable goals, such as mastering a set number of vocabulary words each week or engaging in short conversations with native speakers.\n\nAnother challenge is pronunciation. Even if students grasp the rules of grammar and vocabulary, getting the pronunciation right can be difficult, especially with languages that have sounds not present in one’s native tongue. Consistent practice and listening to native speakers can help, as can focusing on specific sounds or accents.\n\nCultural differences also play a role in language learning. Understanding not just the words, but the cultural context, idiomatic expressions, and social norms tied to a language can be overwhelming. Immersion in the culture through media, travel, or conversations with native speakers is one of the best ways to bridge this gap.\n\nFinally, there’s the challenge of confidence. Many learners fear making mistakes, but it's important to remember that mistakes are part of the learning process. With persistence, these obstacles can be overcome, leading to success and fluency.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

The pace here is slower, the atmosphere reflective, and the spirit of the past lives harmoniously with the present.\nBoth cities offer unforgettable experiences, yet Paris thrives on vibrancy while Kyoto embraces tranquility.

This would not only keep costs down compared to a full construction project but also revitalize an underused part of the city.\n\nThe location is central, making it easily accessible for residents, and there’s plenty of room for parking, which would be a major advantage. Plus, the building already has strong structural foundations, which could make the renovation process quicker and more cost-effective.\n\nThis option would meet our community's needs and align with our sustainability goals by reusing an existing space.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a USstock market indicator that was first developed by Charles Dow in 1896.\nCharles Dow, who was from New England, began his career as a newspaper writer in Massachusetts. He later went to New York City and held a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1882, Dow and a man named Edward Jones started afinancial servicescompany which today publishes The Wall Street Journal. Charles Dow wrote articles for The Wall Street Journal newspaper that developed the use of an index that was the average price of twelve railroad stocks whose daily prices were added together and divided by twelve. This average served as an indicator of thenational economy.\nToday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) uses an index derived from thirty stocks. The selected stocks representblue chip companiesfrom a variety of business areas, such as financial services, technology, pharmaceutical and energy, including well known international companies such as IBM, Citigroup Inc, and Merck and Co. The thirty stocks are chosen by the editors of the Wall Street Journal, a practice that dates back to the beginning of the century. The stock prices of the thirty companies are divided by a number that accounts for stock splits anddividends, and the index is computed using aprice-weighted indexing system, rather than the more common market-value (or capitalization) weighted indexing system.\nThere are four Dow Jones Averages: Industrial, Transportation, Utilities, and Composite (the other three put together).

[SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in my country can be both exciting and challenging. The process generally involves multiple steps and requires significant preparation.\n\nFirst, finding the right home is a crucial step. Many people prefer using real estate agents because they have access to listings and can negotiate on your behalf. Once you’ve found a property, the next step is to arrange financing. Applying for a home loan typically requires submitting various documents, including proof of income, employment details, identification, and bank statements. The process can feel tedious due to the number of forms and the detailed verification required.\n\nHousing prices vary greatly depending on the location. In urban areas, homes tend to be more expensive due to high demand, whereas rural properties are relatively affordable. Interest rates for home loans are determined by financial institutions and fluctuate based on the economy. Currently, they range between 7-9% annually, but this can vary.\n\nMany people choose to work with a mortgage broker to find the best loan options and rates, especially if they are new to the process. Others prefer dealing directly with banks.\n\nOverall, while the process can be time-consuming and costly, proper planning and professional assistance can make it manageable.

Additionally, strong leaders are adaptable and open to feedback, constantly striving to improve themselves and their teams.\n\nDeveloping leadership also includes fostering teamwork, providing mentorship, and encouraging others to take initiative.

It all started when he decided to take a spontaneous trip to the bustling streets of Pune. Arjun, always the adventurer, was drawn to the vibrant energy of the city and its rich cultural heritage.\n\nWhile wandering through the narrow lanes of the old city, Arjun stumbled upon an antique shop tucked away in a corner. The shop, with its dusty windows and eclectic collection of artifacts, seemed to beckon him inside. As he browsed through the shelves, his eyes fell upon a peculiar-looking amulet. Intrigued by its intricate design, he decided to purchase it.\n\nLittle did Arjun know, this amulet held a secret. That evening, as he sat in his hotel room examining his new find, the amulet began to glow softly. Suddenly, the room was filled with a warm, golden light, and Arjun found himself transported to a different time and place. He was standing in the middle of a grand palace, surrounded by people dressed in regal attire.\n\nArjun soon realized he had been transported to the era of the Maratha Empire. He spent the next few hours exploring the palace, conversing with historical figures, and witnessing events that shaped the course of history. As the night drew to a close, the amulet's glow faded, and Arjun was back in his hotel room, left with memories of an unforgettable adventure.\n\nThe next morning, Arjun returned to the antique shop, hoping to learn more about the amulet. However, the shopkeeper simply smiled and said, \"Some things are meant to be discovered, not explained.\" Arjun left the shop with a sense of wonder, knowing that he had experienced something truly extraordinary.\n", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

What do you use now, and how has it changed your reading habits? Pay attention to your use of commas, colons and semicolons. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: When I was a student, we could only study from printed books. Digital publishing changed everything. People read on tablets, e-readers, laptops, and desktop computers. Instead of carrying a heavy backpack full of textbooks, I'm surprised to see students now doing all their homework on a tablet. These days, the use of books is becoming increasingly limited.\nStudents simply click a link on their devices; a pop-up window will immediately provide them with useful information. Even better, a video might appear with an explanation. Electronic media also allows font sizes to be changed for easier reading. Artificial intelligence is also increasingly providing more information, but we must be very careful with its use.\nAnother big difference with digital media is that anyone can self-publish easily and affordably. In other words, you can create your own original publications:\non various topics, for example, mathematics, on a website, an essay for a blog, or even an e-book for a publisher or online bookstore. As a result, there are millions of fascinating texts to read that were previously unavailable. Our personal world is expanding thanks to electronic media.

Be sure to polish your work before you submit it. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Birthday’s origin\nIn ancient Rome, there was the habit of celebrating the birthday of a person. There weren’t parties like we know today, but cakes were prepared and offers were made. Then, the habits of wishing happy birthday, giving gifts and lighting candles became popular as a way to protect the birthday person from devils and ensure good things to the next year in the person’s life. The celebrations only became popular like we know today after fourteen centuries, in a collective festival performed in Germany\n\n\n\n\nDepartment Stores\nThe first department store was created in Paris, in 1850. It was conceived as a big place with a lot of options in products and brands. They wouldn’t sell just a specific product: there you could  find clothes, shoes, jewels, make up and many others things. That concept remained until today. So, if you want to buy many things with good prices, you can choose from one of the thousands in the world.\n\nEvery year, on the day after Thanksgiving, most of this stores have a big sale called Black Friday.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: After evaluating both TrainQuick and Skills Pro, it becomes evident that Skills Pro is the more suitable choice, despite its higher cost. TrainQuick offers affordability and flexibility, which are attractive features. However, it faces significant challenges: employees in other branches are not utilizing it, and there is notable dissatisfaction when classes mix participants from different branches. These issues undermine its overall effectiveness and acceptance among employees.\n\nOn the other hand, Skills Pro, although more expensive and described as difficult, has a higher success rate among participants. This suggests that while the course content is challenging, it is also manageable and ultimately beneficial. Moreover, Skills Pro's plans to expand their course content indicate a commitment to continuous improvement and staying relevant in the training industry.\n\nInvesting in Skills Pro aligns with our priority on quality training. It ensures that our employees receive comprehensive and effective education, which is crucial for their professional development and our organization's success. This strategic decision underscores our commitment to excellence and is likely to yield better long-term results in terms of employee performance and satisfaction.

Have a look at your checklist, then write him an email advising him of the changes he has to make. Write 150-200 words.

I understand that you’re facing high insurance quotes for your secondhand clothes shop, especially since you’re renting an old building. After conducting a risk assessment, here are a few recommendations to help mitigate potential risks and possibly lower your insurance costs:\nRisk Assessment Checklist\n•\tBuilding Integrity: Ensure the structural integrity of the building by having it inspected by a professional. Address any repairs needed for the roof, walls, and foundation to prevent potential hazards.\n•\tFire Safety: Install smoke detectors, fire alarms, and fire extinguishers.

The process involves filling out numerous forms, and banks in France are known for being thorough in their credit assessments. Interest rates are relatively low but have increased slightly, averaging around 3% in 2024 for fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nAlthough not legally required, most buyers choose to work with a real estate agent to navigate the real estate market and a mortgage broker to help them find the best loan deals. These professionals can simplify the process.\n\nThe home buying process is regulated and involves additional costs like notary fees (7-8% of the property price) and taxes.

Offering them autonomy while providing support can also drive motivation. When individuals feel empowered to make decisions, they take more ownership of their work.\n\nHowever, avoid micromanaging, as it can diminish trust and motivation.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 7-Intermediate [SEP] Prompt: Read the class assignment. Then write your response on the class discussion board. Remember to take a stand on the proposal and support your position with reasons and examples. Type in the input box. Write 45-70 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: I am strongly opposed to the proposal to cut physical education and sports classes in favor of test preparation classes for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, physical education and sports play a crucial role in the overall development of students. They provide essential benefits beyond physical health, including improved mental health, better focus, and stress reduction. Engaging in physical activities helps students develop teamwork and leadership skills, which are crucial for their personal and professional lives. Removing these classes could negatively impact students' well-being and social development.\n\nSecondly, while test preparation is important, dedicating three hours a week throughout the entire year to test prep could lead to burnout and diminish enthusiasm for learning. Students need a balanced education that includes both academic and physical activities. Overemphasizing test preparation may lead to a narrow focus on test-taking skills rather than a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.\n\nMoreover, numerous studies have shown that a well-rounded education, which includes physical education, contributes to better academic performance. Physical activity has been linked to improved concentration, memory, and classroom behavior, which can, in turn, enhance test performance. Therefore, cutting sports and physical education could inadvertently undermine the very goal the proposal aims to achieve.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention to improve test scores is understandable, eliminating physical education and sports is not the right approach. Instead, schools should strive for a balanced curriculum that supports both academic excellence and the physical and mental well-being of students.", "task_id": "8dab61c3-5199-4396-87e2-1618ae59b47a", "level_title": "7-Intermediate", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Maritime [SEP] Prompt: Should e-nav tools replace all traditional equipment on ships? Use your own ideas. Type in the input box. Write 80-100 words. [SEP] Response: Many maritime experts argue that maintaining traditional methods like paper charts, manual compasses, and celestial navigation is a matter of safety and resilience. If a cyberattack hits, or electronics fail mid-voyage, a ship’s only fallback could be those analog tools—and the crew’s ability to use them.\nSome navies and shipping companies use a hybrid approach, leaning heavily on e-nav but requiring proficiency in traditional methods. It's kind of like flying with autopilot on—you still want a pilot who knows how to land manually.\nSo maybe it’s less about replacing and more about complementing. Would you trust a ship running on software alone, or do you think there’s still a place for the old-school compass in a drawer?\nWant to dive into how different countries regulate this balance?
