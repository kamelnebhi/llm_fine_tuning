Regarding your work situation, it's completely valid to feel frustrated when your efforts aren't acknowledged. One practical approach is to set small, personal goals that give you a sense of progress, even if management doesn't recognize it. Consider speaking with a trusted colleague or HR about how you’re feeling—it might help ease the pressure or even spark change.\n\nAs for your relationship with Tia, it’s natural to grieve when something hopeful begins to unravel. Give yourself space to process it emotionally. It might help to talk to a counselor or even just spend more time with friends doing things you enjoy. Remind yourself that relationships, like jobs, don’t define your worth.\n\nTry grounding techniques or mindfulness exercises to stay present and reduce anxiety. Journaling your thoughts can also be therapeutic.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: The Big Online Debate\nDo you believe companies have a responsibility to society? Or do you think a company's only responsibility is to its shareholders? We invite you to join this discussion by posting your opinion on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nFor CSR\n\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 0}

Please pay attention to a few important requirements for the event:\n\n-   It should be safe – not everyone on the team is a thrill-seeker and we want all staff to feel at ease.\n-   It should include activities that build team spirit – we want to get everyone working together and feeling good about themselves and each other.\n-   It must fit our budget – skydiving, for example, might be a bit too expensive.", "task_id": "5949887a-c75f-46ad-95d6-9775e932a1e6", "level_title": "14-Advanced", "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: To: Ken and Josh\nSubject: A Third Option for Our Business Location\n\nHi Ken and Josh,\n\nThanks for laying out the situation so clearly. I’ve been thinking about a third possibility that could offer a compromise between the two options you’ve discussed.\n\nWhat if we moved into the new Riverwalk Market complex near Eastbrook Park? It’s only ten minutes from downtown and still easily accessible to our existing clientele. Rent there is significantly lower—about $2,800 per month for a similarly sized space—and the foot traffic is growing quickly with new restaurants, local boutiques, and weekend events drawing big crowds.\n\nWe could maintain a small, attractive showroom in the Riverwalk space while doing most of our tailoring work in a nearby, cheaper workshop. That keeps our personalized service while reducing overhead. We can also launch a redesigned website and begin offering mobile measuring visits to key clients—gradually building out that service without losing the value of face-to-face interaction.\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I really believe this middle path could balance cost, convenience, and customer connection.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

A gentle breeze rustled the trees, carrying the scent of freshly cut grass. It was a perfect day for a visit to the park.\nMy friends and I decided to meet there. We packed a picnic basket with sandwiches, fruit, and some juice. The park was already alive with activity. Children laughed as they chased pigeons, their joyful shrieks echoing through the air. A couple sat on a bench, sharing a quiet moment, their faces bathed in sunlight.\nWe found a spot under a large oak tree, its branches reaching towards the sky like welcoming arms. We spread out our blanket and unpacked our lunch. The food tasted even better outdoors, the simple pleasures of a sunny day enhancing every bite.\nAfter lunch, we decided to explore. We walked along the winding path, admiring the colorful flowerbeds. The vibrant colors of the roses, daisies, and petunias created a feast for the eyes. A nearby pond reflected the blue sky, and we watched ducks glide gracefully across the surface.\nSome of us played frisbee, our laughter blending with the sounds of nature. Others chose to sit and read, enjoying the peace and quiet. We talked about our dreams, our fears, and our hopes for the future. The park was a place of shared stories and quiet contemplation.\nAs the afternoon wore on, the sun began to dip below the horizon. The golden light painted the sky with hues of orange and pink. It was time to pack up and head home.\nWe left the park with smiles on our faces and a sense of contentment in our hearts. The park had provided a sanctuary, a place to connect with nature, with friends, and with ourselves. It was a perfect day, one that we would cherish for a long time. We knew we would be back soon, to enjoy another day of sunshine and laughter.\nThe memory of the park would stay with us, a reminder of the simple joys of life. We promised ourselves to visit more often, to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and find solace in the tranquility of nature. The park was more than just a place; it was an experience.\nAnd as we walked away, we knew we would return, ", "task_id": "03849587-d03b-45ed-8534-c34536867a8a", "level_title": "12-Upper Intermediate", "label": 0}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature that fascinates many is the wendigo, a mythical being rooted in Algonquian Indigenous folklore from the northeastern forests of North America. The wendigo is often described as a gaunt, emaciated creature with glowing eyes, sharp claws, and a heart of ice. It is said to be the embodiment of greed and hunger—especially the unnatural craving for human flesh.\n\nAccording to legend, the wendigo was once a human who turned into a monster after resorting to cannibalism in the harsh winters. Over time, it grew in size with each person it consumed, yet it remained eternally starved. Some versions of the tale describe it with the head of a deer or a skeletal frame, shrouded in decay and snow.\n\nThe wendigo legend serves as a moral warning against selfishness, gluttony, and the breakdown of social bonds in extreme conditions. It has inspired horror stories, films, and video games, reflecting its lasting grip on the imagination. Though terrifying, the wendigo remains a powerful symbol of nature’s dangers and the consequences of losing one’s humanity.\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Harry,\n\nHere are some ideas that might help you inspire and motivate your team more effectively.\n\nStart by incentivizing your employees. When people feel that the company's success contributes to their own personal success—whether through bonuses, promotions, or recognition—they tend to be more invested in their work. Take a genuine interest in their career development: offer training opportunities and mentorship, and help them envision a future where they continue to grow with the company.\n\nPromote a healthy work-life balance. Respect your team’s time outside work—it builds loyalty and reduces burnout. Just as important: listen. Make sure your employees feel heard, even if what they’re saying is critical. Lastly, treat others the way you’d hope to be treated. Respect and empathy go a long way in building trust.\n\nHere are five behaviors to avoid:\n\nDon’t disrespect those in junior positions.\n\nNever take credit for someone else’s work.\n\nDon’t lose your temper.\n\nAvoid shifting blame unfairly.\n\nAnd never forget to acknowledge great work.\n\nBest of luck—your leadership matters.

You can include the links in your reply. Type in the input box. Write 80-100 words. [SEP] Response: My Opinion on Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is no longer just a trend—it’s a necessity. In my opinion, businesses have a duty not only to their shareholders but also to society and the environment. Companies that invest in CSR show that they care about more than just profit, and this can build strong, lasting relationships with customers and communities.\n\nFirstly, CSR helps create a positive public image. When companies support causes like environmental protection, education, or fair labor practices, people are more likely to support their brand. For example, when a company reduces its carbon footprint or donates to social programs, it gains respect and trust.\n\nSecondly, CSR encourages long-term thinking. Instead of focusing only on short-term profits, responsible businesses consider how their actions affect future generations. This mindset can lead to more sustainable business practices and even innovation.\n\nHowever, it’s important that CSR efforts are genuine. Some companies only use CSR as a marketing tool without making real changes. This can lead to public backlash if people feel they are being misled.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe CSR is essential in today’s world. When done sincerely, it benefits not only the company but also society as a whole. More businesses should view social responsibility as a core part of their mission—not just a side project.\n\n", "task_id": "5949887a-c75f-46ad-95d6-9775e932a1e6", "level_title": "14-Advanced", "label": 0}

This area is rapidly gaining popularity and offers lower rent compared to downtown, allowing us to maintain a physical presence without the hefty price tag.\n\nSimultaneously, we could launch a mobile fitting service. Trained staff would travel to various corporate offices and educational institutions across Centerville, equipped with fabric swatches and advanced, portable measuring tools. This service would cater to busy professionals and students, offering them the convenience of being measured and consulted on-site.\n\nAdditionally, we would invest in an interactive e-commerce platform. Customers could virtually experience our clothing through 3D models and augmented reality features, allowing them to see and feel the cloth digitally. They could input their measurements or schedule a mobile fitting appointment online. This would preserve the personalized service you value while expanding our reach.\n\nThe hybrid model balances cost savings with customer experience, ensuring we stay competitive and connected to our clientele.\n\nBest regards,\nMe", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: One legendary creation that holds a special place in Indian culture is the Ramayana, an epic that has shaped the moral and spiritual fabric of the country for centuries.

This tale is not just a story but a guide to righteous living, emphasizing values like duty, loyalty, courage, and devotion.\n\nThe Ramayana has been passed down through generations in various forms—oral storytelling, written scriptures, dance dramas, and television adaptations. It transcends regional and linguistic boundaries, with versions in almost every Indian language. The characters of Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, Hanuman, and Ravana are deeply embedded in Indian consciousness, often invoked in everyday conversations and moral teachings.\n\nBeyond its religious significance, the Ramayana has inspired countless works of art, literature, and performance. It continues to be celebrated through festivals like Dussehra and Diwali, symbolizing the victory of light over darkness. This timeless creation remains a cornerstone of Indian heritage, uniting people through shared values and cultural pride.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

However, when the body becomes triggered too easily, or there are too many stressors at one time, it can undermine a person’s mental and physical health and become harmful.\n\n", "task_id": "9032f3ed-5da1-4efe-b4dd-c9470bb35d65", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 2}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: \nLanguage Learning: Issues and Challenges\n\n    Learning a new language is an exciting journey, but it comes with several challenges that students often face. One of the biggest difficulties is overcoming the fear of making mistakes. Many learners feel embarrassed when they pronounce words incorrectly or use the wrong grammar, which can discourage them from practicing.\n   Another common issue is the lack of confidence in speaking. Listening and writing might be easier because students have time to think, but speaking requires quick responses. This can cause anxiety and make learners avoid conversations in the target language.\n   Additionally, memorizing vocabulary is a frequent challenge. New words are easy to forget if they are not used regularly. Some students also struggle with understanding different accents, especially when native speakers talk quickly or use slang.\n   Time management is another obstacle. Balancing language learning with work, school, and personal life can be difficult. Without regular practice, progress tends to slow down.\n   Despiste these challenges, there are many strategies to overcome them. Practicing with native speakers, watching movies, listening to music, and using language apps can make learning more effective and enjoyable. The most important thing is to stay motivated, be patient with yourself, and remember that making mistakes is a natural part of learning.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 4}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most fascinating legendary creatures in Indian folklore is the **Naga**, mystical serpent beings that are both revered and feared. Nagas are depicted as powerful, shape-shifting creatures that can take human or serpent form. They are often guardians of treasures, wisdom, and waterways, dwelling in deep underground realms or sacred rivers.\n\nIn Hindu and Buddhist mythology, Nagas symbolize protection and divine power. The most famous among them is **Shesha**, a multi-hooded serpent who forms the bed of Lord Vishnu and holds the universe together. Another well-known Naga, **Vasuki**, is associated with the legendary churning of the ocean in search of divine nectar.\n\nDespite their divine attributes, Nagas can also be vengeful if disrespected. Legends warn against harming snakes, as it is believed to invoke a Naga's wrath, leading to misfortune or drought. Temples dedicated to Nagas can be found across India, where devotees seek blessings for prosperity and protection.\n\nWith their dual nature—both benevolent and terrifying—Nagas remain one of India's most enduring mythical beings, blending spirituality, mystery, and deep cultural symbolism. Their presence in folklore and tradition continues to captivate the imagination of generations.\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

I've been lucky enough to travel around the world and do business with many different people in many different countries.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that‚Äôs popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The Phoenix is a legendary creature that has captivated human imagination for centuries. Originating from ancient Greek mythology, the Phoenix is often depicted as a magnificent bird with vibrant plumage, typically in fiery hues of red, gold, and purple. This mythical bird is renowned for its unique life cycle: it is said to live for several hundred years before it builds a nest of aromatic wood, sets it ablaze, and is consumed by the flames. From the ashes, a new Phoenix arises, symbolizing rebirth, renewal, and the eternal cycle of life.\n\nThe Phoenix's story has been embraced by various cultures, each adding their own nuances to the legend. In Egyptian mythology, the Bennu bird shares similarities with the Phoenix, representing the sun, creation, and resurrection. In Chinese culture, the Fenghuang is a mythical bird that embodies the balance of yin and yang, often associated with the Empress and symbolizing virtue and grace.\n\nThe Phoenix's enduring legacy lies in its powerful symbolism. It serves as a metaphor for overcoming adversity, rising from the ashes of despair, and emerging stronger and more resilient. This timeless legend continues to inspire and resonate with people around the world, reminding us of the potential for renewal and transformation within us all.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I believe companies do have a responsibility to society beyond just generating profits for shareholders. While profitability is essential for any business to survive, the long-term success of a company is closely linked to the well-being of the communities and environments in which it operates. Businesses rely on local infrastructure, a skilled and healthy workforce, and natural resources — all of which can be supported or harmed by corporate decisions.\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) isn't just a moral obligation; it's smart strategy. Consumers today are more informed and often choose brands based on ethical practices. A company that treats its workers fairly, minimizes environmental harm, and supports local communities builds trust and loyalty — key components of lasting success. As Jack@MSU points out, a strong CSR record can enhance customer loyalty and ultimately improve a company’s financial performance.\n\nOn the other hand, leaving social good entirely to government regulation, as some argue, is insufficient. Governments often move slowly or lack resources. Companies, with their vast reach and influence, are in a unique position to drive positive change quickly and innovatively.\n\nUltimately, companies that integrate CSR into their core operations don’t just \"give back\" — they build a stronger foundation for future growth and stability.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

I just got back from the most amazing vacation abroad, and I couldn't wait to tell you all about it.\n\nI spent two unforgettable weeks in Italy. It was my first time traveling to Europe, and honestly, it felt like a dream come true. The trip was packed with history, culture, food, and beautiful landscapes.\n\nMy first stop was Rome. I visited the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and, of course, the Vatican. St. Peter’s Basilica took my breath away. The Sistine Chapel was even more impressive than I imagined.\n\nAfter Rome, I took a train to Florence. The art there was incredible — I saw Michelangelo’s David and many paintings by Botticelli and Da Vinci. Florence felt more peaceful than Rome, and I really loved walking along the Arno River.\n\nThen I went to Venice. It was magical! The canals, the gondolas, the little bridges everywhere — it felt like a movie. I tried to speak a bit of Italian, and people were friendly and helpful.\n\nThe food… wow. I ate pasta every day, tried dozens of gelato flavors, and drank lots of espresso. I even learned how to make pizza in a cooking class!\n\nTraveling abroad really opened my eyes. I met people from all over the world and learned so much about Italian culture. I took hundreds of pictures and kept a travel journal so I wouldn’t forget anything.\n\nI also realized how different life can be in another country. Public transport was so efficient. People took time to enjoy their meals and their days. It made me think about our fast-paced life at home.\n\nOf course, there were challenges too — getting lost, dealing with language barriers, and figuring out train schedules. But honestly, those things made the trip even more memorable.\n\nNow I’m already dreaming about my next trip. Maybe France or Japan?\n\nTraveling abroad was one of the best experiences of my life.

I’d love to travel with you someday — imagine the adventures we could have!\n\nCan’t wait to catch up in person and show you all my photos!\n\nLove,\nF.", "task_id": "48b78e21-bcae-4548-a0e9-1e150343125a", "level_title": "4-Elementary", "label": 5}

Given the current scenario wherein the landlord has already notified that our rest is going to be increased by 25% to $4,500 per month. That's going to eat even more into our profits and that's $54,000 a year which is a huge amount given our current business situation.\nI have an idea and this is based on some research done on the businesses which are dealing with same type of operations but slightly bigger in size. What i have noticed most of them are located in west and they are making huge turnover on year on year basis all this primarily comes from people who are living nearly and from well to do families which gives them an advantage to charge more than normal by tagging international brands logo. The good part is there are lot of places which are placed by the government to support the small scale business like us and on top of that they provide lot of grants to support the daily operations.\n\nThere are schemes which allow small business to produce in bulk and which can further be exported to other nearby countries. I understand that moving to a different place is not really easy but with the kind of trust that we have gained from existing customers i think that will allow us to retain them and the new location strategically becomes important in gaining the new customers.

Maybe try having a calm talk with your manager or HR. Let them know how the lack of feedback is affecting you. Sometimes people just don’t realize how important support is. If things don’t change, maybe it’s time to start looking for a job where your hard work is valued.\n\nAbout Tia, I’m really sorry it’s not going well. Relationships can be confusing and emotional. If you think it’s ending, give yourself time to feel sad. That’s normal. Talk to someone, or write your thoughts down to let it out.

[SEP] Response: Vacations are a time to step away from the routine of daily life, recharge, and explore new places or activities. Whether it's lounging on a sunny beach, hiking through scenic mountains, or discovering the vibrant culture of a new city, holidays provide an opportunity to take a break from work and daily responsibilities.\n\nFor many people, vacations are a chance to reconnect with loved ones, spend quality time with family and friends, or even enjoy some much-needed solo relaxation.

It’s important to plan a vacation that suits your interests—whether it's adventure, leisure, or simply unwinding in nature.\n\nIn today's world, there are endless options for vacation destinations, from exotic tropical islands to charming small towns and bustling metropolitan cities.

People helped one another without expecting anything in return, and kindness was the most common language spoken.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon and the sky turned a soft shade of violet, families gathered for supper, sharing stories, laughter, and dreams.

Nāgas are often depicted as powerful cobras, sometimes with multiple heads, or as half-human, half-snake beings. They’re deeply connected to water and the earth, believed to dwell in underground realms or near rivers, lakes, and oceans.\n\nIn many stories, Nāgas are guardians of treasure and ancient wisdom. They’re neither wholly good nor evil—some protect holy sites and bestow fertility and rain, while others are quick to vengeance if disrespected. The story of Shesha, the king of all Nāgas, is especially famous. According to legend, he carries the world on his thousand hoods and serves as the bed for the god Vishnu.\n\nPeople still honor Nāgas in festivals like Nāga Panchami, where offerings of milk and prayers are made at snake pits and temples. Whether seen as divine protectors or mysterious shapeshifters, Nāgas hold a firm place in the cultural imagination, reminding us of nature’s power and the thin line between the human and the mystical.  \nWould you like to hear about another creature from a different region or culture?

You might be making excuses: “I don’t have the talent, I don’t have the time…” But believe me, you don’t need a special gift to learn a language.

One of the most famous Nāgas is Shesha, the cosmic serpent who serves as the bed of Lord Vishnu and holds the universe on his hoods.\n\nIn Buddhist traditions, Nāgas are also seen as guardians of the Dharma and are said to have offered shelter to the Buddha during a storm.

He is part of a folklore rich in urban legends, many of which take care of the forests and animals, and others, like Cuca, kidnap little children.\nOr even the urban legend of the sack man, who kidnapped naughty little children, was spoken and still spoken by parents as a \"threat\" to their children to behave. Which is a little funny because we always hear that we should behave ourselves in order to receive our Christmas presents, otherwise Santa Claus wouldn't bring them.\nThis shows me that, whether we like it or not, many legends are taken seriously, depending on the region; some are even seen today, especially in regions with farms and dense forests.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}

I agree that the rent increase is a significant concern, and I can see the pressures it will put on our bottom line. Your summary of the situation is spot on, and I appreciate the clarity.\n\nOn one hand, staying in our current location does offer some clear advantages: our customers are used to coming to us, and our downtown location continues to draw in new clients.

I’m worried about further rent hikes that could continue to squeeze our profits.\n\nThe alternative model you propose sounds intriguing, especially with the potential cost savings. Shifting to a lower overhead location and creating a more streamlined, tech-driven approach could help us grow and modernize. However, I share your concerns about losing the in-person showroom experience, which has really been a cornerstone of our brand.\n\nI agree with you that we need another option. Perhaps we could explore a hybrid solution? Maybe we could reduce our physical store hours and rely more on appointment-based meetings or a pop-up showroom while we revamp our website?

This creature comes from Brazilian folklore and is known for living in the forests. The Curupira protects nature and punishes those who harm animals or trees. What makes the Curupira especially interesting is that it has bright red hair and feet that are turned backwards. This makes it hard for people to follow his tracks, as they lead in the wrong direction.\n\nAccording to stories, the Curupira uses tricks to confuse hunters and woodcutters. He creates illusions, strange sounds, and sometimes even leads people to get lost in the forest. Some say he can run extremely fast and disappear suddenly. His main goal is to protect the forest from greedy or careless humans.\n\nThe legend of the Curupira teaches respect for nature. It is told in many parts of Brazil, especially in the Amazon region. Even though it is a myth, many people say they have seen or heard him. The story is passed down through generations and still plays an important role in Brazilian culture today.\n\n\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

The Curupira is a small, forest-dwelling being with flaming red hair and feet that are turned backward.

He is considered a guardian of the forest, protecting animals and trees from those who try to harm them.\n\nThe Curupira is known for using whistles and illusions to scare away people who hunt for sport or cut down trees irresponsibly. In many tales, he punishes greedy individuals by leading them into the depths of the forest, where they become lost and disoriented. Despite his mischievous side, the Curupira only harms those who threaten nature. His presence reflects the importance of respecting the environment and living in harmony with the forest.\n\nThe legend of the Curupira is still popular in Brazil today, especially in the Amazon region.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a topic that sparks diverse opinions. While some argue that a company's sole responsibility is to its shareholders, I believe that companies have a broader responsibility to society.\n\nFirstly, companies significantly impact the communities in which they operate. By engaging in CSR activities, businesses can contribute positively to these communities, fostering goodwill and creating a supportive environment for their operations. This reciprocal relationship benefits both the company and the community, ensuring sustainable growth and development.\n\nSecondly, CSR makes good business sense. Consumers today are more socially conscious and prefer to support companies that demonstrate ethical practices and social responsibility. A strong CSR record can enhance a company's reputation, leading to increased customer loyalty and, ultimately, better financial performance. This alignment of social responsibility with business success creates a win-win situation for all stakeholders involved.\n\nMoreover, as integrated parts of society, corporations must conform to social expectations. This includes addressing environmental concerns, ensuring fair labor practices, and contributing to social welfare. By doing so, companies can build trust and credibility, which are essential for long-term success.\n\nOn the other hand, critics argue that CSR is merely a marketing tool or that it should be the government's responsibility to enforce social welfare. While these points have merit, they overlook the potential for businesses to drive positive change. Companies have resources and influence that can complement governmental efforts, leading to more comprehensive and effective solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the primary goal of a business is to generate profit, this objective should not be pursued in isolation. Companies have a responsibility to society, and by embracing CSR, they can achieve sustainable success while making a meaningful impact on the world.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is at the heart of a long-standing debate: should companies serve society at large, or focus solely on delivering returns to shareholders? On one side, proponents argue that businesses, as embedded parts of communities, must \"give back\"—through fair treatment of workers, investment in the environment, and support for local development. This perspective holds that socially responsible behavior fosters long-term benefits like employee retention, customer loyalty, and brand trust—a virtuous cycle that ultimately enhances financial performance \nen.wikipedia.org\n+15\ninvestopedia.com\n+15\nbfi.uchicago.edu\n+15\n.\n\nEmpirical evidence supports this. Millennials and Gen Z—who now comprise a massive portion of the workforce—are increasingly drawn to employers with strong CSR commitments. Research shows up to 85 % value environmental initiatives, with 75 % willing to change purchasing habits based on corporate values . Moreover, MIT Sloan advocates reframing CSR as \"stakeholder value\"—balancing needs of employees, customers, and communities alongside those of investors . On the opposing side, classic shareholder theory—championed by Milton Friedman—asserts that a corporation's only social responsibility is to its owners: “to increase its profits… so long as it stays within the rules of the game” Friedman argued that social goals should be pursued by individuals or governments,\n\n\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Ancient tales describe it as having the body of a giant snake, the head of a dragon, and glowing, red eyes. It was said to rise from the sea and devour the moon, explaining lunar eclipses in pre-colonial Filipino belief.\n\nAccording to legend, there were originally seven moons in the sky. Enchanted by their beauty, the Bakunawa flew up from the sea and swallowed them one by one. When it tried to consume the last moon, the gods and people made loud noises—banging pots and shouting—to scare it away. This tradition is still echoed in some Filipino communities during eclipses today.\n\nThe Bakunawa is a symbol of power and mystery, embodying both natural wonder and human fear of the unknown. It represents the strong link between nature and myth in Filipino culture, and continues to inspire stories, art, and even modern fantasy literature in the Philippines\n\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Motivating employees is key to keeping the team happy and productive. One of the best ways to do this is by showing appreciation for their hard work. Simple words of thanks or recognizing their efforts in meetings can really boost morale. It’s also important to make sure everyone understands what is expected of them by setting clear and achievable goals. When people know what they’re working toward, they tend to stay more focused and motivated.\n\nCreating an open and supportive environment where employees feel comfortable sharing their ideas and concerns can help build trust and encourage engagement. Offering opportunities for learning and growth keeps things interesting and helps employees feel valued. This could be through training, mentoring, or giving them new challenges that match their skills.\n\nEvery person is different, so try to pay attention to what motivates each individual. Some people enjoy public praise, while others prefer private conversations. Lastly, fostering a positive workplace culture where teamwork and respect are emphasized will make everyone feel like they belong.\n\nIf you want, I’d be happy to share some examples or resources that have worked well for our team.\n\nBest,\n", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 4}

For written language, reading different types of books helps improve vocabulary. In the early stages, for example, children's books are a good way to learn simple nouns, adjectives and conjugations.\nSecondly, you need to be able to express yourself, learn and use vocabulary, and think in ways that are different from your mother tongue.\nIdeally, you should be able to listen to the language you're learning as often as possible, and converse with fluent speakers.\nYou need to be able to overcome the shame you may feel when learning a new language, and admit that you will sometimes make mistakes, so that you can improve by practicing.\nConsistency is one of the keys to progress.

You can create any facts about your city that will support your proposal. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Subject: Urgent Decision on Our Business Location\nHi Josh,\nWe really need to make a decision about our business. Our landlord has sent another notice—next month, the rent will increase by 25% to $4,500 per month. That’s a staggering $54,000 annually!\nI understand that you strongly support staying in our current location. The advantage is that we’re in a fashionable district with a loyal customer base. Being downtown makes it easy for clients to visit us during lunch breaks for measurements. However, our clothing sales aren’t increasing as fast as our expenses, and with Centerville’s rapid growth, more rent hikes seem inevitable.\nOn the other hand, I’m in favor of moving to the south end for production while shifting to a mobile measuring service. We could meet clients in their offices or schools and invest in a better website where customers can browse clothing options and input their measurements. While this would significantly cut costs, we’d lose the showroom experience, which has helped us build personal relationships with clients.\nHonestly, I’m open to other ideas but don’t have a clear solution. Should we talk to more people? We need to act fast. Let’s decide soon!\nThanks,\nKen\n", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 5-Elementary [SEP] Prompt: Write about a movie you recently saw. Give facts and opinions about it. Who starred in the movie? Who directed it? What was it about? Type in the input box. Write 60-100 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Sure! Here's a write-up about a recent movie: \"Dune: Part Two\" (2024)\n\n\n---\n\nTitle: Dune: Part Two\nDirector: Denis Villeneuve\nStarring:\n\nTimothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides\n\nZendaya as Chani\n\nRebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica\n\nAustin Butler as Feyd-Rautha\n\nFlorence Pugh as Princess Irulan\n\nJavier Bardem as Stilgar\n\nStellan Skarsgård as Baron Harkonnen\n\n\n\n---\n\nPlot Summary (Facts):\nDune: Part Two picks up right where the first film left off. Paul Atreides has joined the Fremen after House Atreides is betrayed and overthrown by House Harkonnen. The movie follows his rise as a messianic figure among the Fremen, his growing relationship with Chani, and his eventual confrontation with the forces of the corrupt Emperor and Baron Harkonnen. It's a continuation of the adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic 1965 sci-fi novel Dune.\n\n\n---\n\nDirection & Cinematography (Opinion):\nDenis Villeneuve delivers a visually stunning film with breathtaking desert landscapes and epic battle sequences. The pacing is faster and more intense than the first part, which some viewers may find more engaging. Villeneuve’s signature style—grand scale and emotional restraint—works especially well in this darker, more political second half.\n\n\n---\n\nActing (Opinion):\nTimothée Chalamet gives a more commanding and complex performance in this film compared to Part One. Zendaya, who had limited screen time before, plays a much larger and emotionally resonant role as Chani. Austin Butler is a scene-stealer as the twisted and menacing Feyd-Rautha. The supporting cast, including Florence Pugh and Javier Bardem, adds depth and intrigue.\n\n\n---\n\nThemes (Facts and Opinion):\nThe film explores themes of prophecy, power, colonialism, and destiny. What makes Dune: Part Two compelling is how it complicates the idea of a “chosen one” and challenges the morality of heroism. It’s not just about good vs. evil—it’s about the dangers of believing too deeply in myths.\n\n\n---\n\nFinal Verdict (Opinion):\nDune: Part Two is a bold, thought-provoking, and visually arresting sequel that not only lives up to the hype but elevates the series. It’s a must-watch for fans of science fiction, even if you're not deeply familiar with the book.\n\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want a spoiler-free version or a comparison to the novel!\n\n", "task_id": "bd802cec-aaac-4a24-a654-01d84a6a972d", "level_title": "5-Elementary", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learners often encounter several challenges that can slow down or complicate their progress. One major hurdle is pronunciation and accent—many students find it difficult to reproduce sounds not present in their native language, which may lead to misunderstandings or self-consciousness. Another common issue is vocabulary retention. Learners may understand words when reading but struggle to recall or use them in conversation.\n\nGrammar poses another obstacle. Rules can be complex and full of exceptions, making fluency feel distant. In addition, lack of confidence and fear of making mistakes often prevent students from speaking freely, which limits real-life practice and slows progress.\n\nExternal factors also play a role. Inconsistent practice, limited access to native speakers, or lack of cultural context can all hamper development. Moreover, students may rely too heavily on translation, which can interrupt the natural flow of communication.\n\nDespite these challenges, persistence and the right strategies—such as immersive learning, consistent practice, and conversational exposure—can lead to real improvement. With patience and the right support, fluency is achievable.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: Harry,\n\nMotivating a team is really about creating the kind of environment where people feel valued, heard, and part of something meaningful.\nStart by listening — really listening. When people feel their voices matter, they’re more likely to bring their best selves to work. Don’t underestimate the power of small, genuine recognition. A quick “thank you” or “great job” can go a long way.\nSupport your team’s growth. Take time to understand their goals and offer opportunities to learn or take on new challenges. It shows you care not just about the work they do, but about who they’re becoming.\nAlso, encourage balance. When people feel supported in managing their lives outside of work, they tend to be more focused and energized on the job.\nOn the flip side, try to avoid micromanaging — trust is key. And while bonuses and perks are nice, don’t rely on them too much. Authentic appreciation often motivates more deeply than money alone.\nAt the end of the day, leadership is about relationships. Be present, be fair, and lead with empathy — your team will notice, and they’ll respond.\n\nAll the best,\nAnne", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Read an email from your friend and give advice on some stressful problems he is having. Type in the input box. Write 100-200 words. [SEP] Response: It’s incredibly draining to feel like your efforts aren’t being recognized—especially under new management that doesn’t seem to get what makes a team thrive. When your hard work gets overlooked, it chips away at your motivation and self-worth, even though it shouldn’t.\n\nHere are a few things that might help:\n\nDocument Your Wins: Even if management doesn’t acknowledge your achievements, keep a record of them for yourself. It helps remind you of your value—and if you ever look for a new job, you'll have solid proof of your impact.\n\nBoundaries: Try to avoid letting work bleed too much into your personal identity. That’s tough, but important—your job is what you do, not who you are.\n\nStart Exploring: If the environment is that toxic and it’s not changing, it’s totally valid to quietly start looking at other opportunities. Sometimes just knowing you can leave helps shift the power dynamic internally.\n\nAbout Tia\nBreakups (or even the possibility of one) can knock the wind out of you—especially when it seemed like things were on track. Feeling down about this is completely normal.\n\nGive Yourself Space to Grieve: Even if it was a short relationship, the emotional investment was real. Let yourself feel what you need to feel.\n\nTalk It Out: If you're unsure whether things are really over, try to have a conversation with Tia when emotions are calmer. If it is over, try to focus on the parts of the relationship that helped you grow, even if it’s painful now.\n\nDon't Rush the Healing: There's no deadline to “bounce back.” It’s okay to not be okay for a bit.\n\nYou’ve been strong through a lot—and the fact that you’re reaching out and talking about it shows strength, not weakness. You’re doing your best, and that’s all anyone can ask. If you want to talk more about any of this—or even just distract yourself with something completely different—I’m here for that too.\n\nWant help coming up with an exit strategy for work or thinking through the situation with Tia more?", "task_id": "9032f3ed-5da1-4efe-b4dd-c9470bb35d65", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

You do not need to write the addresses, greetings or the closing. Use a formal tone. Type in the input box. Write 80-100 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: The first department store was created in Paris, in 1850. It was conceived as a big place with a lot of options in products and brands. They wouldn’t sell just a specific product: there you could  find clothes, shoes, jewels, make up and many others things. That concept remained until today. So, if you want to buy many things with good prices, you can choose from one of the thousands in the world.\n\nEvery year, on the day after Thanksgiving, most of this stores have a big sale called Black Friday. On this day, it is possible to buy products with big discounts and you also have the option to buy things online. In 2016, more than 154 million people spent USD 3,3 billion dollars shopping only on the internet.\n\nWalk of fame\n\nEven if you have never visited Los Angeles, you have probably heard about the most famous sidewalk in the world: the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 15-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language is a rewarding but challenging journey that requires dedication and persistence. One of the most common difficulties language students face is pronunciation. Many languages have sounds that do not exist in a student’s native tongue, making it difficult to replicate them accurately.\n\nAnother major challenge is memorizing vocabulary. Words and phrases can be difficult to retain, especially when they are unrelated to a student’s daily life. Using techniques like repetition, flashcards, and association with familiar concepts can help improve retention.\n\nGrammar rules also pose a challenge, as they often differ significantly between languages. Some languages use complex structures, irregular verbs, or different sentence patterns, making it hard for learners to internalize them. Practice and exposure to native speakers can help develop an intuitive understanding of grammar.\n\nAdditionally, many students struggle with confidence when speaking. Fear of making mistakes can prevent learners from practicing, slowing progress. Overcoming this requires a positive mindset and a willingness to take risks.\n\nLastly, immersion plays a crucial role. Without frequent exposure to a language, progress can be slow. Watching movies, reading books, and conversing with fluent speakers can accelerate learning.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning English: A Journey\n\nLearning English is an exciting and rewarding journey. It opens doors to new opportunities, whether in your career, personal life, or travel. The key to mastering the language is consistency and practice. You can start by reading books, watching movies, or speaking with native speakers. It might feel challenging at first, but with time and effort, you will see progress. \nMany learners of English face challenges along the way. One of the most common obstacles is the fear of making mistakes. But remember, mistakes are a natural part of learning! Every time you make an error, you're learning something new. Overcoming this fear is key to gaining confidence.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of learning English is vocabulary. The more words you know, the easier it will be to express yourself. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes – it’s part of the learning process! Listening to English podcasts or music can also help improve your pronunciation and understanding of different accents.\n\nRemember, learning a new language takes patience, so enjoy the process.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Do Companies Owe Society More Than Just Profits?\n\nIn today’s globalized world, companies are more influential than ever—shaping not only economies but also cultures, communities, and the environment. Given this immense reach, it’s reasonable to argue that corporations carry a responsibility beyond simply maximizing profits for shareholders.\n\nCorporations operate within communities, rely on public infrastructure, and benefit from government protections. In return, they should contribute positively—by supporting local initiatives, adopting sustainable practices, and offering fair working conditions. Beyond ethics, this investment pays off: companies known for strong corporate social responsibility (CSR) attract loyal customers, retain committed employees, and build long-term trust. CSR is not just a moral choice; it’s a strategic advantage.\n\nCritics argue that CSR distracts from a company's main mission—profit. Milton Friedman famously stated that a corporation’s only social responsibility is to increase its profits. Some believe CSR efforts are superficial, offering minimal real-world impact compared to company earnings, and that social welfare should be the government’s job.\n\nHowever, this view assumes profit and responsibility are mutually exclusive. In reality, they can and do coexist. CSR, when genuine and well-integrated, enhances a company’s brand, mitigates risks, and fosters innovation.\n\nIn summary, companies do have a responsibility to society—not instead of profits, but alongside them.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Subject: Exploring a New Option for Our Business\nHi Ken and Josh,\nI appreciate both of your perspectives, and after thinking it through, I’d like to suggest a third option that balances familiarity with growth: a hybrid showroom and production space in a lower-cost district nearby.\nInstead of staying downtown at a high rent or moving entirely to a remote production model, we can relocate to a slightly less expensive but still well-trafficked area. This way, we retain a showroom where customers can experience our products firsthand while benefiting from lower overhead costs.\nAdditionally, we can enhance our digital presence, offering virtual style consultations and a smoother online ordering experience. We could also introduce a pop-up service, visiting corporate offices or schools on scheduled days to provide measurement services—combining accessibility with the personal touch we value.\nThis model keeps our relationships intact, embraces online growth, and reduces financial pressure. Let me know your thoughts—happy to discuss further!\nBest,\nKen\nWould you like me to tweak the details or ma\n", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 2-Beginner [SEP] Prompt: Write a paragraph about how your friend stays healthy and in shape. Think of your topic sentence first. Then write other sentences to support the topic sentence examples. Think about questions like: **How often does he/she exercise? What does he/she eat?** Type in the input box. Write 25-50 words. [SEP] Response: 1. Strength Training\nStrength training is one of the most important components of any fitness routine. It focuses on building muscle mass and strength by using resistance exercises. These exercises can involve free weights, resistance bands, or bodyweight exercises. Strength training not only improves muscle tone but also boosts metabolism, increases bone density, and reduces the risk of injury. A typical strength training routine might target different muscle groups each day, such as upper body (chest, arms, shoulders), lower body (legs, glutes), and core (abs, back).\n\n2. Cardiovascular Exercise\nCardio exercises, such as running, cycling, swimming, or even brisk walking, are great for improving heart health and burning calories. Cardiovascular activity increases your heart rate, helping to improve the efficiency of your heart and lungs. It also supports weight loss, as it burns a significant amount of calories. A balanced fitness routine often includes cardio workouts that vary in intensity, from low-intensity steady-state (LISS) cardio, like walking, to high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which alternates between short bursts of intense effort and recovery periods.\n\n3. Flexibility and Mobility Training\nFlexibility exercises, including stretching and yoga, are essential for maintaining mobility and preventing injury. Stretching can improve the range of motion in your joints and help reduce muscle stiffness. Yoga, in particular, combines flexibility with balance, strength, and mindfulness. Incorporating flexibility training into your fitness routine ensures that you maintain a healthy posture, improve circulation, and recover more efficiently from intense workouts.\n\n4. Circuit Training\nCircuit training involves performing a series of exercises in a sequence with minimal rest between each one. This type of workout can be a combination of strength and cardio exercises, and it’s an effective way to work multiple muscle groups while keeping your heart rate elevated. Circuit training is particularly popular for people who want to build strength and endurance while burning fat. It’s also great for those with limited time, as it allows you to get a full-body workout in a short period.\n\n5. Core Workouts\nA strong core is essential for overall body strength and stability. Core exercises focus on the muscles of the abdomen, back, and pelvis. Having a strong core can improve your posture, reduce the risk of back pain, and enhance performance in almost every other fitness activity. Core workouts can include exercises like planks, Russian twists, leg raises, and mountain climbers. A balanced core routine is important for both athletic performance and daily functional movements.\n\n6. Recovery and Rest\nNo fitness routine is complete without proper recovery. Rest days allow your muscles to repair and grow stronger, preventing overtraining and reducing the risk of injury. Active recovery, such as light stretching, yoga, or walking, can also be beneficial in promoting blood flow and easing muscle soreness. Getting enough sleep is also crucial for recovery, as your body needs time to repair and rebuild after intense workouts.\n\n7. Nutrition and Hydration\nWhile not technically part of a fitness routine, proper nutrition and hydration are crucial to supporting your fitness goals. Consuming the right balance of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) can fuel your body before and after workouts, enhance performance, and speed up recovery. Staying hydrated is also important, as dehydration can negatively affect your energy levels, performance, and muscle recovery.\n\n8. Consistency and Progression\nThe most important aspect of any fitness routine is consistency. Regular exercise is key to seeing progress over time. It's also important to gradually increase the intensity of your workouts to continue making progress. This could mean increasing weights, running faster or longer, or adding more challenging exercises to your routine. Progression ensures that you keep challenging your body and avoid hitting a plateau.\n\nConclusion\nA well-rounded fitness routine includes strength training, cardiovascular exercise, flexibility training, and recovery strategies. By focusing on a variety of exercises and ensuring consistency, you can create a routine that improves your overall health and helps you reach your fitness goals. It’s essential to listen to your body, make adjustments as needed, and enjoy the process of getting stronger, healthier, and more", "task_id": "b3285147-d9b6-42f7-9ffb-7482cd450db7", "level_title": "2-Beginner", "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: Subject: A Third Option — A Pop-Up Strategy in Brooksville\n\nHi Josh and Ken,\n\nAfter reading your ideas, I understand the pros and cons of both staying in Centerville and moving to the south side. I’d like to suggest a third option: opening a series of pop-up shops in Brooksville.\n\nBrooksville is a smaller, but growing city just 30 minutes away. Rent is far cheaper—around $1,500 a month in prime areas—and there’s a strong local interest in artisanal and tailored products. Instead of committing to a full relocation or staying with rising costs, we could rotate between different neighborhoods with short-term leases. This lets us test demand, reach new customers, and maintain flexibility.\n\nWe can still use our current showroom for high-end clients and online orders. At the same time, we invest in a better website as Ken suggested. This hybrid model could reduce our risk, expand our reach, and maintain the personalized experience we’re known for.\n\nLet me know what you think. I’d love to explore this more with you both.\n\nBest,\n\n", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

You can dedicate yourself for the amount of time you have at that moment and review the lessons as many times you want, any time you want.\nThe disadvantage from my point of view is the lack of interaction with other students, missing the different accents while learning, which will be the reality in the real world when speaking with different people during meetings or travels.\n\nFor both types of language studying, it will be a big challenge when you don't use the language frequently or not dedicate yourself continuously.
