[SEP] Response: Learning a new language is an exciting journey, but it also presents several challenges. Why do students struggle to stay motivated? One common issue is lack of immediate progress—many learners expect quick results and become discouraged when fluency takes longer than anticipated.

New sounds can be difficult to reproduce, and understanding native speakers—especially when they speak quickly—can feel overwhelming. What techniques can help with this? Listening to music, watching TV shows, and practicing with native speakers can make a big difference.\n\nStudents also often face grammar complexity. Rules may differ from those in their native language, leading to confusion and errors. Instead of memorizing rules, learners can benefit from using the language in real-life situations.A final obstacle is fear of making mistakes. Many learners hesitate to speak for fear of embarrassment. But isn’t making mistakes part of learning?

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Challenges Faced by Language Learners\n\nLearning a new language is an exciting and rewarding journey, but it’s also filled with challenges. As a language learner myself, I’ve experienced firsthand some of the common obstacles students face when acquiring a new language.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges is pronunciation. Many languages have sounds that don’t exist in our native tongue, and mastering them can be difficult. For example, in French, the “r” sound is very different from English, and in Mandarin, the tones can change the meaning of words entirely. For many students, this means struggling with speaking clearly or being understood.\n\nAnother challenge is vocabulary retention. Languages have vast vocabularies, and remembering all the new words can be overwhelming. Often, students may learn a lot in the classroom, but when it comes time to speak, they can’t recall the words they need. This can be frustrating, especially when trying to form complete sentences or express complex ideas.\n\nAdditionally, the fear of making mistakes holds many students back from practicing. Language learners often feel embarrassed if they say something wrong, which can prevent them from taking risks and improving. However, making mistakes is a crucial part of learning, and it’s important to embrace the process.\n\nLastly, cultural differences also play a role. Understanding how the language fits into the culture is essential, as it helps learners understand context, humor, and even body language. Language and culture are deeply intertwined, and learning a language isn’t just about vocabulary and grammar; it’s also about understanding how people communicate.", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: I’ve been studying English for a few years now, and throughout this journey, I’ve faced many challenges.\n\nAs language students, I believe we should focus on expanding our vocabulary. Personally, this has been quite difficult due to the massive number of words in English. However, I’ve finally managed to improve my pronunciation, thanks to consuming content in the language I’m learning. This method really helps you sound more natural and confident, and it also improves your listening skills.\n\nOn the other hand, one of the biggest challenges is the lack of practice opportunities, especially if you live in a Spanish-speaking country. This didn’t come as a big surprise. Without regular exposure to real situations where you need to speak, it’s easy to avoid using the language. This often happens because of the fear of making mistakes, which is another major obstacle to overcome.\n\nIn the end, getting the hang of a language is a long-term process full of ups and downs, but staying motivated and finding creative ways to practice can make a big difference.\n\n", "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is not just an ethical obligation; it is a strategic necessity that benefits both society and businesses alike. Companies operate within communities, rely on employees and resources, and engage with consumers who are increasingly concerned with social and environmental impact. Therefore, businesses have a duty beyond profit-making to contribute positively to society.\nOne key argument for CSR is its direct correlation with consumer trust and brand loyalty. As Jack@MSU pointed out, companies with strong CSR practices tend to build lasting relationships with their customers, which ultimately strengthens their financial performance. Ethical operations, environmental sustainability, and fair employee treatment foster goodwill and create a reputation that attracts stakeholders and talent.\nFurthermore, CSR ensures long-term business sustainability. Sustainable operations and investments in community welfare mitigate risks and enhance resilience, making companies more adaptable to changing social expectations and regulations. As lil@213 mentioned, business and community relationships should be mutually beneficial, ensuring future prosperity for both.\nOn the opposing side, critics argue that CSR can be used as a marketing tool or a superficial attempt at goodwill. JackD_92 highlighted that corporate contributions to social causes are often minuscule compared to overall earnings. While this may be true for some businesses, dismissing CSR entirely overlooks the broader impact of ethical business practices.\n", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a widely debated topic, with some arguing that companies owe duties only to their shareholders, while others believe businesses have broader obligations to society. I support the view that companies do have social responsibilities beyond profit-making.\nCompanies depend heavily on the communities where they operate for resources, labor, and market opportunities. Therefore, as lil@213 suggests, there should be a reciprocal relationship where businesses contribute positively to these communities by supporting sustainable practices and ensuring fair employee treatment. This not only benefits society but also secures the company’s long-term success. Furthermore, as Jack@MSU highlights, consumers increasingly prefer companies with strong CSR records, rewarding them with loyalty that boosts financial performance.\nHowever, critics like theG8T argue that a company’s main responsibility is to maximize profits for shareholders and that CSR efforts are often superficial marketing tactics. Additionally, patty925 points out that social responsibilities should primarily be managed by governments through laws and regulations.\nWhile profit generation is undeniably important, it is not incompatible with social responsibility. Companies that ignore societal expectations risk damaging their reputation and losing consumer trust, which ultimately affects profitability. Moreover, waiting solely on governments limits the positive impact businesses can have; proactive CSR initiatives allow companies to lead change and build stronger stakeholder relationships.\nIn conclusion, corporate social responsibility is both an ethical duty and a practical strategy. Companies should balance profit goals with their social impact to foster sustainable value for shareholders, employees, and communities alike.\n\nWilson\n\n", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: A home loan, also known as a mortgage, is a loan used to purchase a house or other real estate. It allows individuals to finance the purchase of a property over time, rather than having to pay for it in cash upfront. The property itself serves as collateral for the loan, meaning the lender can claim the property if the borrower defaults on the loan payments. \nHere's a more detailed explanation:\nPurpose:\nHome loans are primarily used to buy a house, but they can also be used for constructing a new house, renovating an existing one, or even buying a land plot to build on in the future. \nLoan Amount:\nThe loan amount is usually a percentage of the property's value, with the borrower typically needing to put down a portion of the purchase price as a down payment. \nRepayment:\nBorrowers repay the loan over a specific period, typically 15, 20, or 30 years, with regular payments that include both principal and interest. \nTypes of Home Loans:\nThere are various types of home loans, including fixed-rate mortgages (interest rate remains constant), adjustable-rate mortgages (interest rate can change), and government-backed loans like FHA and VA loans. \nInterest Rates:\nInterest rates on home loans can be fixed or adjustable, and they are a significant factor in the overall cost of the loan. \nLoan Terms:\nThe term of the loan, or the period over which it must be repaid, affects the monthly payments and the total cost of the loan. \nClosing Costs:\nIn addition to the loan amount, borrowers typically have to pay for closing costs, which include fees for the lender, appraisals, and other expenses.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language students face many challenges during their learning journey. One common difficulty is adapting to new grammar rules and vocabulary, which can feed overwhelming. To overcome this, students should try to use the language in daily situations, as it helps build confidence and fluency. Another problem is a lack of practice opportunities. Offering ideas such as joining language can help learners stay engaged and motivated. Students often struggle with pronunciation and listening comprehension. One way to improve these skills is by listening to native speakers through podcasts or music. It's also helpful to record themselves speaking and compare it with native pronunciation. Expressing willingness to practice regularly is key to steady progress. Teachers can also support learners by asking about previous actions, like 'What did you study last week?' or 'Have you practiced speaking recently?' These questions keep students focused and accountable. To summarize what they should do: stay consistent, practice often, and seek out real-world experiences with the language. With time, patience and the right strategies, learners can overcome challenges. ", "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that‚Äôs popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of India’s most fascinating legendary creatures is the Naga, a serpent-like being deeply rooted in mythology. Nagas are depicted as divine or semi-divine creatures with immense power, often associated with wisdom, protection, and transformation. They can appear as full snakes or as human-serpent hybrids, possessing supernatural abilities.\nIn Hindu and Buddhist traditions, Nagas are revered as guardians of treasures, temples, and sacred waters. Some are benevolent, aiding seekers of knowledge, while others, when angered, bring storms and floods. The great Shesha, a massive serpent, is said to support the universe, serving as Lord Vishnu’s resting bed. Manasa, the goddess of snakes, is worshipped for protection against snake bites and fertility blessings.\nDespite their divine associations, Nagas are also feared—legends warn of their wrath when disrespected. Their presence in folklore, temple carvings, and festivals highlights their enduring significance in Indian culture. Whether protectors or adversaries, Nagas remain mystical symbols of power and the hidden forces of nature.\n", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Hi,\nI hope you’re doing well.

When we put our lives in the hands of our Creator, He can solve all our problems and give us strength to keep going.\nBesides prayer and faith, try to take a few minutes each day for deep breathing or meditation to calm your mind. Also, organizing your tasks and taking short breaks can help reduce stress. Another important thing is to take care of your body with healthy eating and a good night’s sleep body and mind need to be in balance. And don’t forget to set aside time for activities you enjoy, whether it’s reading, listening to music, or spending time with loved ones; it renews the spirit.\nRemember, you’re not alone.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Read an email from your friend and give advice on some stressful problems he is having. Type in the input box. Write 100-200 words. [SEP] Response: Dealing with stress effectively is crucial for maintaining both mental and physical well-being. One of the most effective ways to manage stress is through regular physical activity. Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood lifters, and helps reduce levels of the body's stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol.\n\nAnother important strategy is practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques. Activities such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, and yoga can help calm the mind and reduce stress. These practices encourage you to focus on the present moment, which can prevent you from becoming overwhelmed by worries about the past or future.\n\nMaintaining a healthy lifestyle is also key. Eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and avoiding excessive caffeine and alcohol can help your body cope better with stress. Additionally, setting aside time for hobbies and activities you enjoy can provide a much-needed break from daily pressures.\n\nIt's also important to build a strong support network. Talking to friends, family, or a therapist about your stressors can provide emotional relief and practical solutions. Sometimes, just sharing your feelings with someone who listens can make a big difference.\n\nLastly, managing your time effectively and setting realistic goals can prevent stress from becoming overwhelming. Break tasks into smaller, manageable steps and prioritize them. Remember, it's okay to say no to additional responsibilities if you're already feeling stretched thin.", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: I think learning a new language is pretty hard. During my process of learning english I used to share my time in learning other stuff like Japanese or French which made it harder to improve one of the in particular, but to be transparent learning just one language is boring. So while I was improving my english I started to studying Japanese. Why learning a language is hard? The process of learning a new language is very challenging. As you gain more knowledge of the language, the complexity decrements in some aspects but  becomes harder in others  Why is the reason to happen that. ? I have a particular point of view about that. Learning a new language reminds me when I have to learn  several subjects at the same time. From the perspective of complexity it's comparable to learn 5 subjects, which can be classified in five main topics: Speaking, Writing, Listening, Vocabulary and Grammar. The trick is that you need to have a balance when studying  all this topics and the problem is that most of us can't develop the same expertise in all this topics at some specific point of time so you will need to push harder in the topic you are stuck. Just for mentions one aspect, regarding speaking, what I should have done was to only listening before talking because you will avoid to memorize a bad pronunciation, which you will have to forget it later.

The Curupira is a small, human-like being who lives deep in the forest and serves as a guardian of nature.

This strange trait confuses hunters and travelers who try to follow his tracks, leading them in the wrong direction.\n\nThe Curupira punishes those who harm the forest—especially those who hunt for sport, cut down trees unnecessarily, or disrespect animals. He uses illusions, high-pitched whistles, and tricks to drive people away from protected areas. Sometimes, he’s described as mischievous, playing pranks on the greedy or careless, but always with the goal of protecting the natural world.\n\nThe legend of the Curupira has been passed down for generations in Brazil and is still popular today, especially in stories told to children. It reflects the deep cultural value placed on the rainforest and the need to respect and preserve nature.\n\n\n\n\n", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I believe companies do have a responsibility to society beyond simply maximizing profits for shareholders. While generating returns is essential for business sustainability, corporations operate within communities, rely on public infrastructure, and benefit from societal stability. Therefore, they should contribute positively to the environments in which they thrive.\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is not just a moral obligation—it’s also a strategic advantage. Companies that invest in sustainable practices, fair labor conditions, and community development often see increased customer loyalty, stronger brand reputation, and higher employee satisfaction. These factors can directly enhance long-term profitability and resilience.\n\nMoreover, in today’s interconnected world, consumers and investors are more informed and values-driven. They expect transparency and ethical behavior. A company that ignores social and environmental concerns risks public backlash, regulatory scrutiny, and loss of market share.\n\nThat said, CSR should be authentic and integrated into core business strategies—not just a marketing tool. While governments play a key role in regulation, businesses have the resources and influence to lead by example and drive meaningful change.\n\nIn short, companies should balance profit-making with purpose. Doing good and doing well are not mutually exclusive—they are increasingly interdependent in a responsible and sustainable economy.", "label": 5}

I know this decision is tough, but I’d like to suggest a hybrid solution that might give us the best of both worlds.\n\nWhat if we moved just a few blocks east—say, to the Riverbend District? Rent there is about 40% less than downtown, so we’d be paying closer to \\$2,700/month. That area is growing fast with new office spaces, cafés, and a light rail stop opening next spring, which could bring us a fresh wave of professionals and students. We’d still have a physical space for clients to visit, but without the downtown price tag.\n\nAt the same time, we invest in the improved website and mobile fitting service Ken suggested. We can do on-site visits to companies in the downtown core during lunch hours, maintaining our personal touch while expanding reach.\n\nIt’s not as high-end as downtown, but it’s up-and-coming—and we’d save money while evolving our business model.\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\nBest,\n\\[Davi Thomaz]\n", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: *The Challenges of Language Learning*\n\nLanguage students often encounter a myriad of obstacles that can hinder their progress. One of the primary issues is *pronunciation*. Mastering the nuances of a new language's sound system can be daunting, especially when it differs significantly from one's native language.\n\nAnother challenge is *vocabulary acquisition*. Learning new words and expressions can be overwhelming, and retaining them requires consistent practice. Furthermore, *grammar and syntax* can be complex, with many languages having rules and exceptions that are difficult to grasp.\n\n*Cultural differences* also play a significant role in language learning. Understanding the context and nuances of communication in a new culture can be tricky, and learners may struggle to express themselves authentically.\n\nAdditionally, *motivation and practice* are crucial to language learning. Staying motivated and finding opportunities to practice consistently can be a hurdle for many learners.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, language students can benefit from *immersion*, *consistent practice*, and *feedback from native speakers*. By acknowledging these potential issues and staying committed to the learning process, language learners can make steady progress and achieve fluency.", "label": 5}

You can create any facts about your city that will support your proposal. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: From_\nToAll\nJosh,\n\nWe really have to make a decision about our business. Our landlord just wrote me another letter about the rent. Next month, it will be raised 25% to $4,500 per month. That's going to eat even more into our profits. I mean, Josh, that's $54,000 a year!\n\nI'm going to summarize our discussions here. I know that you are strongly in favor of just staying where we are and paying the higher rent. The obvious disadvantages of that are that our sales of clothing are increasing more slowly than our expenses AND with the rapid growth in Centerville, we can expect further rent increases in the coming months. The big pro for staying is that we're in a fashionable district where long-term customers know us.

Give an example to support your opinion, and end your post with an action step, suggestion or recommendation. Type in the input box. Write 50-90 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: My Opinion About TV Shows\n\nIn my opinion, TV shows are one of the most popular and powerful forms of entertainment in the world today. They have the ability to make us laugh, cry, think, and even learn. With so many genres available—like drama, comedy, reality, crime, and science fiction—there is something for everyone to enjoy.\n\nOne of the reasons I like TV shows is because they help us escape from everyday stress. After a long day at school or work, watching a good series can be relaxing and fun. I personally enjoy watching dramas and documentaries because they combine storytelling with real-life issues. Shows like Stranger Things, Breaking Bad, or The Crown are not only entertaining but also make us reflect on human behavior and society.\n\nOn the other hand, I think some reality TV shows focus too much on gossip and competition, which can be harmful or superficial. They often show people arguing, fighting, or acting in extreme ways just to get attention. While they may be fun for some, I believe it’s important to balance entertainment with meaningful content.\n\nTV shows also influence culture and language. Sometimes we start using words or expressions we hear in shows, or we get curious about the culture, places, or history they show. For example, many people learned about British royalty through The Crown, or about science through Breaking Bad in an indirect way.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe TV shows are an important part of modern life. When chosen carefully, they can educate, inspire, and entertain. It's up to us to watch them responsibly and make smart choices about what we consume.\n\n", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: My Opinion on Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is no longer just a trend—it’s a necessity. In my opinion, businesses have a duty not only to their shareholders but also to society and the environment. Companies that invest in CSR show that they care about more than just profit, and this can build strong, lasting relationships with customers and communities.\n\nFirstly, CSR helps create a positive public image. When companies support causes like environmental protection, education, or fair labor practices, people are more likely to support their brand. For example, when a company reduces its carbon footprint or donates to social programs, it gains respect and trust.\n\nSecondly, CSR encourages long-term thinking. Instead of focusing only on short-term profits, responsible businesses consider how their actions affect future generations. This mindset can lead to more sustainable business practices and even innovation.\n\nHowever, it’s important that CSR efforts are genuine. Some companies only use CSR as a marketing tool without making real changes. This can lead to public backlash if people feel they are being misled.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe CSR is essential in today’s world. When done sincerely, it benefits not only the company but also society as a whole. More businesses should view social responsibility as a core part of their mission—not just a side project.\n\n", "label": 0}

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi Harry,\n\nWelcome to your new role! I know that managing a team can be challenging, especially when it comes to keeping people motivated. So, I’d like to share a few ideas that might help you lead effectively.\n\nFirst of all, it’s essential that employees feel the company’s success is also their own. When there’s a clear link between individual effort and collective results, motivation increases. Also, show genuine interest in each team member’s career path. Provide training opportunities and act as a mentor whenever possible.\n\nAnother key point is promoting a healthy work-life balance. Recognizing that everyone has responsibilities and interests outside of work shows empathy and builds commitment. Listen to your team carefully – even when they’re venting. Just feeling heard can make a big difference.\n\nOn the other hand, avoid behaviors that demotivate, such as taking credit for others’ work, raising your voice, or ignoring your team’s efforts. Small gestures of recognition and respect can have a huge impact on the working atmosphere.\n\nBest of luck in this new chapter!\nAll the best.", "label": 5}

This is something that will only drive your employees away from you, and they will be afraid to tell you about problems and difficulties.\n2) Don't be bossy.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: In my opinion, social responsibility is a fundamental objective for companies because they have a big impact on society. In fact, even if companies pursue the higher earning possibile they don't have to forget the importance of sustainability for our community, which could be put into practice by starting from fair conditions for the employees and going on with operations which respct high social standards. Therefore, I surely agree with the quotes in favour of CSR. In particular, I would like to mention the following sentence posted by Jack@MSU: \"Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty\". This is totally true! Consumers notice and appreciate companies with a good CSR record and are more pleasant to buy items or services from them. On the other hand, as I said before we also have to take into consideration that the real objective of business is to increase its business. Therefore, corporations would probably invest just a little sum of its earning on social projects. Also, this fact could lead corporations to sponsor CSR just in order to appear \"a great company\" in front of the society. Nevertheless, this issue would risk to discourage the development and spreading of CSR between the companies, with negative consequences for all world benefits. On the contrary, it is necessary to take one step at a time and to appreciate what nowadays companies are doing to improve their CSR. Hopefully, in the future such an importance to respect social expectations will be regulated by law and implemented by all companies.", "label": 4}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility is a key element of each organization, CSR is showing how is the organization cares about the community it works for, that mean each company should assign part of its income to facilitate local community needs. This can be done in form of building hospitals, streets and schools, it can be also in form of recruiting local community people and giving them the required-on job training. Normally these organizations which have a very good CSR system will get the required support and fund from the government which is at the end of the day is a benefit for the company itself. \n\nSome people don't believe that companies should have a CSR system as it costs a lot of money and reduce the profitability of each organization. When it comes to the local community the company work for then there is no point these companies get a lot of profit from doing business locally and after that they don't share some of their profit for their community. I believe when the local people think those companies' doing business in their area and have a very good CSR reputation, then local people will normally doing business with these comapnies and buy from them their needs.", "label": 3}

This area is also attracting a lot of foot traffic due to its scenic riverside views and the recent opening of several popular cafes and restaurants.\n\nBy moving to Riverside, we can maintain a physical showroom where customers can experience our products firsthand. Additionally, we can leverage the growing popularity of the area to attract new clients. We can also enhance our online presence to complement the physical store, allowing customers to browse and order online while still offering personalized service through in-store consultations.\n\nThis option provides a middle ground, balancing cost savings with the need to maintain a strong customer relationship.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]", "label": 5}

I’ve been thinking about a third possibility that might give us the best of both worlds.\n\nWhat if we move to the new creative co-working space in East Bangalore’s Indiranagar district? It’s become a hub for boutique brands and startups, and the rent is significantly lower—around $2,800/month. The space includes a small showroom area and shared amenities, so we can still meet clients in person and showcase our fabrics. Plus, it’s just a 10-minute walk from the metro, making it accessible for our downtown clientele.\n\nWe could also host monthly pop-up events in high-traffic areas like UB City or Church Street to maintain visibility and attract new customers. Combined with Ken’s idea of improving our online presence and offering office visits, this hybrid model could reduce costs while keeping our personal touch.\n\nLet me know what you think—happy to explore this further!\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]", "label": 5}

According to legend, the only way to capture him is by throwing a sieve or a rosary into his whirlwind, forcing him to drop his cap and lose his powers. Some stories claim he can be tamed if someone steals his cap, turning him into a loyal servant.Originating from Indigenous Tupi-Guarani myths and later influenced by African and European folklore, the Saci represents Brazil's rich cultural blend.

[SEP] Response: TRAINING COMPANY EVALUATION REPORT\nMasako Nakakuki, 21st June 2025\n\nConsidering the necessary skills and benefits for our employees, I’ve evaluated two leading training companies, Skills Pro and TrainQuick, to see which company would be better fit our company.\n\nFirst, I’ve conducted a quick survey among the HR team who took a trial class of the two companies.\nI asked them to rate from five stars to one star as follows from various perspectives.  I’ve also added some notable comments as subordinate factors.\n\n★★★★★\tExcellent\n★★★★☆\tGood\n★★★☆☆\tFair\n★★☆☆☆\tNeed Improvement\n★☆☆☆☆\tNot Satisfied\n\nSkills Pro:\nCost\t\t★★★☆☆\nFlexibility\t★★★☆☆\nCourse Level\t★★★★★\nCurriculum\t★★★★☆\nVariations\t★★★★☆\nNote: While the cost by itself is less competitive, the course level and class variations are higher than expected.  It’s fairly challenging to increase motivation to finish the course.  Another plus point is that they are planning to expand the course starting next year.  In this sense, the cost matches the quality and their future possibilities.\n\nTrainQuick:\nCost\t\t★★★★★\nFlexibility\t★★★★☆\nCourse Level\t★★★☆☆\nCurriculum\t★★★☆☆\nVariations\t★★☆☆☆\nNote: Their strength are the low cost and flexibility.  While the courses at Skills Pro are fixed, they are open to customize their courses based on our needs which is appreciative.  However, their course level doesn’t meet our expectations so that some employees are less confident with their skills when being mixed with people from other branches who are taking training of other company.\n\nSummary and Recommendations\nOverall, Skills Pro appears to be the more beneficial option for our company despite its relatively higher cost.  The overall satisfaction among HR members who participated in the Skills Pro trial class was significantly higher than that of TrainQuick.  \nGiven their strong curriculum, high course level, and promising growth potential, I highly recommend adopting Skill’s Pro’s training programs to support the continued development of our employees.", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 15-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: With language in constant evolution, it is always good to find ways to make sure that there is no misunderstanding. For that you need different communication strategies. Suppose that you have given instructions to a fellow employee and you want to check that he or she has understood you. A common strategy is to ask: ‘Did you understand?’, but this is a poor strategy, because the social pressure to respond ‘Yes, I did’ is so high that we often do not get a true response to the question. A better way to check is to ask something like: ‘Can you explain that back to me?’ or ‘So now I’ve explained, you show me what to do.’\n\nUse open and closed questions when appropriate\n\nSometimes, when you are pushed for time and just want to confirm something, a simple closed question will suffice. For example, if you want to start a talk and are checking to see if the audience is ready, asking ‘Are you all ready to begin?’ will elicit a simple yes/no answer. On the other hand, asking ‘How do you feel about beginning?’ gives audience members more of an option to delay, or to give rambling answers – not good when you are pushed for time.\n\nIf, however, your goal is to get detailed information from someone, an open question trumps a closed one each time. Say you’ve just delivered some important information and you want one of your colleagues to reinforce your message to the team – asking ‘Dave, can you explain to the group how you dealt with a similar problem last week?’ will elicit a detailed response, whereas asking, ‘Dave, would you agree?’ lets your colleague off the hook with a simple yes/no answer.\n\nDepersonalizing\n\nSome listeners can be easily wrong-footed by too much use of the second person ‘you’. If you are concerned about members of your team arriving late for work, but you don’t want to single anyone out, it might be better to depersonalize the situation by saying: ‘Remember that we all need to be in the office by 8.30 every morning.’ Choosing this strategy, instead of saying ‘You all need to be in the office by 8.30 every morning’ ensures that no one feels ‘picked on.’\n\nInvolving the audience\n\nThis sounds like a basic concept, but it’s one that most speakers forget, both when talking one-to-one and in large groups. Rambling on and on is a surefire way to encourage your audience to drift off and stop paying attention to what you are saying. Keep your audience focused on your message by maintaining eye contact. If you are addressing a room of people, look around the room regularly. Try to elicit nods or other gestures of understanding. If you don’t see any, it may be time to ask a comprehension question.", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 14-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Your boss has asked you to do an internet search. Read the email and the search results then reply giving the two best places to go and your reasons. You can include the links in your reply. Type in the input box. Write 80-100 words. [SEP] Response: \n\nHaving a daily routine is essential for maintaining a healthy and balanced life. A well-planned routine helps people manage their time more effectively, reduces stress, and increases productivity. When we follow a routine, we create a sense of structure and purpose in our lives. For example, waking up at the same time every day helps regulate our internal clock and improves our sleep quality.\n\nA good routine includes time for work, rest, physical activity, and personal interests. Setting aside moments for exercise, healthy meals, and relaxation can greatly improve our mental and physical health. Moreover, routines help us develop positive habits and eliminate bad ones. Over time, simple actions like reading before bed or walking in the morning can have lasting benefits.\n\nChildren and adults alike benefit from routines. For children, routines provide stability and help them feel safe. For adults, routines can bring a sense of control during busy or stressful times. While flexibility is important, having a basic daily structure allows us to be more organized and focused.\n\nIn conclusion, daily routines are powerful tools that support our well-being. By creating and following a routine, we build discipline and create space for growth and happiness.\n\n", "label": 0}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: After evaluating two potential training companies, TrainQuick and Skills Pro, for our employee training program, I recommend proceeding with Skills Pro despite its higher cost. This decision is based on a detailed analysis of both companies.\nTrainQuick offers affordable and flexible training options. However, it hasn´t been well-received by employees in our other branch. A significant drawback is that employees are uncomfortable with being mixed with participants from different branches.\nSkill Pro, on the other hand, is more expensive but has demonstrated higher quality and effectiveness. While the course content has been described as challenging, employees who enroll in the courses tend to complete them successfully. Moreover, Skills Pro is planning to expand its course offerings, which could provide additional value and opportunities for our staff´s development.\nIn conclusion, selectin Skills Pro aligns with our commitment to providing high-quality training for our employees.

Here's a general 150+ word passage for you:\n\nThe beauty of nature often lies in the simple moments we encounter every day. From the soft rustle of leaves in the wind to the gentle ripples of a lake’s surface, nature offers us a sense of calm and grounding. Often, in the hustle and bustle of daily life, we forget to stop and appreciate these small wonders. Taking a walk through a park or just sitting by a window, watching the sun set, can be a reminder of the world’s unhurried pace. Nature doesn’t rush; it simply exists, thriving in its own rhythm. Whether it's the way flowers bloom with no expectation or how animals go about their day, untouched by time, it reminds us that sometimes, it's okay to slow down. In these moments, we can find clarity and peace, reconnecting with the world around us and with ourselves.\n\nLet me know if you’d like me to adjust or expand on any part!\n", "label": 0}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility is a widely debated topic, with some believing companies should care for society while others think their only focus should be profits. I believe companies have a responsibility to society.\nFirstly, companies significantly impact their communities. They use local resources and labor, so it’s fair they give back through supporting schools, healthcare, or environmental projects. Treating employees well also helps; happy employees are more productive and less likely to leave.Additionally, CSR makes business sense because consumers care about it. Many people prefer to buy from companies that act responsibly. A strong CSR record wins customer loyalty, boosts reputation, and increases sales. This means everyone benefits: the company profits and society sees positive changes.\nCritics argue that companies should focus solely on profits, and that it’s the government's job to address social issues. While governments do play a crucial role, companies can still take proactive steps. Legal regulations might not cover everything needed to improve society, and companies can address these gaps effectively.\nIn conclusion, CSR is not just about charity; it's about strategically contributing to society while ensuring long-term company success. Companies that engage in CSR can grow sustainably and create a better world for their employees, customers, and communities.", "label": 5}

You can create any facts about your city that will support your proposal. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: I’ve been thinking hard, and I might have a third option that blends both of our approaches while minimizing the biggest risks.\n\nWhat if we convert our current location into an “appointment-only” studio?\nWe stay in the downtown space for now, but reduce overhead by:\n\t•\tCutting back open hours and switching to appointments for fittings, consultations, and pickups.\n\t•\tReducing floor staff and moving part of the tailoring operation to a smaller, cheaper workspace on the south end of town.\n\t•\tLaunching the online platform like I mentioned — letting clients browse styles, submit measurements, and even schedule appointments online.\n\nThat way, we preserve our downtown visibility and high-end reputation without having to absorb the full cost of a retail-style operation. Long-term, if the online/off-site model works well, we can decide to fully relocate or stay small and lean in the current space.\n\nThis hybrid setup gives us room to test the new model without making a drastic, all-or-nothing change. We’d still have the personal service component, but begin moving toward a more scalable and cost-effective structure.\n\nLet me know what you think.

The preliminary \"offer\" from the government's side was an initial assessment of his potential value, perhaps skepticism about his eccentric methods, and the challenge of proving himself.\n\nDuring negotiations, Nash demonstrated his unique ability to identify patterns and codes that others missed. He proved his genius by cracking a seemingly impossible code, effectively negotiating for trust and the critical security clearance needed for his work. The process involved him showcasing his intellectual prowess and unconventional thinking.\n\nThe final deal was Nash gaining full access to the classified projects, becoming an integral, albeit unofficial, part of the decryption team. His brilliance was recognized and utilized, allowing him to contribute significantly to national security efforts based on his demonstrated abilities.", "label": 4}

Here are some key tips:\n\nEat a Balanced Diet\n• Focus on whole foods—fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n• Limit processed foods, added sugars, and excessive salt.\n• Stay hydrated: aim for about 8 glasses (2 liters) of water per day, more if you’re active or in a hot climate.\n\nBe Physically Active\n• Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week (e.g., brisk walking, cycling) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity (e.g., running, HIIT).\n• Include strength training twice a week to build and maintain muscle.\n• Incorporate everyday movement—take stairs, walk during calls, stretch regularly.\n\nPrioritize Sleep\n• Adults generally need 7–9 hours of quality sleep each night.\n• Maintain a consistent sleep schedule—even on weekends.\n• Create a calming bedtime routine: reduce screen time, dim the lights, and avoid caffeine late in the day.\n\nManage Stress\n• Practice relaxation techniques: deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or mindfulness.\n• Set aside time for hobbies, social connection, and fun.\n• Learn to say “no” and recognize when you need a break.\n\nMaintain Regular Checkups\n• Visit your doctor, dentist, and optometrist routinely for screenings and preventive care.\n• Monitor your health metrics—blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol—and act early if something’s off.\n\nAvoid Harmful Habits\n• Don’t smoke or use tobacco.\n• Limit alcohol intake: if you drink, do so in moderation.\n• Protect your skin: use sunscreen, wear a hat, and avoid excessive sun exposure", "label": 0}

[SEP] Response:  \n\nTo: [Boss's Name] From: [Your Name] Date: [Today's Date] Subject: Recommendation for Training Company\n\nAfter a thorough evaluation of two training companies, TrainQuick and Skills Pro, I recommend Skills Pro for our training needs. Below are the details supporting this recommendation:\n\nTrainQuick:\n\nCost: TrainQuick is a cheaper option and offers flexible scheduling.\nUsage: Despite its affordability, TrainQuick is not widely used in our other branch.\nFeedback: Employees have expressed dissatisfaction with being mixed with participants from other branches during training sessions.\nSkills Pro:\n\nCost: Skills Pro is more expensive compared to TrainQuick.\nCourse Content: The course content has been described as challenging.\nSuccess Rate: Despite the difficulty, participants who enroll in Skills Pro courses often complete them successfully.\nExpansion Plans: Skills Pro is planning to expand its course offerings, which could provide additional benefits to our employees.\nConsidering the feedback and success rates, Skills Pro appears to be the more effective choice for our training needs. The challenging content and higher completion rates suggest that Skills Pro provides a more rigorous and beneficial training experience. Additionally, their plans for expansion indicate a commitment to continuous improvement and adaptation to our needs.\n\nI recommend proceeding with Skills Pro for our training programs to ensure our employees receive high-quality and effective training.\n\nLavanya Kadadas", "label": 5}

This creature is deeply rooted in Brazilian folklore and is often depicted as a mischievous and protective spirit of the forest. The Curupira is typically portrayed as a small, red-haired humanoid with backward feet, making it difficult to track its movements. According to the legend, the Curupira uses its supernatural abilities to defend the forest against those who seek to exploit it, such as hunters and loggers.\n\nThe backward feet are a distinctive feature, and they symbolize how the Curupira confounds anyone who tries to follow it, leading them in circles until they are lost. It is said to emit loud, eerie whistles and mimic the sounds of animals or humans to mislead intruders. The Curupira's primary role is to preserve the forest and its creatures, punishing those who harm nature or disrespect its sanctity. Though it can be a trickster, the Curupira is also seen as a guardian of the environment, embodying the deep connection between the land and the people who live on it. This creature is a powerful symbol of Brazil's rich folklore and its natural heritage.\n", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Students learning a new language often face various challenges that can make the process difficult. One of the main problems is **motivation**. Why do you think some students lose interest in learning after a few months? This could be due to slow progress or unrealistic expectations. Another obstacle is **vocabulary retention**. How do students remember and use new words consistently? This requires constant practice and exposure. Additionally, many students struggle with **grammar rules**. Why is it so difficult to master them? The complexity of sentence structures and irregularities in different languages can cause confusion.\n\nA major hurdle is also **speaking confidence**. Do students find it intimidating to speak in a new language? Fear of making mistakes or sounding awkward often holds them back. **Listening comprehension** can be another tough area. Do students have difficulty understanding native speakers, especially when they speak fast? This can lead to frustration and lack of progress.\n\nFinally, students often face the challenge of **cultural differences**. How can understanding the culture enhance language learning? Without cultural context, the language might not make sense in certain situations.\n\nIn summary, motivation, vocabulary, grammar, speaking confidence, listening skills, and cultural understanding are all significant challenges that language learners must overcome.

These creatures are believed to have multiple tails, with legends stating that a Kitsune grows an additional tail every hundred years, up to nine tails, which indicates immense wisdom and power.\n\nTheir shape-shifting abilities allow them to take on the appearance of beautiful young women, old men, or even children, often using these forms to interact with humans for various purposes, ranging from playful mischief to earnest assistance. Kitsune are also known for their ability to create illusions, possess humans, and even control fire, which is sometimes represented as a glowing orb or foxfire.\n\nThe Kitsune remain a popular figure in Japanese culture, inspiring countless stories, artworks, and modern media, symbolizing both the mysterious and enchanting aspects of the natural world.", "label": 5}

Instead of only staying downtown or moving everything to the south end, we could try something different. We can open a small showroom in the Riverside Market district. This area is getting popular, and the rent is much lower—about $1,800 each month. There are many people visiting because of the new food hall and weekend events.\n\nWe can keep making our clothes in the south end to save money. But with a showroom in Riverside Market, customers can still come in, see and touch our clothes, and get measured. We can do fittings by appointment, so it will be easy to manage.\n\nThis plan lets us keep personal service for our customers, but we do not have to pay high rent downtown. Also, Riverside Market has many young people who might like our clothes. We can also have special events to show our clothing to new customers.\n\nPlease tell me what you think about this idea.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature that fascinates me is the ibizan lobisomem, or werewolf, from Portuguese folklore. While the concept of a werewolf exists in many cultures, the Portuguese version has unique characteristics. Traditionally, the lobisomem is said to be a man cursed to transform into a wolf-like creature on certain nights, especially during a full moon. The curse often passes through generations, typically affecting the seventh son in a family.\n\nUnlike the Hollywood version, the Portuguese lobisomem is not always violent. In some tales, he simply roams the countryside in sorrow, avoiding people and trying to hide his condition. The transformation is often seen as a punishment for sins or a family curse, and the only way to break it is through specific rituals or acts of redemption.\n\nWhat makes this creature interesting is how it reflects rural Portuguese beliefs about guilt, transformation, and redemption. It’s not just a monster—it’s a symbol of inner struggle and the hope for forgiveness. These stories were especially popular in the northern regions of Portugal and are still told today in some villages, keeping the legend alive.", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Navagunjara is a fascinating creature from the Indian epic the Mahabharata, especially in the version told in Odisha called the Sarala Mahabharata. This mythical creature is made up of parts from different animals, symbolizing the diversity and unity of life.\n\nNavagunjara has the head of a rooster, the neck of a peacock, the back of a bull, the waist of a lion, the tail of a snake, and three legs from an elephant, a tiger, and a deer. It also has one human arm holding a lotus or a wheel. Each part represents different qualities, coming together to form one amazing being.\n\nIn the story, Navagunjara appears to Arjuna, one of the Pandava brothers, during his exile. While meditating, Arjuna sees this strange creature and is initially surprised by its unusual shape. However, he soon realizes that Navagunjara is actually Lord Krishna in disguise, testing his faith and understanding. Recognizing its divine nature Arjuna bows in respect understanding the deeper meaning of its form.\n\nThe story of Navagunjara teaches a lesson about unity in diversity showing how different elements can come together in harmony. This idea fits with the larger themes in the Mahabharata which celebrates the complexity and interconnectedness of life.\n\nIn Odisha, artists often depict Navagunjara in Pattachitra, a traditional style of painting on cloth. These artworks capture the creature's unique form with detailed and colorful designs reflecting its spiritual significance. Through these artistic expressions, the legend of Navagunjara continues to inspire people to think about the mysteries of life and the unity that connects everything.\n\nThe tale of Navagunjara is an important part of Odisha's rich storytelling tradition, blending myth, art, and philosophy into stories that share timeless wisdom and cultural identity.", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Ayrton Senna's story is one of the most thrilling and tragic in the world of motorsport. Born in São Paulo in 1960, Senna began his career in karting and quickly stood out, showing an exceptional talent for racing. In 1984, he made his Formula 1 debut with Toleman, but it was during his time with Lotus, McLaren, and ultimately Williams that he became a legend.\n\nSenna was known for his incredible skill in wet conditions, his fierce determination, and his relentless pursuit of perfection. He won three World Championships (1988, 1990, and 1991) and claimed 41 Grand Prix victories, becoming an icon of the sport.\n\nIn addition to his talent, Senna was deeply committed to social causes. His foundation, created in 1994, continues to support educational projects in Brazil, reflecting his desire to improve people's lives.\n\nTragically, Senna’s career was cut short on May 1, 1994, during the San Marino Grand Prix. A fatal crash at the Tamburello corner claimed his life, leaving the motorsport world in shock. Even after his death, Ayrton Senna remains an inspiration to millions of fans and drivers, remembered not just for his talent but for his passion and courage.\n\nSenna is more than just a name; he is a symbol of overcoming challenges, dedication, and love for the sport.

[SEP] Response: **Subject: A Third Option for Consideration**\n\nHi Josh and Ken,\n\nI’ve been thinking about our situation and came up with a third possibility. What if we move to a more affordable location, but stay close enough to downtown to maintain customer access while avoiding the dramatic rent hikes? There’s an emerging area on the east side of Centerville that’s attracting a lot of professionals and families. It’s a bit quieter, but it’s starting to show signs of gentrification with a steady increase in foot traffic, and the rent is much lower—around \\$3,200 per month. This would save us \\$1,300 a month, or \\$15,600 annually, without sacrificing visibility.\n\nWe could set up a smaller showroom for a more personalized experience, but also implement an appointment system where customers book fittings, making it more efficient. With the extra savings, we could invest in a better online presence and even offer virtual fittings, where customers upload photos and measurements. The best part is, the area is close enough to downtown to not lose our loyal clientele, and we’d still have room to grow.\n\nLet’s discuss this in more detail. It might be a good middle ground!\n\nBest,\nVinicius\n", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a topic that sparks diverse opinions. On one hand, proponents argue that companies have a duty to contribute positively to society. They believe that businesses, as integral parts of the communities they operate in, should engage in sustainable practices and support local initiatives. This perspective emphasizes a symbiotic relationship where both the company and the community benefit. For instance, sustainable operations ensure long-term viability, while fair employee benefits lead to higher productivity and lower turnover rates. Additionally, companies with strong CSR records often enjoy enhanced customer loyalty, which translates to better financial performance and broader societal benefits.\n\nOn the other hand, critics of CSR argue that the primary responsibility of a business is to its shareholders. They cite Milton Friedman's assertion that the main goal of a corporation is to maximize profits. From this viewpoint, CSR activities are seen as distractions from the core business objectives. Critics also point out that the contributions made by corporations to social causes are often minimal compared to their overall earnings, suggesting that CSR can be a superficial marketing tool rather than a genuine effort to effect change. Furthermore, they argue that it is the government's role to create and enforce regulations that benefit the public, not the corporations'.\n\nIn conclusion, while CSR can enhance a company's reputation and foster customer loyalty, it is essential to balance these activities with the primary goal of profit maximization. Ultimately, the debate hinges on whether businesses should prioritize societal benefits alongside shareholder interests or focus solely on financial performance.", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Do you believe companies have a responsibility to society? Or do you think a company's only responsibility is to its shareholders? We invite you to join this discussion by posting your opinion on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nFor CSR\n\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925", "label": 0}

Our landlord just wrote me another letter about the rent. Next month, it will be raised 25% to $4,500 per month. That's going to eat even more into our profits. I mean, Josh, that's $54,000 a year!\n\nI'm going to summarize our discussions here. I know that you are strongly in favor of just staying where we are and paying the higher rent. The obvious disadvantages of that are that our sales of clothing are increasing more slowly than our expenses AND with the rapid growth in Centerville, we can expect further rent increases in the coming months. The big pro for staying is that we're in a fashionable district where long-term customers know us. We're right downtown, so customers can come in on their lunch breaks to be measured for a suit or other high-end clothing.\n\nYou know that I favor going to a completely different model. We move to the south end of town for making the clothes, but create a system where we meet people in their offices or schools to measure them for new clothes. We also open up a much better webpage than what we have now so that customers can view our clothing options and enter their measurements. Incredible cost savings! The con of that is that we lose the showroom, where customers can just come in and look at the possibilities, feel the cloth and talk to us about what would be appropriate for them. Far less personalized service, which has helped us build close relationships with our customers.\n\nHonestly, I'd like another option, but I'm out of ideas. Should we talk to more people? I'm up for anything, but we really DO need to make a decision!\n\nThanks!\n\nKen", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: For CSR\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n\nAgainst CSR\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.", "label": 5}

Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nFor CSR\n\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925", "label": 0}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that‚Äôs popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In Spanish folklore, gamusinos are legendary creatures said to inhabit remote forests, mountains, and rural areas. Descriptions of gamusinos vary widely, as they are intentionally vague and elusive—some say they are small, furry animals with glowing eyes, while others claim they are invisible or shape-shifting beings. What unites all versions is that no one has ever truly seen one, making them a perfect subject for playful storytelling.\n\nThe legend of the gamusino has spread across Spain through oral tradition and rural humor. A common joke involves sending unsuspecting city folk or children on a “gamusino hunt,” fully aware that the creature doesn’t exist. This harmless prank became a cherished tradition, especially in summer camps and scout groups, where it fostered bonding and sparked creativity.\n\nOver time, the gamusino has become a symbol of whimsical folklore and the power of collective storytelling. Its expansion across Spain reflects not just regional creativity, but also a shared cultural love for mystery, humor, and the joy of believing in the unbelievable.\n\nThe creature’s name varies by region: mush in Extremadura, gambusino in Andalusia, gambozin in Portugal, and donyet, gambosi, or gambutzi in Catalonia and Valencia—where it refers to a “dwarf so tiny it’s barely visible.” Even the Royal Spanish Academy (RAE) acknowledges the gamusino, defining it as an “imaginary animal, whose name is used to trick learner hunters.”\n", "label": 5}

Since you'd like it to be quite lengthy—between 200 and 300 lines—I’ll write a full-fledged message that reads like a heartfelt, encouraging letter, offering guidance, insight, and emotional support.\n\n---\n\n**📧 Email from Your Friend (Fictional):**\n\n*Subject: I Don’t Know What To Do Anymore*\n\nHey,\n\nI hope you don’t mind me reaching out like this. I just really needed someone to talk to. Lately, I’ve been feeling completely overwhelmed. Work’s been insane—I’ve got deadlines piling up, my manager keeps shifting priorities, and I can’t seem to catch a break. On top of that, things at home haven’t been great either. My parents keep arguing, and I feel like I’m caught in the middle.\n\nI’ve been trying to stay strong, but I feel like I’m spinning. I’m losing sleep, skipping meals, and I just don’t have the motivation to do anything anymore. Some days I wonder if I’m just not cut out for all this—like maybe I’m falling behind while everyone else somehow has it together.\n\nSorry to unload all this on you. I don’t even expect you to have answers. I just needed to let it out.\n\nTalk soon,  \n—R\n\n---\n\n**✉️ Your Reply with Advice:**\n\nHey R,\n\nFirst of all, I want to say thank you—for trusting me enough to open up. It takes a lot of courage to admit when you’re struggling, and I admire that honesty more than you know. You're not alone, and just by reaching out, you've taken a powerful first step toward healing.\n\nLet’s unpack this, slowly and gently, because everything you’re going through deserves space.\n\n### 🌧️ About Work Stress\n\nFrom what you described, it sounds like your workplace is running on chaos—and you're bearing the brunt of it. Managers shifting priorities, unclear expectations, never-ending deadlines... that’s a recipe for burnout. But I want you to understand this: *you are not the problem.* A dysfunctional system doesn’t reflect your ability or worth.\n\nIf you can, try having a conversation with your manager—ask for clearer deliverables, suggest prioritizing tasks, or even request a pause to regroup. Set boundaries where you can, even if it’s just protecting one hour a day to step away and breathe.\n\nYou are not failing. You're *surviving* an unreasonable workload. That’s resilience, not weakness.\n\n### 🏠 Family Turmoil\n\nWhen the place that should feel safe starts echoing with conflict, it throws everything off-balance. I know how emotionally exhausting it is to be pulled into others’ disagreements, especially when it’s people you love. But remember: you are not responsible for fixing what isn’t yours to carry.\n\nIt’s okay to set emotional boundaries at home too. You can love your parents and still tell them, gently but firmly, that you need space from the conflict. Sometimes, detachment isn’t distance—it’s self-preservation.\n\n### 🌙 The Fog of Exhaustion\n\nThe fatigue you described? That spiral into sleepless nights and skipped meals? That’s your body waving a red flag. Stress doesn’t just live in the mind—it camps out in the body, too. I’m not here to lecture you on self-care like it’s a magic cure, but I *will* say this: even tiny acts of compassion toward yourself matter. A glass of water. A quiet 10-minute walk. A sticky note on the wall that just says: “Keep going.”\n\nYou deserve rest, not because you’ve earned it by working hard, but because rest is your *right*.\n\n### 🌀 Feeling Behind\n\nYou mentioned feeling like everyone else has it together. That feeling? Oh, it’s a liar. Behind every curated life on social media is someone else clinging to the edges just like you. Nobody’s sprinting effortlessly through this life. We’re all tripping, crawling, getting up, and trying again.\n\nComparison is such a thief of peace. Your pace is still a pace. Your struggle doesn’t make you weak—it makes you *real*.\n\n### 💡 What Might Help\n\nHere are a few gentle, realistic things you could try—not because you *have to,* but because I believe they might ease the weight just a little:\n\n- **Journaling:** Not the fancy kind. Just five minutes at night to dump your thoughts onto paper. It’s surprisingly freeing.\n- **A Reset Ritual:** Pick a small, simple ritual to signal a mental break—tea in the afternoon, a favorite playlist, standing in the sun.\n- **Talk to Someone Professional:** Therapy isn't for when you’re broken—it’s for when you need someone who can hold a mirror up and help you see what’s already inside you.\n- **Celebrate Small Wins:** Got out of bed before 9? That’s a win. Washed your hair? Win. Answered an email? Win. Let’s normalize tiny victories.\n\n### 💬 Final Thoughts\n\nR, please don’t be so hard on yourself. You are facing a storm, yes—but you’re still upright in the wind. That matters. That *counts.* The fact that you’re exhausted means you’ve been fighting. The fact that you reached out means you still believe things can get better.\n\nAnd I believe that too.\n\nYou're not broken. You're *becoming.*\n\nI’m here. For every rant, every doubt, every sleepless night. We’ll get through this—together.\n\n\n\n", "label": 5}

When work becomes a major stressor, especially under unsupportive management, it’s important to focus on what you can control.

If recognition is lacking, consider documenting your contributions and sharing them during reviews or team updates—it’s a subtle way to advocate for yourself.\n\nAs for your relationship with Tia, it’s natural to feel down when things don’t go as hoped.

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Celebrate achievements, both big and small. Public recognition can boost morale and encourage continued effort. Set clear goals so everyone knows what’s expected, and provide regular feedback—constructive criticism helps people grow if delivered respectfully.\nAvoid micromanaging. It can make employees feel distrusted and stifled. Also, don’t ignore team dynamics; unresolved conflicts or favoritism can quickly demotivate the group.\nFinally, lead by example. Show the dedication, respect, and enthusiasm you hope to see in others. Good leaders inspire not by telling, but by doing. Let me know if you'd like help tailoring these strategies to your team’s specific needsDisrespect subordinates because they are below you.\nTake credit or claim responsibility for work done by your subordinates.\nLose your temper.\nLet employees unfairly take the blame for things.\nDon't compliment or praise people for good work.\nIncentivize your employees. Make them feel that the company's success means success for them as well. There's nothing like a possible reward to motivate people.\nTake an active interest in your employees' career paths. Offer them additional training and act as their mentor.\nEmphasize a healthy work-life balance. Recognize that employees have lives outside the company.\nListen to your employees.

While remaining downtown keeps our visibility high and ensures loyal customers continue coming in, we must ask: will our foot traffic and sales grow fast enough to justify the costs?\nYour proposed model certainly offers cost savings and flexibility. A robust online presence coupled with on-site fittings could be an innovative way to adapt to modern shopping habits. The biggest challenge would be maintaining our brand's high-touch service without a showroom.\nPerhaps we should explore hybrid solutions—such as a smaller downtown fitting space while relocating production.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning can be an exciting yet challenging journey. One of the primary issues students face is a lack of consistency. Language acquisition requires regular practice, but many learners struggle to maintain a steady routine, which leads to slower progress. How can students overcome this hurdle? Setting small, achievable goals and incorporating the language into daily life—such as listening to podcasts or watching shows in the target language—can help keep them motivated.\n\nAnother common challenge is the fear of making mistakes. Many learners hesitate to speak because they’re afraid of errors, which can hinder their progress. So, how can this be addressed? Creating a supportive environment where mistakes are viewed as opportunities to learn can make a huge difference. Practicing with native speakers or in language exchange groups can also boost confidence and reduce anxiety.\n\nAdditionally, mastering pronunciation and mastering grammar rules are ongoing struggles. How can students tackle these? Consistent exposure to the language, listening carefully to native speakers, and practicing pronunciation regularly are key strategies. Understanding grammar in context, rather than rote memorization, can also make it easier to internalize complex structures.\n\nUltimately, language learning requires patience, persistence, and a positive mindset. With the right tools and a commitment to progress, students can overcome these obstacles and enjoy the rewarding experience of becoming multilingual.", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Subject: A Third Option for Our Business\n\nHi Josh and Ken,\n\nI’ve been thinking about our options, and I’d like to propose a third one that could benefit us in the long run. Instead of staying and absorbing the rent increase or moving, we could explore opening a second location in a rapidly growing area, Riverside Park.\n\nRiverside Park is just a 20-minute drive from Centerville, but it offers more affordable rent—only $2,800 per month. The area is gaining traction with young professionals and families, and we could establish a presence in an up-and-coming community. The lower rent would free up funds to improve our current store and also invest in expanding our brand.\n\nAdditionally, Riverside Park has a trendy, walkable downtown area that attracts shoppers and tourists. There’s a market for both our clothing line and the high-end coffee shop we’ve discussed. It’s an area full of potential, and establishing our business there early could give us a head start.\n\nI think it’s worth considering alongside our other options.

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Here are a few strategies to keep your team motivated and engaged. First, incentivize your employees. When they feel that the company's success directly correlates with their own, they are more likely to give their best effort. Consider offering bonuses, recognition programs, or career advancement opportunities as rewards.\n\nTaking an active interest in your employees’ career development is also important. Offering additional training, providing mentorship, and helping them achieve their professional goals shows that you are invested in their success, which builds loyalty and engagement.\n\nCreating a healthy work-life balance is key. Acknowledge that your employees have lives outside of work, and encourage flexibility when possible. This can reduce burnout and increase overall satisfaction.\n\nListening to your team is another essential practice. When employees feel heard, especially when they’re voicing concerns, they are more likely to remain productive and committed. Finally, always treat your subordinates with respect. Show empathy, be fair, and avoid the common pitfalls of taking credit for their work or losing your temper.\n\nOn the flip side, avoid actions that can demotivate. Disrespect, taking credit for others' work, and unfairly shifting blame can create a toxic environment. Lack of praise or recognition for good work can also lead to disengagement.\n\nGood luck with your team!\n\nEF student\n\n\n\n\n", "label": 5}

Or do you think a company's only responsibility is to its shareholders? We invite you to join this discussion by posting your opinion on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nFor CSR\n\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925", "label": 0}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning: Challenges and Issues\nLearning a new language can be an exciting yet challenging experience. Many students face various obstacles along the way, which can make the process slower or frustrating. One of the most common issues is lack of confidence. Learners are often afraid of making mistakes, especially when speaking. This fear can hold them back from practicing, which is essential for improvement.\nAnother challenge is vocabulary retention. Students may learn new words but forget them quickly if they don’t use them regularly. This makes reading and listening comprehension difficult. Additionally, grammar rules can be confusing, especially when they differ greatly from the learner's native language.\nTime management is also a major issue. Many learners are balancing school, work, or family, so finding time to practice consistently becomes tough. Without regular exposure, it’s easy to lose progress.\nTo overcome these challenges, students should focus on daily practice, even if it’s just for 10–15 minutes. Speaking with native speakers or using language apps can help build fluency and confidence. Setting realistic goals and celebrating small wins can also keep motivation high.\nOverall, learning a language takes patience and persistence. By recognizing the challenges early and finding ways to overcome them, students can become more successful and confident language learners.\nLet me know if you'd like it adjusted to sound more formal or personalized.", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: My Opinion on Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is no longer just a trend—it’s a necessity. In my opinion, businesses have a duty not only to their shareholders but also to society and the environment. Companies that invest in CSR show that they care about more than just profit, and this can build strong, lasting relationships with customers and communities.\n\nFirstly, CSR helps create a positive public image. When companies support causes like environmental protection, education, or fair labor practices, people are more likely to support their brand. For example, when a company reduces its carbon footprint or donates to social programs, it gains respect and trust.\n\nSecondly, CSR encourages long-term thinking. Instead of focusing only on short-term profits, responsible businesses consider how their actions affect future generations. This mindset can lead to more sustainable business practices and even innovation.\n\nHowever, it’s important that CSR efforts are genuine. Some companies only use CSR as a marketing tool without making real changes. This can lead to public backlash if people feel they are being misled.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe CSR is essential in today’s world. When done sincerely, it benefits not only the company but also society as a whole. More businesses should view social responsibility as a core part of their mission—not just a side project.\n\n", "label": 0}

In return, they hold a moral obligation to contribute positively to the communities that support them.\n\nCSR is more than a marketing tool; it is a strategic approach that aligns a company’s operations with societal goals. Companies with robust CSR practices often enjoy enhanced reputations, which translates into customer loyalty and potentially greater financial performance. The argument that CSR is merely a superficial gesture ignores the genuine benefits to both the company and society. Sustainable practices and fair labor policies, for instance, not only secure long-term operational viability but also foster employee satisfaction and productivity, reducing turnover.\n\nWhile it is true that businesses must generate profit to survive and satisfy shareholders, focusing exclusively on profit can be short-sighted. A company’s long-term success is intertwined with its ability to adapt to societal changes and expectations. By addressing social, environmental, and economic issues through CSR, companies can mitigate risks and harness opportunities that drive innovation, sustainability, and growth.\n\nUltimately, CSR is about recognizing the interconnected nature of business and society. Companies that embrace this holistic view are not only investing in their future but also contributing to a more equitable and sustainable world.", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I think companies do have social responsibility. People are the real shareholders in my opinion because we sell our workforce and our time to develop companies. The profit is only for the company and at the same time and space people are starving, eating bad food, suffering from diseases etc.\nThat’s why companies should not focus solely on financial gain. They must also contribute to the well-being of the society they operate in.\n\nThis includes providing fair wages, creating healthy working conditions, supporting community projects, and minimizing environmental harm. A business that extracts value from people and nature without giving anything back is not truly successful — it’s just exploitative.\n\nTrue corporate success should be measured not only by how much money it makes, but by how it treats people, protects the planet, and improves lives. After all, companies exist because people exist. They should serve the public good, not just private interests.\nOne concrete solution would be to create mandatory social impact reinvestment policies. This would mean that a small percentage of every company’s annual profit — for example, 3% to 5% — would be legally directed toward social and environmental projects in the communities where the company operates. This could include free local clinics, food programs, ecological restoration, or educational initiatives.\n\nGovernments could offer tax benefits to companies that go beyond this minimum and prove long-term commitment to public well-being. In addition, workers and communities could be given more voice and representation in decision-making — not just shareholders.\n", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The Naga\n\nIn Indian mythology, Nagas are serpent-like beings that hold significant cultural and religious importance. They are often depicted as half-human, half-snake creatures, possessing immense power and wisdom. Nagas are believed to reside in the underworld, known as Patala, and are guardians of treasures and sacred places.\n\nNagas can be both benevolent and malevolent. They are revered in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, often associated with water bodies like rivers, lakes, and seas. In Hindu mythology, the Naga king Vasuki is known for his role in the churning of the ocean, where he served as the rope wrapped around Mount Mandara. Another famous Naga is Shesha, the multi-headed serpent who serves as the bed for Lord Vishnu.\n\nNagas are also linked to fertility and prosperity, and many temples in India have shrines dedicated to them. They are celebrated during festivals like Nag Panchami, where devotees offer milk and prayers to appease these powerful beings. The lore of Nagas is rich and varied, making them one of the most intriguing legendary creatures in Indian mythology.", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Challenges in Language Learning\nLearning a new language is a rewarding but complex journey. Many students face common issues that can slow down their progress or affect motivation. One major challenge is pronunciation. Learners often struggle to produce unfamiliar sounds, especially when their native language lacks those phonemes. This can lead to misunderstanding and frustration.\nAnother common difficulty is grammar rules, which can be very different from a learner's first language. For example, English learners may find verb tenses or word order confusing. This often causes errors in speaking or writing.\nVocabulary retention is also a big challenge. Students may learn new words in class, but without regular practice, it's easy to forget them. Using flashcards, apps, and repetition can help, but it requires discipline.\nIn addition, lack of confidence is a psychological barrier. Many learners are afraid of making mistakes, especially when speaking. This fear can prevent them from practicing and improving.\nFinally, cultural differences may affect language use. Idioms, humor, or expressions don't always translate well, which can lead to confusion or miscommunication.\nTo overcome these challenges, students should set realistic goals, practice consistently, and stay patient with themselves. Surrounding themselves with the language — through music, movies, and conversation — can make learning more natural and enjoyable.", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: As actors in society, companies must adress with economic, environmental and social imperatives. Running a company is a long-term plan.\nSome may argue that taking care of the society is the responsability of the state.  However society is a collective entity and we all contribute in our own way to the welfare of our community. \nCompanies through their decisions have a significant influence on the shifting social norms. They must find a balance between profitability and benefiting society. We are all interconnected ; the actions or inactions of companies redefine how our society evolves. In many countries,  customers are concerned about the social and environmental image of a company. This behavior when more pronounced can have negative consequences on business growth. This means that even if some companies do not feel concerned about societal issues, they must show that they are involved regardless of their size. Consumer opinion can shift very quickly, most of the time they choose to support companies that reflect their values. Employee opinion is another reason companies must get involved in the society ; people want to feel that their work is meaningful. Investors opinion can also have an impact. \nIt seems difficult for a company to ignore the community, it’s extension and profibility are more likely to prosper if it is involved in the community.", "label": 4}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: A legendary creature of my city is the she-wolf. In addition to being the symbol of my city's team, it is a legendary creature because it is said that the Capitoline Wolf is a famous symbol of Rome, depicting a she-wolf suckling the twins Romulus and Remus, according to the legend of the city's founding. This bronze statue, probably of Etruscan origin, is preserved in the Capitoline Museums. The she-wolf is a key icon of the history and myth of Rome, and is often represented in various forms, from statues to coins, highlighting its importance in Roman culture. According to the myth, the vestal Rhea Silvia was impregnated by the god Mars and gave birth to twins, Romulus and Remus. The twins' grandfather, Numitor, was driven from the throne of Alba Longa by his brother Amulius. To prevent his grandchildren, once adults, from claiming the usurped throne, Amulius ordered one of his servants to kill them and throw them into the Tiber, but the servant did not have the courage and so he put them in a basket and let them be carried by the waters of the river. This basket ran aground on the river at the foot of a hill, where the twins were found by a she-wolf who took care of them until they were found by the shepherd Faustulus[7]. The she-wolf's lair was the legendary Lupercal near the Palatine Hill.", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature that has fascinated people for centuries is the **Tlāloc’s Acolyte**, inspired by the Aztec god of rain, Tlāloc. While Tlāloc himself is revered and feared, the Acolyte is said to roam mist-covered lakes and hidden cenotes, ensuring the balance between drought and abundance.\n\nDescribed as a humanoid figure covered in moss and amphibian-like scales, its eyes glow like lightning before a storm. According to legend, if villages disrespect the waters—polluting the sacred lakes or failing to perform rituals—the Acolyte emerges, calling forth torrential rains or relentless droughts. However, those who honor nature may glimpse it at sunrise, standing on the water’s surface as if offering a silent blessing.\n\nSome elders whisper that hearing its low, echoing voice in the wind means a season of prosperity, while others believe seeing it directly is an omen of great upheaval. Whether guardian or harbinger, the Tlāloc’s Acolyte remains a chilling yet captivating figure in Mexico’s mythological lore, tied deeply to the land's ancient traditions and unpredictable skies.", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning can be a rewarding but challenging journey, often marked by a variety of obstacles that learners must navigate. One of the primary issues is motivation. Maintaining the drive to study a language consistently can be difficult, especially when progress feels slow. Learners might become discouraged when they fail to grasp certain concepts or struggle to communicate fluidly. Another common challenge is the fear of making mistakes. Many language learners hesitate to speak out of fear that they will be judged for incorrect grammar or pronunciation, which can hinder their progress and lead to a lack of practice.\n\nLack of immersion is another obstacle. Without the opportunity to be surrounded by native speakers or to engage in real-life situations, learners may not develop the practical, conversational skills needed to function effectively in the language. Additionally, mastering grammar and syntax is often a long, tedious process. Many students find the rules of verb conjugation, word order, and sentence structure to be particularly difficult to internalize, especially when these structures are very different from their native language.\n\nFinally, learners sometimes face time constraints. Balancing language study with other commitments can make it hard to dedicate sufficient time for consistent learning and practice.

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The Importance of Learning and Personal Growth\n\nLearning is a lifelong journey that never truly ends. From the moment we are born, we start absorbing information from the world around us. As children, our brains are like sponges, soaking up knowledge quickly and effortlessly. However, as we grow older, learning often becomes more deliberate and purposeful. It requires effort, curiosity, and a willingness to step out of our comfort zones.\n\nPersonal growth is closely connected to learning. When we learn new things, we expand our understanding of the world and ourselves. This growth helps us become better individuals, more capable of handling life’s challenges and opportunities. It also opens doors to new experiences, relationships, and career possibilities.\n\nOne of the most important reasons to continue learning is to adapt to change. The world is constantly evolving, with new technologies, social trends, and ideas emerging all the time. Those who keep learning can stay relevant and competitive in their careers and personal lives. They can also contribute more effectively to their communities and society.\n\nEducation is not limited to formal schooling. While schools and universities provide valuable knowledge and skills, learning happens everywhere. Reading books, attending workshops, traveling, and even everyday conversations are all opportunities to learn. Online courses and resources have made education more accessible than ever before, allowing people to study topics that interest them from anywhere in the world.\n\nCuriosity is a key driver of learning. When we are curious, we ask questions, seek answers, and explore new possibilities. Curiosity keeps our minds active and engaged. It encourages creativity and innovation, which are essential in solving problems and improving our lives.\n\nLearning also helps build confidence. As we acquire new skills and knowledge, we feel more capable and empowered. This confidence can motivate us to take on new challenges and pursue our goals with determination. It can also improve our communication and relationships, as we become better listeners and more understanding of different perspectives.\n\nPersonal growth involves self-reflection and self-awareness. By examining our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, we can identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to grow. This process requires honesty and openness, but it leads to greater emotional intelligence and resilience.\n\nSetting goals is an effective way to guide our learning and growth. Goals give us direction and focus. They help us measure progress and stay motivated. Whether it’s learning a new language, developing a hobby, or advancing in a career, having clear goals makes the journey more rewarding.\n\nChallenges and failures are natural parts of learning and growth. Instead of fearing them, we should view them as opportunities to learn and improve. Mistakes teach us valuable lessons and build perseverance. A growth mindset—the belief that abilities can be developed through effort—is essential for overcoming obstacles and achieving success.\n\nMentors and role models can play a significant role in personal growth. They provide guidance, support, and inspiration. Learning from someone else’s experiences can help us avoid pitfalls and discover new paths. It also reminds us that growth is a shared human experience.\n\nBalancing learning with rest and relaxation is important. Burnout can occur when we push ourselves too hard without breaks. Taking time to recharge helps maintain motivation and creativity. It also improves overall well-being.\n\nIn today’s globalized world, cultural awareness is an important aspect of learning. Understanding and appreciating different cultures fosters empathy and cooperation. It broadens our worldview and helps us work effectively with diverse groups of people.\n\nTechnology has transformed the way we learn.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsability, also known as CSR, can be a very divergent topic when it comes to agreements or disagreements. In fact, it is difficult to take sides on it, but we may  conciliate and make a great difference on our lives and our community lives.\nA corporation is, beyond other meanings, a place where many people work together. Although there is a lot of definitions about it like the one pointed out by Milton Friedman, who said that the only aim of a corporation is to increase its profits, which is true, we must understand that it is still a place with people. And people live, people have families, people are a part of a community, and depend on enviroment. \nThat is why it is important for a corporation to have a commitment with the community where it is located or with the world. However, these actions cannot be in vain words nor show off something that is not true. Fake actions based only in appearance work against a corporation, because people feel that it is not a genuine thing.\nFurthermore, a corporation can gain on being social responsible. First, because their members will be affected as a part of the community. Second, this corporation will get more credit with the society. \nTherefore, corporations can have a win-win situation when they are genuine in being responsible. They can help the enviroment, work with serious organizations that really make a good effort to help society. \n", "label": 4}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most famous legendary creatures in Brazil is the Curupira. Deeply rooted in Brazilian folklore, the Curupira is a forest guardian known for its bright red hair and unique feature: its feet are turned backward. This unusual trait confuses hunters and intruders, as the footprints lead in the opposite direction, making it hard to track him.\n\nAccording to legend, the Curupira protects the forest and its animals from those who try to harm them. He is often portrayed as a mischievous and unpredictable being who punishes those who hunt for pleasure or destroy nature unnecessarily. Sometimes, he uses illusions or sounds to drive people away from the forest.\n\nThis creature reflects the strong connection between Brazilian folklore and nature conservation. Stories of the Curupira are especially popular in the Amazon region, passed down through generations as a way to teach respect for the environment. Even today, the legend of the Curupira continues to fascinate children and adults alike.", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Language learning can be exciting but also full of challenges. Many students struggle with motivation. Why is it hard to stay motivated? Often, progress seems slow, and learners feel frustrated. Another common issue is difficulty in understanding native speakers. How can students improve listening skills? Practicing with real conversations or using audio materials helps.\n\nGrammar and vocabulary are also big hurdles. What makes grammar hard? Each language has unique rules, and remembering them takes time. Vocabulary requires constant practice and repetition. Speaking fluently is another challenge. Why do learners hesitate to speak? Fear of making mistakes and lack of confidence often stop students.\n\nCultural differences can also affect learning. How does culture influence language? Understanding culture helps learners use language more naturally and appropriately. Finally, time management is important. How can learners balance practice with daily life? Setting small, regular goals can make learning manageable.\n\nIn conclusion, language students face many difficulties, such as motivation, listening, grammar, speaking, culture, and time management. Overcoming these challenges requires patience, practice, and the right strategies.", "label": 4}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I honestly think corporate social responsibility is kind of a tricky topic. On one hand, yeah, it’s cool when big companies support causes, donate money, or try to be eco-friendly. But let’s be real: most of the time, they’re doing it because it looks good, not because they actually care.\n\nLike, a huge company makes billions every year and then donates a small amount to some charity – and suddenly they’re the “heroes”? That doesn’t sit right with me. It’s more like free publicity than real responsibility. I’m not saying all of them are fake, but a lot definitely use it as a marketing move.\n\nAlso, I totally agree with what someone said: it’s the government’s job to make sure people and companies follow rules that protect society and the environment. Corporations should follow these rules, not try to act like they’re saving the world. Most of them are just looking for profit in the end.\n\nSo yeah, corporate social responsibility can be a good thing, but we shouldn’t act like companies are doing us a favor. If they really want to help, they should start by treating their workers better and not polluting the planet – not just planting trees once a year and calling it a day.", "label": 4}

Unlike high-impact workouts or complex routines, walking requires no special equipment and can be done by people of nearly all ages and fitness levels. Engaging in a daily walk of just 30 minutes can bring a wide range of health benefits. It helps improve cardiovascular health by increasing heart rate and circulation, which in turn reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke. Additionally, walking can aid in weight management by burning calories and improving metabolism.\n\nBeyond physical benefits, walking also has a positive impact on mental health. It has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression. The act of walking—especially outdoors in nature—can clear the mind, boost mood, and enhance creativity.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language can be exciting, but it also comes with several challenges. One major difficulty students face is fear of making mistakes. Many learners hesitate to speak because they are worried about grammar errors or pronunciation. This fear can slow progress and reduce confidence.\nAnother common problem is retaining vocabulary. Students may memorize new words for a test but forget them soon after. Without regular practice and real-world use, it’s easy for words and grammar rules to fade from memory.\nCultural differences can also create obstacles. Language is deeply tied to culture, and learners might struggle to understand idioms, humor, or body language that native speakers take for granted.\nFinally, consistency is a challenge. It takes time and effort to improve, and it’s easy to lose motivation when progress feels slow. How can students stay consistent? How can they create opportunities to practice? These are important questions to consider.\nTo overcome these challenges, learners should practice regularly, use the language in meaningful ways, and not be afraid to make mistakes. After all, every mistake is a step toward fluency.\nLanguage learning isn’t just about studying—it’s about connecting with others and discovering new ways of thinking. And that, in itself, is worth the effort. \n", "label": 5}

You can create any facts about your city that will support your proposal. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi Josh,\n\nAfter carefully considering our situation and the points discussed, I believe that moving to a more economical location is the best option for our business. The significant rent increase to $4,500 per month will undoubtedly cut deeply into our profits, amounting to $54,000 a year. With the slower growth in our clothing sales compared to the rising expenses and the likelihood of further rent hikes in Centerville, staying in our current location seems unsustainable.\n\nRelocating to the south end of town, as mentioned, offers substantial cost savings that can be redirected into improving other areas of our business, such as developing a superior webpage. This move would enable us to maintain our high-quality service by meeting customers at their offices or schools for measurements, thus preserving the personalized touch we are known for. While we would lose the showroom, the advantages of reducing overhead costs and potentially reaching a broader customer base online outweigh this disadvantage.\n\nI understand that the showroom has been a valuable asset, but adapting to a new model could position us better for long-term success. We can still maintain close relationships with our customers through personalized visits and an enhanced online presence.\n\nLet's discuss this further and explore how we can implement this transition smoothly to ensure our continued growth and success.\n\nThanks,\nEsther", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: My Opinion on Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nI strongly believe that companies have a responsibility not only to their shareholders but also to society as a whole. In today’s interconnected world, businesses are no longer isolated entities focused solely on profit. They operate within communities, use natural resources, and impact people’s lives in countless ways. Therefore, it is only fair that they give back and act responsibly.\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is not just an ethical obligation—it is also a smart long-term strategy. Companies that treat their employees well, protect the environment, and support local communities often enjoy greater customer loyalty and employee satisfaction. As mentioned by Jack@MSU, many consumers actively support companies with strong CSR records, which can translate into better business performance.\n\nMoreover, in the age of social media, corporate behavior is under constant public scrutiny. One irresponsible act can damage a brand's reputation quickly. On the other hand, responsible actions can build trust and goodwill. It’s no longer enough for a business to say “we follow the law.” People expect more—and rightly so.\n\nWhile I agree that governments should regulate business practices, this doesn’t mean companies should stop at the bare minimum. CSR is about going beyond what’s required and doing what’s right. In the end, companies that support society also create a better environment for their own success.\n", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most fascinating legendary creatures in Indian mythology is the Naga, a serpent-like being that appears in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions. Nagas are depicted as either fully serpentine or as divine beings with human torsos and snake-like lower bodies. They are known to inhabit underground realms or sacred water bodies such as lakes and rivers, guarding hidden treasures and ancient wisdom.\nNagas are neither entirely benevolent nor wholly malevolent; some, like Shesha, serve as protectors and supporters of cosmic balance, while others, like Kaliya, are fierce and destructive. In Hindu mythology, Lord Vishnu is often depicted resting on the coils of the great Naga, Ananta-Shesha, signifying its cosmic importance.\nThese beings symbolize transformation, duality, and hidden power. Many temples, especially in South India, have Naga shrines where devotees pray for protection, fertility, and prosperity. The Naga legend continues to thrive, influencing folklore and spiritual practices across India. ", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Hi Leon,\n\nFirst of all, you're not bothering anyone — it's totally okay to reach out when things feel overwhelming. I'm really glad you decided to share this, and it's important you know you're not alone in feeling this way.\n\nAbout Work:\nIt sounds like you're in a tough spot. A lack of recognition and poor leadership can absolutely drain your motivation. If you're not already doing so, consider documenting your accomplishments for your own clarity and for potential opportunities elsewhere — it's a confidence booster and a practical move. Also, if there's a chance to give feedback to management (even anonymously), it might be worth considering.\n\nIn the meantime, try to create small boundaries to protect your mental space — like a ritual after work that helps you reset, or even taking a break during the day to breathe and regroup. These little things can create a sense of control in a chaotic environment.\n\nAbout Tia:\nRelationships ending — or even just being in a rough patch — can hit hard, especially when you had hope in it. Be kind to yourself here. Feel what you need to feel, and don’t rush trying to \"fix\" everything at once. If this relationship does end, it doesn’t mean you were wrong to care. It means you were open to connection, and that matters.\n\nSome Perspective:\nYou mentioned I seem calm and in control — thank you for saying that. But truthfully, everyone struggles. The difference often lies in having strategies and support. You’re already showing strength just by reaching out.\n\nHere are a few small suggestions:\n\nWrite things down — journaling helps clear your head.\n\nTalk regularly with someone you trust (like you're doing now).\n\nFind something that brings joy or flow, even in small doses (music, walks, a hobby).\n\nAnd if it ever feels too heavy — talking to a therapist can be a game-changer, and it's not a sign of weakness. It's a tool for growth.\n\nYou will get through this. Things may not change overnight, but step by step, they do shift.\n\nLet me know how else I can help — I'm here.\n\nWarmly,\n", "label": 5}

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response:  motivated team is the foundation of any successful organization. When team members feel valued, supported, and driven, they perform at their best and contribute to a positive work environment. However, motivating a team requires more than just occasional praise or performance bonuses—it takes consistent leadership, understanding, and the right strategies.\nOne of the most powerful tools for motivation is clear communication. Teams need to understand the vision, their goals, and how their individual roles contribute to the bigger picture. Regular check-ins, open dialogue, and clear expectations foster trust and reduce confusion.\n\nAnother key strategy is recognition and appreciation. Acknowledging both big wins and small efforts makes people feel seen and valued. Whether it’s a public shout-out in a meeting, a thank-you note, or an employee-of-the-month program, genuine recognition boosts morale and engagement.\nWhile good strategies can inspire a team, poor leadership choices can have the opposite effect. One common mistake is using fear or pressure to drive results. Intimidation might create short-term compliance, but it leads to stress, burnout, and high turnover in the long run.", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature I find fascinating is the Chupacabra, a mythical beast that originated in Latin American folklore but has captured imaginations around the world. The name “Chupacabra” literally means “goat sucker” in Spanish, referring to its alleged habit of attacking livestock, especially goats, and drinking their blood.\n\nDescriptions of the Chupacabra vary, but it's often portrayed as a reptilian creature with greenish-gray, scaly skin, sharp spines down its back, and glowing red eyes. Some accounts describe it as more canine in appearance, like a hairless wild dog. It is said to be around 3 to 4 feet tall and moves either by hopping or on all fours.\n\nThe first reported sightings occurred in Puerto Rico in the 1990s, but since then, tales of the Chupacabra have spread across the Americas. Despite investigations and supposed sightings, no scientific evidence supports its existence. Still, the creature remains a popular subject in books, documentaries, and urban legends.\n\nWhat makes the Chupacabra so intriguing is how it reflects rural fears of mysterious predators and the unknown. Whether real or not, it continues to be a powerful symbol of mystery, survival, and cultural storytelling.", "label": 5}

You can include the links in your reply. Type in the input box. Write 80-100 words. [SEP] Response: Good morning,\n\nI researched 3 options for team training and I will point out the strengths and weaknesses of each option.\n\nThe best option, in my opinion, is the Company \"\nCreativity Factory\". In this company, groups are invited to participate in a series of creative challenges that can only be overcome with collaboration and unity. The consultants extend the time in open and deactivated spaces using strategy, active listening, empathy and flexibility. The only disadvantage is that the location faces a stretch of dirt road, which can be uncomfortable if someone has difficulty with longer journeys. Of the three options, it is also the most expensive, but it is still within our budget.\n\nThe company \"Mysterious Team\" does very fun mystery-solving activities. The mysteries can only be solved with a lot of collective intelligence. It seems very effective and the user reviews are great. The price is affordable, not much cheaper than option one. This consultancy, however, takes place in a semi-open space, within the city, bringing less of a spirit of tradition.\nThe company \"Crazy Machine\" proposes a very interesting and collective activity. Participants must form a team with emotional intelligence and analytical thinking to build a human machine, as if it were a cog to solve the problem presented.

[SEP] Response: Following a comparative evaluation of two training providers—TrainQuick and Skills Pro—we recommend proceeding with Skills Pro as our preferred training partner.\nAlthough TrainQuick offers a cost-effective and flexible solution, its uptake across branches has been inconsistent. Feedback also indicates discomfort among our employees when classes are conducted with participants from other branches, which affects overall engagement and satisfaction.\nIn contrast, Skills Pro, while more expensive, offers a more structured and rigorous program.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most fascinating legendary creatures in Indian mythology is the Naga, a serpent deity revered in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions. Nagas are often depicted as half-human, half-serpent beings, possessing immense power and wisdom. They are believed to reside in the subterranean realm called Patala, as well as in bodies of water like rivers, lakes, and oceans.\n\nNagas are considered protectors of treasures and guardians of the underworld. They are associated with water and fertility, often invoked in rituals to bring rain and ensure agricultural prosperity. In many stories, Nagas are portrayed as benevolent beings who can bestow blessings and knowledge upon those who honor them. However, they can also be fierce and vengeful if disrespected or wronged.\n\nOne of the most famous Nagas is Shesha, the king of all Nagas, who serves as the bed on which Lord Vishnu rests. Another well-known Naga is Manasa, the goddess of snakes, worshipped primarily in Bengal and Assam for protection against snakebites and other calamities.\n", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 15-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language can be a deeply enriching experience, one that opens up new avenues of communication, cultural exploration, and personal growth. The process of language acquisition involves not just memorizing vocabulary and mastering grammar rules, but also immersing oneself in the rhythm, sounds, and nuances of a completely new way of thinking and expressing oneself.\n\n### The Basics of Language Learning\n\nWhen we start learning a language, we typically begin with the basics: greetings, introductions, and simple phrases. These are often the building blocks upon which more complex structures are formed. Early exposure to a language focuses on comprehension (listening and reading) and production (speaking and writing). At this stage, it's crucial to engage in repetitive practice to help solidify these foundations.\n\n### The Role of Immersion\n\nOne of the most effective ways to learn a language is through immersion—surrounding oneself with the language in everyday situations. This could mean traveling to a country where the language is spoken or consuming media in the target language, such as books, films, music, and podcasts. Immersion accelerates learning because it forces us to adapt to the language's natural flow and usage in context, rather than just isolated vocabulary and rules.\n\n### Overcoming Challenges\n\nLanguage learning often comes with its challenges. There can be frustration when it feels like progress is slow or when we find it hard to understand native speakers. However, persistence is key. Mistakes are a normal part of the learning process, and they offer valuable opportunities for improvement. It’s important to embrace these challenges, as overcoming them often leads to the most profound growth in language proficiency.\n\n### The Power of Practice and Consistency\n\nLearning a language requires regular practice, as it’s easy to forget vocabulary or grammar rules if we don’t use them often enough. Setting aside time each day to practice—whether it’s through speaking with a language partner, writing, or reviewing grammar concepts—can lead to significant improvement over time. Consistency is more important than intensity; small, frequent practice sessions are typically more effective than long, irregular bursts of study.\n\n### Cognitive Benefits\n\nThere are numerous cognitive benefits to learning a second language. Studies have shown that bilingual individuals tend to have better memory, problem-solving skills, and multitasking abilities. Moreover, learning a language can delay the onset of cognitive decline in older adults. The brain benefits from the challenge of processing multiple languages, enhancing its overall flexibility and efficiency.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLanguage learning is not just about mastering a new set of rules—it’s about expanding your worldview and connecting with others on a deeper level. It involves patience, persistence, and a willingness to step outside your comfort zone. Whether for travel, career opportunities, or simply the joy of learning, acquiring a new language is a journey that rewards you with new experiences, deeper understanding, and the ability to engage with the world in a way that’s uniquely enriching.\n", "label": 5}

Nagas are serpent-like beings, often depicted with a human upper body and a snake’s lower half.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature that fascinates me is the Curupira, a mythical figure from Brazilian folklore. The Curupira is known as the protector of the forest, a small, human-like being with fiery red hair and feet that face backwards. Yes, you read that right—his feet are turned around, making it difficult for hunters or loggers to follow his trail, since his footprints lead in the opposite direction.\n\nThe Curupira is often portrayed as mischievous and temperamental. He uses illusions and sounds to confuse people who try to harm the forest or its animals. In many stories, he whistles loudly to lure hunters deep into the woods until they become hopelessly lost. But he isn’t evil—his main goal is to protect nature from human greed and destruction.\n\nThis creature is still widely mentioned in Brazilian culture today, especially in rural areas and among indigenous communities. He represents the voice of the forest, reminding people that nature has its own guardians and should not be exploited. What I love most about the Curupira is that he blends magic and moral lessons—respect the land, or the land will fight back.", "label": 5}

This report outlines the findings and provides a recommendation based on the analysis.\n\nTrainQuick: TrainQuick offers a cost-effective and flexible training solution. However, it has been observed that employees from other branches are not utilizing this service. Additionally, our employees have expressed dissatisfaction with the mixed-class format, where they are grouped with participants from different branches. This has led to a lack of engagement and reduced effectiveness of the training sessions.\n\nSkills Pro: Skills Pro, although more expensive, has received positive feedback regarding the quality of its course content. Despite the challenging nature of the courses, participants who enroll in Skills Pro often complete the training successfully. Furthermore, Skills Pro has plans to expand its course offerings, which indicates a commitment to continuous improvement and adaptability to future training needs.\n\nRecommendation: Considering the above factors, it is recommended to choose Skills Pro for our training needs. While it is more costly, the superior quality of training and the likelihood of successful course completion make it a worthwhile investment. Quality training is crucial for the development and retention of skilled employees, and Skills Pro's planned expansion aligns with our long-term goals.\n\nConclusion: Investing in Skills Pro will ensure that our employees receive high-quality training, leading to better performance and productivity.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature that fascinates many in India is the Naga, a mythical serpent being found in Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Nagas are divine, semi-divine beings that often appear as powerful serpents- sometimes with multiple heads- or as part-human, part-snake creatures. They are believed to reside in underground realms called Patala or near water bodies like rivers, lakes, and oceans.\nIn India mythology, Nagas are both feared and revered. They are guardians of treasure and sacred knowledge, yet if angered, they can bring natural disaster like floods or droughts. One of the most famous Nagas is Shesha, the thousand-headed serpent who serves as a bed and canopy for the god Vishnu, floating on the cosmic ocean.\nNagas symbolize fertility, rebirth, and immortality because of their ability to shed skin. Temples across India, especially in southern states, often have shrines dedicated to them, where people pray for prosperity and protection from snakebites.\nThe lore of the Naga blends spiritually, respect for nature, and ancient symbolism, making them one- of the most enduring and intriguing mythical being in indian culture.", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Hi Leon,\n\nI'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. For work, it might be helpful to have an open conversation with your manager about your concerns. Sometimes, expressing how you feel can lead to positive changes or at least offer a bit of relief. If things don't improve, consider exploring other opportunities that align better with your values and goals.\n\nRegarding your relationship with Tia, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about what isn't working. Relationships can be complicated, and sometimes they don't go the way we hope. If you decide to end things, give yourself time to heal and reflect.\n\nAbove all, make sure to prioritize your well-being. Engage in activities that you enjoy and that help you relax, whether it's exercise, meditation, or spending time with friends. Remember, it's okay to ask for help, whether from friends or professionals.\n\nI'm here for you anytime you need to talk.\n\nTake care.", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: The Dance of Souls: A Tango Story\n\nThe music began slowly, the sound of the bandoneón filling the room, a deep, longing melody that seemed to echo the very heartbeat of the night. In the dimly lit hall, the polished floor reflected the faint glow of chandeliers, casting long shadows on the walls. It was as though time had slowed, every moment suspended in the air, waiting for something—anything—to happen. And then, it did.\n\nShe stepped into the center of the floor, her dress a swirl of deep red, trailing behind her like a comet’s tail. Her heels clicked softly on the wood, punctuating the silence before the music enveloped her. A single glance from her partner, and they were already in sync, bodies drawn together by the invisible thread of the dance. He was tall, his posture elegant, the intensity in his eyes speaking of a thousand untold stories. They didn’t need words; the tango, a language all its own, would speak for them.\n\nAs the first notes of the tango swept through the room, their bodies began to move in unison. The dance was like a conversation—a delicate exchange of steps and pauses, of tension and release. The tension in the air was palpable, as if the music itself was pulling their hearts together and apart, urging them closer and then pushing them away. Their feet glided across the floor with precision, each movement a subtle declaration of emotion. The man’s hand rested firmly on her back, guiding her, while her hand lay lightly on his shoulder, a connection of trust and vulnerability. The connection between them was magnetic, impossible to ignore.\n\nIn tango, every movement was an expression of desire, of yearning, of something more than what could be put into words. The woman’s eyes were fixed on her partner, her movements a delicate balance of strength and grace. Her body arched and turned with the music, every step accentuating the curve of her silhouette. The man mirrored her movements, his own body a strong, commanding presence, yet soft in the way he followed her lead. It was a conversation of bodies, one that transcended spoken language, one that said everything without needing to say a word.\n\nThe tempo of the music increased, and with it, the intensity between them. Their steps became faster, more intricate. Each turn brought them closer, and yet, each separation added to the longing. Tango was not just about being close; it was about the space between, the moments when they were almost touching, but not quite. It was about the anticipation of a kiss that never came, the unspoken promise of something just beyond reach.\n\nThe room around them seemed to disappear. The audience, though still present, faded into the background. There was only the music, the rhythm, and the connection between them. In those brief moments, it felt as if they were the only two people in the world, bound together by the hypnotic power of the dance.\n\nAs the music reached its crescendo, the man dipped the woman low, his strong arms supporting her as her feet barely skimmed the floor. The world seemed to stop. The silence between the notes was louder than the music itself. Then, as quickly as the moment had come, it was gone. The music slowed, the tension melting away like dew in the morning sun. They stood, faces inches apart, their chests rising and falling in the shared rhythm of the dance. For a heartbeat, they were still, caught in a moment where the world outside the dance floor didn’t exist.\n\nThe final note lingered in the air, hanging on for just a second longer, before it was swallowed by the night. They stepped apart, but the connection remained. A look, a smile, a shared breath, and then they were done. The audience erupted into applause, but for them, the dance wasn’t over. It never truly ended. The tango was a story they had told without saying a word, a story of passion, of longing, and of a connection that went beyond the physical. It was a reminder that sometimes, the deepest emotions are the ones left unspoken.\n\nAs the music faded and the lights brightened, the dancers walked off the floor, each step echoing the rhythm of the dance that had just passed. But in their hearts, the tango would continue to play. The dance was in their souls now—forever intertwined, forever alive.\n\n", "label": 0}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most legendary creatures in Brazilian folklore is the Curupira. A mischievous spirit of the forest, Curupira is known for its fiery red hair and distinctive backward feet, which leave confusing tracks to trick hunters and travelers. The Curupira is a protector of the forest, using its cunning and tricks to ward off those who threaten the natural world, particularly by harming animals or destroying the woods.\n\nIt’s often depicted as a small, impish figure, sometimes with a human-like body and sometimes with animal features. Some versions of the story describe the Curupira as luring people into the forest to become lost, only to free them once they’ve learned a lesson about respecting nature. The creature’s backward feet are its most recognizable trait, making it nearly impossible for anyone to track it. This folklore serves as a reminder of the importance of respecting the environment and living harmoniously with nature, a message that resonates deeply with many in Brazil.\n\nThe Curupira is still a popular figure in Brazilian culture, appearing in stories, books, and even movies, often symbolizing the mysticism and vastness of the Amazon rainforest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) transcends mere philanthropic gestures; it represents a fundamental shift in how businesses operate and perceive their role in society. No longer is the sole focus on profit maximization acceptable; companies are increasingly held accountable for their broader impact. True CSR integrates ethical decision-making, environmental stewardship, and genuine community engagement into the very fabric of an organization's operations. This includes everything from sustainable sourcing and reduced carbon footprints to fair labor practices and investing in local communities.\n\nThe benefits of embracing genuine CSR are multifaceted. It enhances brand reputation, attracting a new generation of conscious consumers and top talent who seek purpose beyond a paycheck. Furthermore, robust CSR initiatives can lead to operational efficiencies, mitigate risks, and foster stronger relationships with stakeholders.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Naga are mystical serpent beings deeply embedded in Indian mythology. According to ancient legends, they possess the wisdom of ages and the power to shape destinies. Tales describe Naga as creatures with human-like faces and shimmering, scaled bodies that reflect the colors of nature. They dwell in hidden subterranean realms and sacred waters, guarding immense treasures and portals to the spiritual realm. Often, they are revered as protectors of wisdom and fertility, watching over both the natural world and human endeavors.\nThese beings embody a dual nature—granting blessings to the devoted while serving as harbingers of caution to the overambitious. Their presence in local folklore is marked by grand festivals and rituals aimed at appeasing their mighty spirits. The Naga remind us of the delicate balance between order and chaos, urging respect for the mysteries of nature and the ancient forces that govern it. Their legend continues to inspire art, literature, and devotion, symbolizing hope, danger, and the eternal cycle of creation and destruction.\n\n", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: A Necessary Commitment\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is no longer a mere choice for businesses; it is a crucial obligation in today’s interconnected and environmentally conscious world. CSR ensures that companies contribute positively to society while maintaining profitability.\n\nFirst, engaging in CSR builds trust and strengthens a company's reputation. Consumers are increasingly inclined to support businesses that prioritize ethical practices, environmental sustainability, and community welfare. For instance, firms like Patagonia and Ben & Jerry's have built loyal customer bases through initiatives promoting environmental conservation and social justice.\n\nSecond, CSR fosters employee satisfaction and productivity. Workers are more motivated and engaged when they see their employers actively supporting causes they care about. It creates a sense of purpose and pride, making employees feel they are part of something bigger than just generating profits.\n\nLastly, CSR ensures long-term sustainability for both businesses and the planet. Companies that adopt sustainable practices reduce their environmental footprint, comply with evolving regulations, and appeal to the growing market of eco-conscious consumers. This forward-thinking approach is essential for securing future business opportunities.\n\nCritics may argue that CSR diverts resources from core business activities. However, evidence shows that companies investing in CSR often achieve higher financial performance in the long run, as ethical practices drive consumer and investor trust.\n\nIn conclusion, corporate social responsibility is a win-win strategy that benefits businesses, society, and the environment. It is not just an ethical choice but a business imperative in the modern world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: In today’s interconnected world, companies are more than just profit-generating entities—they are integral parts of society. I strongly believe that businesses have a responsibility not only to their shareholders but also to the communities in which they operate. These communities provide the workforce, infrastructure, and consumer base that allow companies to thrive. Therefore, giving back is not just ethical—it’s essential.\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) can take many forms, such as environmental sustainability, fair labor practices, and community engagement. These efforts not only benefit society but also enhance a company’s reputation and long-term success. For instance, sustainable operations help preserve resources for future generations, while fair treatment of employees leads to higher productivity and lower turnover rates.\n\nMoreover, modern consumers are increasingly aware of the social and environmental impact of their purchases. Companies that demonstrate genuine commitment to CSR often enjoy stronger customer loyalty and brand trust. In this way, CSR is not just a moral obligation—it’s a smart business strategy.\n\nWhile governments play a crucial role in setting regulations, companies should not wait to be forced into action. Voluntary CSR initiatives show leadership and vision, and they contribute to building a more equitable and sustainable world.\n\nIn conclusion, companies should embrace CSR not only because it’s the right thing to do, but because it creates value for everyone—shareholders, employees, customers, and society at large.", "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: My Opinion on Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is no longer just a trend—it’s a necessity. In my opinion, businesses have a duty not only to their shareholders but also to society and the environment. Companies that invest in CSR show that they care about more than just profit, and this can build strong, lasting relationships with customers and communities.\n\nFirstly, CSR helps create a positive public image. When companies support causes like environmental protection, education, or fair labor practices, people are more likely to support their brand. For example, when a company reduces its carbon footprint or donates to social programs, it gains respect and trust.\n\nSecondly, CSR encourages long-term thinking. Instead of focusing only on short-term profits, responsible businesses consider how their actions affect future generations. This mindset can lead to more sustainable business practices and even innovation.\n\nHowever, it’s important that CSR efforts are genuine. Some companies only use CSR as a marketing tool without making real changes. This can lead to public backlash if people feel they are being misled.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe CSR is essential in today’s world. When done sincerely, it benefits not only the company but also society as a whole. More businesses should view social responsibility as a core part of their mission—not just a side project.\n\n", "label": 0}

Here's a paragraph with over 150 words, based on the previous sentence: \"The thing I like most about him is his laugh.\"\n\nThe thing I like most about him is his laugh. It’s not just any ordinary laugh—it’s loud, genuine, and completely contagious. Whenever he laughs, everyone around him starts to smile, and it instantly lightens the mood. His laugh has a way of making even the most serious moments feel a little less heavy. It reflects his personality: warm, open, and full of life. I remember the first time I heard it; we were in a crowded café, and something funny happened. His laughter echoed through the room and made everyone turn to look, not out of annoyance, but curiosity. Since then, I’ve associated his laugh with comfort and happiness. Even on bad days, hearing it brings me peace. It reminds me not to take everything so seriously. Some people leave an impression with their words, but he does it with his joy—and that’s something rare and beautiful.\n\nLet me know if you want it expanded or changed in tone!", "label": 0}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language can be exciting, but it also comes with many challenges. One common issue students face is fear of making mistakes. Many learners worry about speaking incorrectly, which can stop them from practicing out loud. This fear can slow down their progress and lower their confidence.\n\nAnother challenge is staying motivated over time. At first, learning can be fun, especially when picking up simple phrases. But as the material becomes more complex—like grammar rules and idioms—some students may feel overwhelmed. Without regular practice or support, it becomes easy to give up.\n\nVocabulary is also a difficult part of language learning. Students often struggle to remember new words, especially if they don’t use them regularly. Reading, listening, and using flashcards can help, but it requires consistency.\n\nFinally, not having enough real-life practice is a major issue. Many learners study a language in class but don’t get the chance to speak with native speakers. Without real conversations, students may understand the language but struggle to use it fluently.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, students can try setting small goals, using apps, joining language groups, and being patient with themselves. Learning a language takes time, but with effort and the right mindset, it is possible to succeed.\n", "label": 4}

It can take a while to get the hang of these rules, and mistakes are normal in the beginning.\n\nAnother issue is pronunciation and speaking fluently. Even if learners understand the vocabulary and grammar, they might feel shy or lack confidence to speak in real conversations. This setback can be discouraging, but practicing with native speakers or language partners helps a lot.\n\nTime management is also a big problem. Many learners find it hard to put enough hours into studying, especially when balancing work or school. I’d be really keen to find ways to stay motivated and consistent.\n\nFinally, it’s important to use a data-driven approach by tracking progress and adapting study methods. Research shows that combining reading, listening, speaking, and writing leads to better results.\n\nOverall, language learning requires patience, persistence, and good strategies. What has helped me the most is setting clear goals and putting myself forward to practice regularly.", "label": 4}

I like summer because the days are longer, the weather is warm, and there is no school. During summer, I can spend more time outside with my friends and family.\n\nI enjoy going to the beach, swimming in the pool, and eating ice cream. Sometimes we travel to different places or have picnics in the park. The sun makes everything feel happier.\n\nIn the summer, I also like to relax and read books or play games.

Our landlord just wrote me another letter about the rent. Next month, it will be raised 25% to $4,500 per month. That's going to eat even more into our profits. I mean, Josh, that's $54,000 a year!\n\nI'm going to summarize our discussions here. I know that you are strongly in favor of just staying where we are and paying the higher rent. The obvious disadvantages of that are that our sales of clothing are increasing more slowly than our expenses AND with the rapid growth in Centerville, we can expect further rent increases in the coming months. The big pro for staying is that we're in a fashionable district where long-term customers know us. We're right downtown, so customers can come in on their lunch breaks to be measured for a suit or other high-end clothing.\n\nYou know that I favor going to a completely different model. We move to the south end of town for making the clothes, but create a system where we meet people in their offices or schools to measure them for new clothes. We also open up a much better webpage than what we have now so that customers can view our clothing options and enter their measurements. Incredible cost savings! The con of that is that we lose the showroom, where customers can just come in and look at the possibilities, feel the cloth and talk to us about what would be appropriate for them. Far less personalized service, which has helped us build close relationships with our customers.\n\nHonestly, I'd like another option, but I'm out of ideas. Should we talk to more people?

As the internet becomes the main source of information, entertainment, and communication, being digitally literate allows people to navigate this vast environment with confidence and discernment.\n\nIn educational settings, digital literacy is increasingly integrated into curricula to ensure that students are prepared for the digital workforce. By teaching students how to research, analyze, and create content online, schools are providing them with the tools they need to succeed in both academic and professional settings.\n\nMoreover, digital literacy is crucial for online security. As cyber threats like identity theft, phishing attacks, and malware become more sophisticated, individuals need to know how to protect their personal information and recognize potential dangers online.\n\nIn conclusion, digital literacy is no longer a luxury, but a necessity.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Challenges Language Learners Often Face\n\nLearning a new language is exciting, but it comes with many challenges. One common issue is lack of confidence. Learners often worry about making mistakes when speaking. This fear can prevent them from practicing with others, which slows their progress. Why is this fear so strong? Usually, it comes from feeling judged or not being understood.\n\nAnother challenge is limited vocabulary. Without enough words, it’s hard to express ideas or understand others. How can students improve vocabulary? Regular reading, listening, and using flashcards can help build and retain words over time.\n\nGrammar difficulties also create problems. Many languages have different rules for sentence structure, verb tense, or gender. Students may ask, “How can I remember all these rules?” The answer lies in consistent practice and using the language in real-life situations.\n\nFinally, motivation can drop, especially when progress feels slow. What can learners do to stay motivated? Setting small goals, celebrating progress, and connecting with other learners can keep enthusiasm alive.\n\nIn conclusion, while language learning has its difficulties, students can overcome them with patience, practice, and the right strategies.\n\n\n\n\n", "label": 5}

If talking to HR or a supervisor isn’t an option, maybe try focusing on small wins that you can feel proud of, even if others don’t recognize them. But if it’s seriously affecting your well-being, it might be worth considering other opportunities. Your skills and dedication deserve to be valued.\n\nAs for Tia, relationships can be tough, especially when they don’t turn out how we hoped. It’s okay to feel down—give yourself permission to feel sad and take your time to process everything. If it does end, try to see it not as a failure, but as part of growing and learning what you need in a partner.\n\nYou don’t have to go through all this alone. I’ve got your back anytime.

The rent for a 1,200 sq. ft. showroom is around $2,800 per month, a major savings from our current location. It’s still accessible from downtown via a 15-minute express bus route, and local businesses have seen increased exposure thanks to weekend events and a growing arts scene.\n\nWe could maintain a physical space for personalized service and consultations, while using the savings to invest in a top-tier online platform.

[SEP] Response: Language learning is one of the most common challenge for various people from high school students to business person who are belonging to some international companies.\nFrom my point of view, the most difficult thing is the different compositions between what we use and what we learn.\nMost of us, Japanese, learn English in our middle high school, high school and university. The teachers offer a general English skills — common words, idioms, composition/structure and also pronunciation. However, many of us can't speak with someone from abroad because of lack of confidence nor vague memory about the language.\nI didn't really think of it then, but what I should have done in my student era was not remembering as much word as possible, but writing/speaking English as much as possible to build my confidence to express something in English.\n\nWhen we try to speak foreign language, we often hesitate to have a mistake, but who cares?\nIn reality, no one cares about our English skill — if there is someone who cares about it, their expectation for our English skill is always lower than we think. So, what we need to do is only using English without any hesitation.\n \nI don't know how much it effect on our actual English speaking skills, but I might suggest you to record and hear your English speaking from not only pronunciation point of view but also from confidence point of view — we're better speaker than we imagine.", "label": 3}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Issues and challenges that language students are several, I think that the most severe difficulty is to pass from a  language written with latin alphabet to a language with ideograms, as Chinese. In this case, there are two big challenges: learning ideograms and associating the correct pronouciation.\nHowever, I’d better talk about my own issues in learning English. The biggest issue for me is undestanding  the spoken language. If I think to the past, what I should have done is spending time in UK or USA when I was a teenager, to have a full immersion in spoken English, possibly meeting people from various geografical backgrounds. I tried to do it but my parents did not agree. Another missed opportunity was to go abroad after graduation for a post-doctoral fellowship, for at least a year. Unfortunately, those were hard times to find a job and I didn’t dare go abroad, because I was afraid of leaving the Italian job market, which was not friendly towards women. What I can do now is watching movies and watching interviews  in English with subtitles.\nAnother significant issue for me is to memorize new words and expressions. I do all my best, reading aloud and writing down and I try to practice spoken English with teachers.\n", "label": 3}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: My Opinion on Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nI strongly believe that companies have a responsibility to society beyond just generating profits for shareholders. Businesses do not operate in a vacuum—they rely on communities, natural resources, and human capital to thrive. Therefore, it is only fair that they give back and contribute positively to the environments in which they operate.\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is not just a moral obligation; it’s also a smart business strategy. As Jack@MSU mentioned, consumers today are more conscious of the values behind the brands they support. A company with a strong CSR record can build trust, loyalty, and long-term customer relationships. This, in turn, leads to better financial performance.\n\nMoreover, CSR initiatives such as fair employee treatment, environmental sustainability, and community engagement can improve employee morale and reduce turnover. When workers feel valued and see their company making a difference, they are more motivated and productive.\n\nWhile some argue that CSR is just a marketing tool or that it should be the government’s job to regulate social good, I believe that companies have the resources and influence to lead by example. Waiting for regulations is reactive—CSR is proactive.\n\nIn conclusion, companies should embrace their role as social actors. Profit and purpose are not mutually exclusive—they can and should go hand in hand.", "label": 5}

It sounds like you have a lot on your plate, and I want to remind you that you’re not alone—I'm here for you.\nWhen stress starts piling up, it can help to take things one step at a time. Prioritizing tasks and breaking them into smaller, manageable pieces can make challenges feel less overwhelming. Also, don’t hesitate to lean on others—whether it’s family, friends, or colleagues. Sometimes, sharing what’s on your mind can offer a fresh perspective and much-needed support.\nTaking care of yourself is just as important as handling responsibilities. Even a short daily break, like a walk, listening to music, or practicing mindfulness, can make a big difference in how you feel. If things feel too intense, consider talking to someone who can provide guidance, whether it’s a mentor or a professional.\nYou’re strong, and I have no doubt that you’ll get through this.

People often avoid saying \"no\" outright, instead opting for softer responses to maintain harmony. Silence can be seen as thoughtful rather than awkward.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a topic that generates diverse opinions. Some people believe that companies should align with social expectations and take an active role in building a fairer and more sustainable society. This view is based on the idea that all organizations have moral responsibilities that go beyond profit, and they should contribute to the collective well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, some view CSR with skepticism, seeing it merely as a marketing strategy or an attempt to manipulate public perception. Indeed, many companies use social initiatives to improve their image among consumers and investors. However, even when driven by commercial interests, these actions can still produce real positive impacts on society.\n\nMoreover, companies that invest in internal well-being by offering fair benefits to their employees are often recognized for it. Valuing human capital leads to lower turnover and higher productivity, showing that social responsibility can also be economically advantageous.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the motivations, it is undeniable that corporate social responsibility plays a fundamental role in today’s world. Companies have an obligation to operate ethically and sustainably, contributing to social and environmental development.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Companies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.The reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.As an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings.

With Centerville’s rapid growth, we could capitalize on the rising demand for flexible, high-end tailoring services while reducing overhead costs.\nAdditionally, we could introduce seasonal pop-up shops in high-traffic downtown areas, letting customers experience our fabrics and designs without the high monthly rental. With a strong online presence and digital measurement tools, we can bridge the gap between traditional tailoring and modern convenience.\nThis hybrid approach could give us the best of both worlds—cost savings and customer accessibility.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The Wolpertinger: Bavaria's Peculiar Beast\n\nDeep in the alpine forests of Bavaria lurks one of Germany's most whimsical legendary creatures: the Wolpertinger. \n\nThis bizarre beast appears as a patchwork of various animals, typically sporting the body of a rabbit or squirrel, the antlers of a deer, the wings of a pheasant, and sometimes the fangs of a vampire or the webbed feet of a duck. No two Wolpertingers are exactly alike, as if nature cobbled them together from spare parts.\n\nAccording to Bavarian folklore, these elusive creatures inhabit the remote mountainous regions around the Alps, emerging only during full moons to forage for food. Local hunters claim that Wolpertingers can only be caught by beautiful young women, as the creatures become mesmerized by feminine beauty and lose their natural wariness.\n\nThe legend likely originated as a playful hoax by Bavarian taxidermists in the 19th century, who would create bizarre mounted specimens by combining parts from different animals. Today, these curious creatures remain popular tourist attractions in Bavaria, with many inns and restaurants displaying supposed Wolpertinger specimens, keeping this charming piece of German folklore alive.", "label": 5}

You can create any facts about your city that will support your proposal. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Living by the ocean can be a truly wonderful experience. Every morning, the sound of the waves and the scent of salt in the air create a peaceful and calming atmosphere. Many people choose to live near the coast because of the natural beauty and the relaxing environment. Walking along the beach, collecting seashells, or simply sitting and watching the sunset can help reduce stress and improve mental health.\n\nThe ocean also provides many recreational activities. People often swim, surf, fish, or sail in the sea. These activities promote a healthy lifestyle and allow people to connect with nature. Coastal towns usually have a strong sense of community, where neighbors know each other and spend time together outdoors.\n\nHowever, there are also some challenges. The cost of living near the ocean can be high, especially in popular tourist areas. Salt in the air can damage cars, houses, and electronics over time. Coastal regions are also more exposed to extreme weather, like hurricanes and strong storms.\n\nDespite these downsides, many residents believe the benefits outweigh the negatives. Being close to the ocean brings a sense of freedom and happiness that is hard to find elsewhere. It reminds us of the power and beauty of nature — and offers a lifestyle many people dream of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "label": 4}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language can be an exciting journey, but it also comes with many challenges. One common issue students face is fear of making mistakes. Many learners hesitate to speak because they worry about grammar errors or pronunciation. But making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process—just like how children learn their first language.\n\nAnother difficulty is remembering vocabulary. Even when students understand grammar rules, limited vocabulary can make communication difficult. What strategies can help retain new words better? Flashcards, real-life practice, and using new words in context are useful techniques.\n\nStudents also struggle with staying motivated. Language learning takes time, and progress can feel slow. How can learners stay engaged? Setting small goals, celebrating progress, and immersing in the language through music, shows, or books can make the process more enjoyable.\n\nFinally, cultural differences may present challenges. Idioms, body language, and social norms vary widely, and understanding them is key to becoming fluent.\n\nAlthough these obstacles are common, they can be overcome with patience, persistence, and the right strategies. With consistent practice and a positive mindset, any learner can achieve their language goals.", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that‚Äôs popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature that fascinates me is the Curupira, a mythical being from Brazilian folklore. The Curupira is a small, red-haired forest guardian with a striking feature—his feet are turned backwards. This unusual trait helps him confuse hunters and travelers by leaving footprints that lead in the opposite direction. The Curupira is known for his supernatural speed and piercing whistle, which can drive people mad or lead them astray deep into the forest.\n\nHe fiercely protects the Amazon rainforest and its creatures from harm, especially those who hunt animals unnecessarily or cut down trees without need. The Curupira can be both a trickster and a punisher—sometimes luring people into the woods as a warning or punishment. Despite his fearsome powers, he is respected and even admired by those who live close to nature.\n\nThis creature reflects Brazil’s cultural connection to the environment and the idea that nature itself fights back when disrespected. The Curupira is a powerful symbol of balance between humanity and the wild, blending fear, respect, and the mystery of the forest into one unforgettable figure.\n\n ", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that‚Äôs popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most iconic legendary creatures in Indian mythology is the **Nāga**, a powerful serpent being revered across Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Nāgas are typically depicted as half-human and half-snake, often with a human torso and the lower body of a serpent. They are believed to dwell in the underworld (Pātāla) or near bodies of water like rivers, lakes, and oceans. In many stories, Nāgas are guardians of treasures, sacred knowledge, and powerful secrets. They are associated with fertility, rainfall, and the life-giving power of water. Though sometimes portrayed as dangerous or vengeful when provoked, Nāgas are generally considered wise and divine, and many are protectors of dharma. The serpent king Shesha, who serves as a bed for the god Vishnu, and Vasuki, who helped churn the ocean of milk, are two of the most famous Nāgas. Their presence in art, temple carvings, and folklore reflects their deep cultural significance in India, symbolizing both the mystery of nature and the balance between danger and protection.", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that‚Äôs popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: A legendary tale, A myth of a bull in the state Karnataka. In the heart of the Western Ghats, near the misty hills of Coorg, people whisper tales of the Kere Basava—a half-man, half-bull spirit said to rise from the lake during the full moon. Elders say he was once a humble temple bull, deeply loyal to his master, a wandering sadhu. When the sadhu was wrongly accused and killed by the village chief, the bull stood by the lake and mourned for seven days and nights. Touched by his grief, the gods transformed him into a guardian spirit.\n\nIt is said that if you are near the lake late at night and you hear the sound of heavy footsteps and jingling bells, you should quietly leave the place. The Kere Basava does not harm the innocent, but if he senses pride, cruelty, or disrespect towards nature, he will not spare the offender. Many villagers claim to have seen his glowing eyes in the dark or heard his deep breath near the water.\n\nEven today, in small towns across Karnataka, people speak of him with respect and caution. The story of the Kere Basava reminds everyone to live humbly and honour the bond between humans, animals, and the natural world.", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: The Big Online Debate\nDo you believe companies have a responsibility to society? Or do you think a company's only responsibility is to its shareholders? We invite you to join this discussion by posting your opinion on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nFor CSR\n\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925", "label": 0}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that‚Äôs popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature I find particularly fascinating is the kitsune from Japanese folklore. Kitsune are mythical foxes known for their intelligence, long life, and magical abilities. As they age, they grow more powerful and can develop multiple tails—up to nine—with nine-tailed kitsune being the most revered and feared.\n\nThese creatures are often shape-shifters, capable of transforming into beautiful women or even everyday objects. Some legends depict kitsune as loyal guardians, friends, or lovers, while others describe them as mischievous tricksters who enjoy confusing or deceiving humans. Kitsune are also closely associated with the Shinto deity Inari, the god of rice and prosperity. In this context, they act as divine messengers and are revered in many shrines across Japan.\n\nWhat makes the kitsune especially compelling is its dual nature—both benevolent and dangerous, sacred and playful. This ambiguity has helped the kitsune remain a popular and enduring figure in Japanese culture, appearing in everything from ancient legends to modern anime and video games. ", "label": 5}

That means we could still attract style-conscious customers, including young professionals and artists.\n\nAlso, the district just launched a “Shop Local” campaign that supports small businesses with advertising and free weekend events. We could participate in those to increase our visibility. Since it’s only a 10-minute drive from downtown, we wouldn’t lose our loyal clients—we could even offer free Uber rides for fittings over $500.\n\nLet’s also improve our website and consider Ken’s idea of visiting clients on-site, especially for larger orders. With this hybrid model, we keep our personal touch, reduce costs, and stay visible in the community.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts!\nBest,", "label": 5}

They are believed to live in underground realms filled with treasure and sacred knowledge, especially near water bodies like rivers, lakes, and oceans.\n\nNagas are both feared and revered. In some stories, they are protectors of nature and guardians of sacred sites. In others, they are associated with floods, storms, and vengeance when disrespected. The serpent Ananta-Shesha, a thousand-headed Naga, is said to support the god Vishnu as he rests between creations of the universe.\n\nNagas symbolize rebirth, immortality, and the connection between the earthly and spiritual realms. Their presence in temple carvings and folklore shows their importance in Indian culture, representing both danger and divine protection.", "label": 5}

Let’s consider a hybrid model based in Chennai’s Anna Nagar district—an up-and-coming area known for both its commercial growth and affordable rents (closer to $2,800/month for similar space).\nHere’s how it works: we lease a smaller showroom there, modern and stylish but more compact. We maintain a tactile, in-person experience for customers—appointments only, which gives us a sense of exclusivity. Meanwhile, we also launch the mobile measuring service and invest in a robust digital platform like Ken proposed.\nThis approach keeps us rooted in personalized service while trimming costs and embracing flexibility.

[SEP] Response: Dear Harry,\n\nHere are some tried-and-true ways to foster a positive, motivated team environment—as well as some common missteps to avoid.\n\nTo truly engage your employees, start by **incentivizing their efforts**. Whether through performance bonuses, recognition programs, or simple acknowledgment, showing that success is shared creates a culture of ownership. Take a real interest in their professional growth too. Providing training opportunities and mentoring shows you're invested in their future, not just their output.\n\nEqually important is encouraging a **healthy work-life balance**. Let your team know their well-being matters. When people feel respected as whole individuals, they tend to give their best. And never underestimate the power of listening—validation goes a long way in building loyalty and trust. Finally, lead with empathy: treat your team how you’d want to be treated by your own boss.\n\nAvoid pitfalls like taking undue credit, placing blame unfairly, or showing disrespect. These actions quickly undo all your efforts. A little appreciation and humility can go a long way.\n\nWishing you and your team all the best,  \nEF Student\n", "label": 5}

Not only can it affect an employee´s moral, but it can have wider consequences on the company as a whole. It´s hard to imagine any company doing well without motivated emplyees.

Listen to you employees!\n\n* Offer them additional training, and act as their mentor. If employees feel that a brighter future is ahead, it will motivated people.\n\n* Make them feel that company´s succes means success for them as well. There´s nothing like a possible reward to motivate people. a program like this will probably have to come from upper managemnet, not just from the direct manager.\n\nBut what can you do to demotivate your staff? \n\n- Use your managerial position to show people who´s boss.\n- Lose your temper. Getting angry always shows people who´s boos.\n- Don´t compliment or praise people takes much more work than demotivating them, but if you follow the tips above, you can build a solid, productive team!.\n", "label": 3}

Each pink star is made of a marble called terrazzo, a bronze shield with the honoree’s name and an icon of the celebrity job, like a camera, television or a microphone, for example.\n\nThe Internet: A Remarkable Invention\nThe internet is one of the most amazing inventions in modern history. It all began in the 1960s when scientists created a way for computers to talk to each other. This network of connected computers grew over time, and in the 1990s, the internet became accessible to the public. Today, it plays a crucial role in our lives, allowing us to connect with people from all over the world, find information, and enjoy a world of entertainment. Thanks to this incredible invention, the way we communicate and learn has been transformed, making the world a smaller and more connected place.\n\nThe Grand Canyons: Nature’s Masterpiece\n", "label": 0}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Gandeberunda\nYou probably already know the story of Narasimha, Vishnu’s hybrid avatar. Evil demon Hiranyakashipu gets a boon from Brahma that makes him practically invincible, which in turn gives him the licence to terrorize everyone. But when he tries to murder his own son, Vishnu decides that enough is enough and vanquishes Hiranyakashipu in the most creative way (you see, all boons come with loopholes) in his Narasimha avatar.\n\nThe story doesn’t end there though. Even with Hiranyakashipu out of the picture, Narasimha is still really, really angry, and afraid that his anger issues would destroy the world, the gods beseech Shiva to do something. Of course, the only way to tackle a powerful mythical creature is to turn into a powerful mythical creature yourself. Shiva becomes Sharabha – a half-lion (to match Narasimha, understandably) and half-bird form (the OG Angry Bird) – and manages to subdue Narasimha. The story is still not over, because Narasimha becomes Angrier Bird – taking on the form of Gandeberunda, a gigantic two-headed bird with Hulk-like strength. Sharabha, thankfully, calls it quits after 18 days of fighting and Gandeberunda also finally calms down. This powerful bird happens to be the state emblem of Karnataka, and the Gandeberunda motif can be found in many places in India, including temple architecture.", "label": 5}

Consumers want some special meaning or feeling more than 'just shopping'. \n\nFollowing these consumer trend, companies start to care - or act like they care- about CSR. In result it leads to the win-win situation: companies would spend more money to contribute a sociaty such as donating money, helping the weak, investing the community and etc. Consumers have great feeling to help others by purchasing products.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Okay, I will provide the response in English, following the instructions from the image.\nHere's an example of how you can answer the task, keeping within the 150-250 word limit and addressing the required points. You can use this as inspiration and adapt it with your own ideas and experiences.\nMy Response (Example):\nLearning a new language is an incredibly rewarding journey, but one that frequently presents a unique set of challenges. One of the most common hurdles is the lack of confidence to speak. Many students, even those with a solid grasp of grammar and vocabulary, hesitate to practice conversation due to the fear of making mistakes or not being understood. This inhibition can significantly hinder progress towards fluency.\nAnother significant challenge lies in consistency and motivation. While initial enthusiasm is often high, maintaining a regular study routine, whether daily or weekly, can prove difficult amidst other responsibilities. The feeling of hitting a plateau, where progress seems slow, can also lead to demotivation. Furthermore, pronunciation is an area where many struggle, as the sounds of a new language can differ greatly from those in one's native tongue, demanding intensive practice and repetition.\nFinally, limited immersion poses a major problem for learners who do not live in a country where the target language is spoken. The lack of constant exposure to the language in real-life contexts—such as hearing casual conversations, watching local TV, or reading street signs—makes natural absorption and the assimilation of cultural nuances much harder. Overcoming these challenges requires discipline, effective study strategies, and, above all, persistence.\nGuidance for you when typing your response:\n * Think about your own challenges: Have you ever tried to learn a language? What were your difficulties? Use your experiences to make the text more authentic.\n * Guiding Questions (you can ask yourself):\n   * What are the biggest difficulties someone faces when trying to speak a new language?\n   * How can grammar or vocabulary be tricky?\n   * Is it hard to stay motivated? Why?\n   * What are the problems with access to resources or lack of practice?\n   * How does culture affect learning?\n * Structure: Start with an introduction, elaborate on your points in one or two paragraphs, and conclude with a brief summary.\n", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I believe companies absolutely have a responsibility to society, not just to their shareholders. While profit is essential for survival and growth, a company's long-term success is closely tied to the well-being of its employees, customers, and the communities in which it operates.\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) isn't just a moral stance—it's also a strategic one. When companies invest in social initiatives, sustainable practices, or fair labor conditions, they build trust and loyalty. Consumers today are more informed and selective; many will choose a brand that aligns with their values over one that doesn’t. As Jack@MSU rightly pointed out, CSR can drive customer satisfaction and boost performance.\n\nFurthermore, as lil@213 said, the relationship between business and society is a two-way street. Communities provide labor, infrastructure, and market access; companies must give back in return—through education programs, environmental care, or employee support.\n\nOf course, governments play a vital role in setting regulations, but relying solely on legal requirements sets the bar too low. True leadership means going beyond compliance and setting examples for others to follow.\n\nNeglecting CSR risks public backlash, employee dissatisfaction, and long-term instability. Responsible businesses create shared value—for shareholders, yes, but also for society as a whole.\n\nIn the end, doing good and doing well are not opposing goals—they’re two sides of the same coin.\n", "label": 5}

Speaker A highlights the significance of knowing Elaine Fayyad, the office manager, as she is the go-to person for many things. Speaker B wants to know the proper procedures and uses question tags to confirm his understanding. For example, he says, “So I’ll need to talk to Elaine if I want to get my personal locker, won’t I?” The question tag “won’t I?” is used because the statement is affirmative, and the tag needs to be negative.\n\nSpeaker B also asks about IT support by saying, “We have IT support staff, don’t we?” This is another example of a positive statement followed by a negative tag. Speaker A responds by recommending Cleveland Butler, who is known for being helpful and skilled.

[SEP] Response: Hi Josh and Ken,\n\nAfter considering both of your suggestions, I’d like to propose a third option: a hybrid approach that blends the benefits of both models.\n\nWe could keep our current downtown location but transition to a more flexible showroom concept. Instead of maintaining a full retail space, we could downsize to a smaller location and make it more of an “appointment-only” showroom, where customers can book time to view the collection, get measured, and discuss options. This way, we maintain the personal touch and high-end experience that we’re known for, but at a reduced cost.\n\nTo complement this, we could invest in an efficient, easy-to-use online platform, offering virtual consultations and allowing customers to input their measurements directly. The savings from the reduced rent could help fund this digital expansion, offering us an additional revenue stream. Plus, with Centerville growing rapidly, it might attract a broader customer base who prefers the convenience of both online shopping and in-person visits by appointment.\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\n", "label": 4}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature that fascinates me is the Naga, a mythical serpent being deeply rooted in South Asian folklore, especially in India. In Hindu mythology, Nagas are semi-divine beings that are half-human and half-cobra. They are often associated with water bodies like rivers, lakes, and wells, and are believed to be guardians of treasure and powerful secrets.\n\nNag Panchami is a festival celebrated in many parts of India to worship these creatures, showing the cultural importance they hold. Nagas are depicted both as protectors and as dangerous beings if angered. In epics like the Mahabharata, the Naga king Vasuki plays a vital role during the churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthan). They are also believed to inhabit an underground realm known as Patal Lok.\n\nWhat makes Nagas particularly interesting is how they bridge the gap between the divine and earthly realms. They symbolize fertility, immortality, and rebirth due to their ability to shed skin. Despite their fearsome form, they are often revered and prayed to for blessings and protection. The Naga remains a powerful symbol in Indian art, temples, and stories even today.", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Language learning is an exciting journey, but it comes with its fair share of challenges. One of the biggest struggles students face is pronunciation—many languages have sounds that don’t exist in a learner’s native tongue, making them tricky to master. Additionally, grammar rules can be complex and full of exceptions, leading to confusion.\nAnother common challenge is vocabulary retention. With thousands of new words to absorb, learners often forget or mix them up, especially without regular practice. Speaking confidence is also a hurdle—many students fear making mistakes, which can hold them back from real-world conversations.\nLanguage learners may also struggle with immersion and exposure. If they don’t have access to native speakers or authentic materials, their learning can feel stagnant. Lastly, motivation plays a big role; without consistent effort and enthusiasm, learners may struggle to progress.\n\nDespite these challenges, persistence, interactive learning methods, and real-world practice can help overcome obstacles.

Its name translates to 'goat-sucker' in Spanish. This horrible monster terrorized Mexico en the 90's.

You can create any facts about your city that will support your proposal. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: It sounds like you're weighing some important factors regarding the rent increase and the future of your business. Staying in the current location offers the benefits of an established, recognizable presence in a fashionable district with convenient access for customers. However, the significant rent hike—up to $54,000 annually—will substantially cut into your profits, especially if sales growth isn't keeping pace.\n\nGiven the slow increase in clothing sales compared to mounting expenses, it might be worth exploring alternative options. For example, you could consider negotiating with the landlord for a longer-term lease at a more manageable rate, or looking into other locations in Centerville that might offer lower rent costs but still attract your target clientele. Additionally, analyzing whether the foot traffic and customer loyalty in your current spot outweigh the financial pressure of the increased rent is crucial.\n\nUltimately, balancing the value of the prime location against the financial strain is key.

[SEP] Response: From: Ken\nTo: All\nSubject: Urgent: Business Direction & Rent Increase\n\nJosh,\n\nWe really need to make a firm decision regarding the future of our business. I just received another letter from our landlord, and unfortunately, the rent is set to increase by 25% next month—up to $4,500 per month. That’s a significant jump and adds up to $54,000 annually, which will directly cut into our already thinning profit margins.\n\nTo summarize our ongoing discussions: you’re strongly in favor of staying where we are despite the cost increase. The advantage, of course, is our prime location in a fashionable downtown district, where loyal customers are used to visiting us, often on their lunch breaks, for fittings. However, we’re facing rising expenses while sales growth remains slow—and future rent hikes seem inevitable given Centerville’s rapid development.\n\nOn the other hand, I support transitioning to a more flexible model. We could relocate production to the south side and meet clients at their workplaces or schools. By enhancing our website, customers could browse our collections and enter measurements online. This approach would cut costs significantly, though we’d lose our showroom experience and the personalized service that has built our reputation.\n\nI’m honestly open to other ideas—we just need to make a decision soon. Should we consult with other business owners or clients? Let’s discuss options.\n\nThanks,\nKen", "label": 0}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I believe that corporate social responsibility is very important today. Companies should not only focus on making money. They should also think about the environment, their employees, and the sociate they work.\n\nWhen a company acts in a responsible way, people trust it more. Customers prefer to buy to companies that care about the planet and treat people well. For example, a company that uses less plastic or supports local projects will have a better image. Also, if a company has good values their employees will be happier and will feel more aligned with their own values.\n\nCSR is not only good for society, it also helps companies grow. When a business respects people and the planet, it becomes stronger and more successful in the long term.\n\nIn conclusion, I think all companies should include social responsibility in their plans. It is not just something “nice” to do, it’s necessary. A responsible company can make a real difference in the world while also doing good business.\n\nIn the future, I believe CSR will become even more important in the futuros and there will be more laws regulating the actions that the companies are doing in this matter.\n\nThank you for your attention\n", "label": 3}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Why CSR Is Essential\nBy Oscar\n\nShould businesses focus only on making money, or do they also have a duty to society? Today, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is more than just “doing the right thing”—it’s a key part of building a successful and sustainable business.\n\nCompanies affect the communities and environment around them. CSR means taking responsibility through sustainable practices, fair treatment of employees, and ethical decision-making. It’s not just about charity—it’s about making social and environmental concerns part of business strategy. More and more consumers choose to support companies that respect workers, protect nature, and engage with their communities.\n\nBy adopting sustainable practices, businesses go beyond meeting ethical standards. They build trust and loyalty, which leads to long-term success. Responsible companies pay fair wages, maintain safe workplaces, and reduce pollution. Sustainability is no longer optional—it’s expected.\n\nSome argue that a company’s main role is to earn profits for shareholders and that social issues should be left to governments. Others think CSR is just a marketing strategy. However, the opposite is often true. Investing in social and environmental responsibility can lead to innovation, attract top talent, and reduce long-term risks. For example, eco-friendly practices can lower energy and waste costs, while ethical labor policies improve company reputation and employee motivation. In a competitive market, companies that align with public values are more likely to preferable to customers.\n\n\nIn conclusion, CSR should be a key part of every company’s strategy. By balancing economic, social, and environmental goals—known as the Triple Bottom Line—businesses can succeed while making a positive impact on society.", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature from Indian mythology that has fascinated people for centuries is the Nāga. Nāgas are serpent-like beings, often depicted as half-human and half-cobra, and they hold a significant place in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions.\n\nIn Hindu mythology, Nāgas are considered powerful and wise, living in the mystical underground realm of Pātāla. They are guardians of treasures and sacred rivers, and some are even associated with rain and fertility. The most famous Nāga is Shesha, the cosmic serpent who serves as the bed for Lord Vishnu and is said to hold the universe on his many hoods.\n\nNāgas can be both benevolent and vengeful. If respected, they bring prosperity and protection. But if angered—especially by the destruction of their habitats—they can bring misfortune. This dual nature makes them both revered and feared.\n\nIn many parts of India, especially in the south, people still worship Nagas at serpent shrines, offering milk and flowers to seek blessings or protection.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature that is both fascinating and popular in many cultures is the dragon. Dragons are often depicted as large, serpentine creatures with the ability to fly and breathe fire. In Western folklore, they are usually portrayed as fearsome beasts, guarding treasures or terrorizing villages, only to be slain by heroic knights. These dragons often have scales, wings, and a menacing appearance.\n\nConversely, in Eastern traditions, particularly in Chinese mythology, dragons are revered as benevolent and wise beings. They are associated with water and bring rain, symbolizing prosperity, strength, and good fortune. Chinese dragons are depicted as long, snake-like creatures with antler-like horns, whiskers, and without wings, gliding through the sky with mystical grace.\n\nDespite their differing portrayals, dragons universally embody power and mystery. They continue to captivate the human imagination, appearing in countless stories, artwork, and modern media. Their enduring presence across cultures speaks to their symbolic versatility, representing both the untamed forces of nature and the potential for great wisdom and protection.", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: \n\nMy friend has a very balanced lifestyle that contributes to his health and well-being. He starts the day with a morning routine that includes stretching and a light walk, which helps activate his body and mind for the day ahead. In addition, he maintains a healthy diet, prioritizing fresh, natural, and nutrient-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, and lean proteins. He avoids processed foods and excessive sugars, preferring home-cooked meals with carefully selected ingredients. To stay properly hydrated, he drinks plenty of water throughout the day and limits sugary drinks and alcohol consumption. Another important habit is regular physical exercise; he goes to the gym three times a week, alternating between weight training and aerobic activities like running and cycling. This helps not only with physical conditioning but also cardiovascular health and stress management. Additionally, he values quality sleep, aiming to get about seven to eight hours per night, which is essential for body recovery and maintaining mental alertness. To take care of his mental health, he sets aside time to relax, meditate, or engage in hobbies he enjoys, such as reading books and listening to music. He also avoids sedentary behavior at work by standing up regularly to walk around or do small active breaks. Another important point is that he undergoes regular medical check-ups to monitor his overall health and prevent potential problems before they worsen. He also keeps an active social circle with friends and family, which contributes to his emotional balance and happiness.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 15-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language is an exciting but challenging journey. Many students face several difficulties along the way. One common problem is the fear of making mistakes. This fear often stops students from speaking in class or practicing with native speakers. How can learners overcome this fear? One solution is to create a supportive learning environment where mistakes are seen as a natural part of the learning process.\n\nAnother challenge is remembering vocabulary and grammar rules. Why do students forget new words easily? It often happens when they don't use the language regularly. To solve this, learners can practice daily by watching videos, reading articles, or chatting with friends in the target language.\n\nMotivation is also a big issue. At first, students feel excited, but over time, they may lose interest. How can learners stay motivated? Setting small, achievable goals and celebrating progress can help. For example, learning five new words a day or having a short conversation once a week can build confidence.\n\nFinally, exposure to the language outside the classroom is essential. Without real-life practice, it's hard to improve listening and speaking skills. Joining language exchange programs or using language apps can make a big difference.\n\nIn conclusion, while language learning has many challenges, with the right strategies and a positive attitude, students can succeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: Dear Josh and Ken,\nI understand the critical importance of the decision regarding our company's future location. I completely agree with Ken that we need to explore various options before making a final determination. Therefore, I believe it's essential that we investigate additional alternatives, seek advice from those who've faced similar situations, or even consider consulting with experts in this field.\nI've been researching the experiences of entrepreneurs who've gone through similar processes.

In this regard, it's recommended that we establish strategic alliances with other companies to strengthen our position and competitiveness.\nConsidering this, I'd like to propose a third option: the possibility of moving our manufacturing operations to a location with lower rental costs.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: **My Opinion on Corporate Social Responsibility**\n\nI believe companies absolutely have a responsibility to society, and this responsibility goes far beyond simply maximizing profits for shareholders. While profit is essential for any business to survive, corporations operate within and benefit from society—therefore, they should give back to it.\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is not just ethical, it’s also strategic. Companies that support communities, treat employees fairly, and operate sustainably often see higher customer loyalty, better employee retention, and long-term stability. For example, when a company invests in environmental protection or education in its local area, it strengthens its reputation and builds trust with consumers. People want to support brands that care about more than just their own bottom line.\n\nSome argue that CSR is just a marketing tool or that it distracts from a company’s primary goal. However, doing good and doing well are not mutually exclusive. Responsible behavior can lead to stronger brand value, fewer legal issues, and even cost savings in the long run. And in a world where consumers are more informed and values-driven than ever, ignoring CSR can damage a company's image and profitability.\n\nIn short, companies should not just exist to serve shareholders. They should also act as responsible citizens, working to create a fairer, cleaner, and more sustainable world for all.\n", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility or CSR its a really big topic nowadays.\nCompanies do have a social responsability beyond having profits. As an active part of the society they can´t ignore the impact they have in their community. \nCompanies directly influence the economic and social environment. Some people believe that communities allow companies to operate their territories so they get a two-way street and also they think that happy customers would care about the company, consumers reflect their loyalty with that company and both gets benefits. So in this case being socially responsible is not only ethical but also intelligent.\nThe problem with corporate social responsability is that the main objective of a company is to generate profits.\nHowever only looking for a profit benefits does not allow some companies to grow, it´s still quite cheap marketing device to buy a good public image. We can´t just wait that the government make and enforce laws to benefit a greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations but not just wait for them.\nIn conclusion companies have a responsibility that goes beyond economic benefits. Commitment to the community, employees and the environment is also a strategy to grow and have a positive impact on society.", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: I think that companies could have an impact in society and a good CSR project even could help or support an important part of the population.

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Harry,\nHere are some helpful ideas to keep your team motivated. Incentivize your employees- when they see the company's success as their own, they're more driven. Show genuine interest in their growth by offering training and mentorship. Support a healthy work- life balance, recognizing that people have lives beyond work. Listen actively, even to complaints, and create an environment where everyone feels heard. Most importantly, treat your team the way you'd want to be treated by your superiors -  with fairness and respect.\nOn the other hand, avoid these common demotivators: Never disrespect subordinates just because of rank. Don't take credit for others' efforts- it damages trust and morale. Keep your temper in check; outbursts hurt team dynamics. Never allow unfair blame to fall on an employee, as it creates fear and resentment. Lastly, always recognize good work - praise can be a powerful motivator.\nMotivation isn't just about big rewards - it's about everyday respect, support, and appreciation.\nBest of luck with your team!\n- EF Student", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language is an exciting yet challenging journey. Students often face obstacles that can slow their progress or make them doubt their abilities.\nOne of the biggest challenges is memorizing vocabulary and grammar rules. Words can seem endless, and mastering sentence structure takes time. Many learners struggle with retention, especially if they don’t use the language regularly.\nAnother common issue is pronunciation and accent. Certain sounds may not exist in a student's native language, making them difficult to pronounce. Fear of sounding incorrect can discourage learners from speaking, which limits their practice.\nConfidence and fear of mistakes also play a huge role in language learning. Some students hesitate to speak because they worry about being judged. However, making mistakes is a natural part of learning, and overcoming this fear is crucial for improvement.\nFinally, lack of immersion and practice opportunities can slow progress. Without regular exposure to the language—such as conversations with native speakers—students struggle to develop fluency.\n\n", "label": 4}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: While the primary objective of any business is to generate profit, I strongly believe that companies also have a broader responsibility to society. This view doesn’t oppose capitalism; rather, it aligns with a more sustainable and ethical version of it.\n\nCompanies do not operate in a vacuum. They use public infrastructure, benefit from educated workforces, and rely on stable communities to succeed. With this access comes a duty—not just to shareholders, but also to stakeholders: employees, customers, communities, and the environment.\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is not only morally right—it’s also smart business. A growing number of consumers actively support ethical companies, and employees are more loyal to companies that treat them and their communities well. In the long run, CSR can drive innovation, reduce risk, and build brand strength.\n\nThat said, CSR should not be used as a hollow marketing tactic. True responsibility means making real changes: fair labor practices, environmentally sustainable operations, and active community support—not just occasional donations or one-off initiatives.\n\nIn conclusion, companies must pursue profits responsibly. They have the power—and therefore the responsibility—to contribute positively to the society that enables their success. Profit and purpose are not mutually exclusive—they are partners in long-term, sustainable success. - Alcocer@1980", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: People today are more socially conscious than ever, and buyers are prepared to pay more for sustainable products. Companies can report their efforts to buyers and other stakeholders by developing a CSR model. \nCorporate social responsability is a business model that encourage companies to preserve the environment; to be socially accountable to itself, its stakehders and the public. Companies are aware how they impact aspects of society and the how they need to enhance the environment.\nThe more visible and succesful a company is, the more responsibility it has to set standards of ethical behavior for its peers, competition, and industry.\nAccording to a study published in the Wall Street Journal, consumers are more likely to act favorably toward a company that has acted to benefit its customers.\nAs a company engages in CSR, it is more likely to receive favorable brand recognition. Additionally, workers are more likely to stay with a company they believe in. This reduces employee turnover, disgruntled workers, and the total cost of a new employee.\nCSR practices help companies mitigate risk by avoiding troubling situations. This includes preventing adverse activities such as discrimination against employee groups, disregard for natural resources, unethical use of company funds, and activity that leads to lawsuits, and litigation. \n\n", "label": 4}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility: A Key to Sustainable Growth\nAs businesses operate within communities, their impact extends beyond profit-making. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become essential for companies to demonstrate their commitment to ethical practices, environmental sustainability, and social welfare. By integrating CSR into their core strategies, businesses can build trust, enhance their reputation, and foster long-term loyalty among customers and stakeholders.\nOne key argument in favor of CSR is its role in mitigating negative environmental impacts. Companies that adopt sustainable practices not only reduce their carbon footprint but also position themselves as leaders in innovation. For example, reducing waste and using renewable energy sources can lower operational costs while contributing to a healthier planet.\nMoreover, CSR initiatives can drive employee engagement and attract top talent. When companies prioritize social and environmental causes, employees feel a sense of pride and purpose in their work. This, in turn, boosts productivity and reduces turnover rates.\nCritics argue that CSR diverts resources from profit generation. However, the long-term benefits-such as enhanced brand loyalty, risk management, and access to socially conscious markets-far outweigh the costs. In conclusion, corporate social responsibility is not just a moral obligation but a strategic advantage.

[SEP] Response: ToAll\nJosh,\n\nWe really have to make a decision about our business. Our landlord just wrote me another letter about the rent. Next month, it will be raised 25% to $4,500 per month. That's going to eat even more into our profits. I mean, Josh, that's $54,000 a year!\n\nI'm going to summarize our discussions here. I know that you are strongly in favor of just staying where we are and paying the higher rent. The obvious disadvantages of that are that our sales of clothing are increasing more slowly than our expenses AND with the rapid growth in Centerville, we can expect further rent increases in the coming months. The big pro for staying is that we're in a fashionable district where long-term customers know us. We're right downtown, so customers can come in on their lunch breaks to be measured for a suit or other high-end clothing.\n\nYou know that I favor going to a completely different model. We move to the south end of town for making the clothes, but create a system where we meet people in their offices or schools to measure them for new clothes. We also open up a much better webpage than what we have now so that customers can view our clothing options and enter their measurements. Incredible cost savings! The con of that is that we lose the showroom, where customers can just come in and look at the possibilities, feel the cloth and talk to us about what would be appropriate for them. Far less personalized service, which has helped us build close relationships with our customers.\n\nHonestly, I'd like another option, but I'm out of ideas. Should we talk to more people? I'm up for anything, but we really DO need to make a decision!\n\nThanks!\n\nKen", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I believe that companies do have a responsibility to society. While profit is essential for business sustainability, integrating CSR can lead to long-term benefits for both the company and the community. By balancing profit-making with social contributions, companies can build a positive reputation, foster customer loyalty, and create a more sustainable future.\nAccording to economist Milton Friedman, the primary responsibility of a business is to increase its profits. Businesses are accountable to their shareholders, not society at large.\nCompanies often have a significant impact on the communities where they operate. By engaging in CSR, they can contribute positively to these communities, fostering goodwill and mutual support.d part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community. – James.W@efstudent.com Against CSR The problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility.

[SEP] Response: One legendary creature I find very interesting is the Wendigo, a mythical monster from Native American folklore, especially among the Algonquian-speaking tribes in North America. The Wendigo is said to be a spirit or creature that appears in cold, snowy forests and is often associated with greed, hunger, and isolation.\n \nAccording to the legend, the Wendigo was once a human who became possessed by an evil spirit after turning to cannibalism during a harsh winter. As punishment, the person transformed into a monster—tall, thin, with glowing eyes, sharp teeth, and a heart made of ice. No matter how much it eats, the Wendigo is always hungry, constantly searching for more victims to satisfy its endless craving.\n \nThe story of the Wendigo was used as a warning against selfishness and losing one’s humanity in desperate times. It also served as a way to explain strange disappearances or dangerous behavior during long winters.\n \nMany books, movies, and games now feature the Wendigo, turning it into a popular creature beyond its original folklore. It remains one of the most chilling and fascinating monsters in North American mythology.", "label": 5}

I've been lucky enough to travel around the world and do business with many different people in many different countries. What I've learned is that understanding cross-cultural differences is critical for successful communication.\n\nFor example, people from my culture are apt to maintain eye contact in a conversation.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Training Provider Recommendation Report\n\nAfter evaluating two potential training providers—TrainQuick and Skills Pro—I recommend selecting Skills Pro as our preferred training partner.\n\nTrainQuick offers low-cost and flexible course options, which are appealing from a budgeting standpoint. However, it has seen limited engagement in other branches. Furthermore, feedback indicates that employees are dissatisfied when grouped with staff from different branches during sessions, impacting overall learning satisfaction and participation.\n\nIn contrast, Skills Pro, while more expensive, provides a higher-quality learning experience. Although some participants report the course material as challenging, completion rates are consistently high. This indicates strong program design and learner support. Additionally, Skills Pro has announced plans to expand its course offerings, which suggests a commitment to growth and continued relevance in the training space.\n\nGiven these considerations, Skills Pro represents better long-term value. Its focus on quality and learner outcomes aligns with our commitment to professional development. The investment is justified by stronger engagement, higher completion, and future scalability.\n\nRecommendation: Proceed with Skills Pro as our training provider of choice.", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 15-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Read Ken's email and then email Josh and Ken a third option. Use your imagination. You can create any facts about your city that will support your proposal. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi Ken and Josh,\n\nThanks for the email, Ken! I really liked both of your ideas. The beach getaway sounds relaxing, and the mountain retreat would definitely be peaceful and full of nature. But I’d like to suggest a third option that I think combines the best of both — a long weekend in Silverlake City!\n\nLet me tell you why I think it’s the perfect spot for us.\n\nSilverlake is located about halfway between both of you, which makes it a convenient meeting point. It's a mid-sized city with just under 500,000 people, so it’s lively without being overwhelming. It has a charming downtown with cafés, rooftop bars, bookstores, and plenty of live music — I know how much Josh enjoys jazz, and we have some great venues here!\n\nThe big attraction, though, is the lake itself. Silverlake is known for its stunning freshwater lake with crystal-clear waters surrounded by rolling green hills. There’s a beautiful 10-mile trail around the lake, which is great for biking or hiking, and there’s a kayak rental place if we want to get out on the water.\n\nThe city also hosts the Summer Lights Festival the weekend of July 15–17, and it’s one of our biggest annual events. There are food trucks, local art shows, outdoor movies, and even a drone light show every evening over the lake. I think it’d be a fun atmosphere for us to hang out, catch up, and enjoy something a bit different.\n\nAccommodation-wise, there are several cozy Airbnbs near the lakefront and even a boutique hotel called The Driftwood Lodge, which has great reviews. It’s affordable too — around $120 per night per room. If we book soon, we might even be able to get a group discount.\n\nTransportation shouldn’t be a problem either. Silverlake is serviced by a small regional airport (SLK), and if you’re driving, it’s just a 3.5-hour road trip from either of your cities. Once you’re here, everything is walkable or accessible by bike or scooter rentals.\n\nI’ve lived in Silverlake for about three years now, and every friend who visits ends up wanting to come back. The vibe is relaxed but not boring — there’s always something happening, and people are super friendly. Plus, the food scene is incredible! We’ve got everything from vegan bakeries to a new Korean barbecue place that’s been getting a lot of buzz.\n\nIf we plan it right, we could do a little bit of everything — spend the mornings hiking or paddleboarding, the afternoons exploring downtown, and the evenings enjoying music and good food. And if the weather holds up (which it usually does this time of year — sunny with highs in the mid-70s), it’ll be a perfect mix of adventure and relaxation.\n\nLet me know what you guys think. I’d be happy to take care of local arrangements — booking a place, making reservations, or getting tickets to the festival. Just give me the green light, and I’ll get things rolling!\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\n", "label": 5}

After some back-and-forth, the salesperson lowered the price to $18,500. I counteroffered $17,500, and we eventually agreed on a price of $18,000.

One of its principal advantages is that has a strong track record of employing highly qualified facilitators. The only major drawback of the product is its high cost.\nBy contrast, looking at the data, TrainQuick courses fall short on quality. The chief complaint from staff members was they disliked being placed in groups with random strangers and preferred to have joined classes with their own colleagues. TrainQuick is, of course, favorable in terms of cost-effectiveness.\n I believe Skills Pro represents the best option for us. However, one proviso I would add would be that, Skills Pro's courses content  people described as difficulty, but when started they finish course successfully.\n", "label": 3}

[SEP] Response: Subject: Exploring a Third Option for Our Project\n\nHi Josh and Ken,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. After reviewing Ken's email, I wanted to propose a third option that might be beneficial for our project.\n\nConsidering the vibrant and innovative atmosphere in Pune, I believe we can leverage some unique aspects of our city to enhance our project. Pune is known for its thriving tech industry and educational institutions, which could provide us with access to cutting-edge technology and a pool of talented professionals. Additionally, the city's rich cultural heritage and numerous green spaces offer a perfect blend of modernity and tradition, making it an ideal location for our project.\n\nOne idea is to collaborate with local universities and tech startups to integrate advanced technologies into our project. This could not only improve the quality but also attract more attention and investment. Furthermore, we could organize events in Pune's beautiful parks and historical sites to engage the community and promote our project.\n\nI believe this approach could provide us with a unique advantage and help us achieve our goals more effectively. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.\n\nBest regards, [Your Name]", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that‚Äôs popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most iconic legendary creatures in Mexican folklore is La Llorona, or The Weeping Woman. According to legend, she was once a beautiful woman named Maria who, driven by grief or vengeance, drowned her children in a river and was condemned to roam the earth for eternity.\n\nDraped in a flowing white dress, La Llorona is said to appear near rivers or lakes, crying for her lost children with the eerie wail, “¡Ay, mis hijos!” (“Oh, my children!”). Witnesses describe her as ghostly and sorrowful, often vanishing when approached.\n\nHer story serves as both a cautionary tale for children and a chilling reflection of guilt and tragedy. Beyond fear, La Llorona symbolizes the consequences of broken family bonds and the torment of remorse. Deeply rooted in colonial-era myths and indigenous beliefs, her legend has endured through centuries, evolving into a cultural icon that inspires films, literature, and urban legends throughout Latin America.\n\nIn essence, La Llorona is more than a ghost—she is a haunting embodiment of sorrow and punishment. Her cries still echo in the collective imagination of a nation.", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: One of the strongest pillars of the company I work for is corporate social responsibility (CSR), and I couldn’t be more proud of that! I truly believe that all companies should embrace this sense of responsibility, considering the significant impact they have on local communities.\nSome people argue that CSR is nothing more than a cheap marketing tool to create a good public image. While it’s true that CSR can enhance a company's reputation, its benefits go far beyond that. Studies have shown that companies with strong CSR programs experience higher employee satisfaction, lower turnover rates, and increased productivity. Consumers also value these efforts — many take a company’s social and environmental practices into account before making a purchase.\nCSR is not just about giving back; it's a two-way street. When companies invest in the well-being of the community, they’re also investing in their own long-term success. A healthier, more stable society creates a better environment for business to thrive.\nIn short, I believe that companies have a responsibility not just to their shareholders, but to society as a whole. Profit and purpose can, and should, go hand in hand. To receive great returns, you must be willing to make meaningful investments — and CSR is one of the smartest investments a company can make.", "label": 5}

Aqui está um texto em inglês com cerca de 150 linhas, dividido em parágrafos temáticos para facilitar a leitura.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 8-Intermediate [SEP] Prompt: Read the list of issues that you need to discuss with your boss. Then write only the body of an email to your boss. You do not need to write the addresses, greetings or the closing. Use a formal tone. Type in the input box. Write 80-100 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Possibilities are everywhere. They surround us in ways we often do not notice. Each day, when we wake up, we are presented with countless choices and opportunities that can shape our future. Possibilities give us hope, direction, and purpose. They allow us to dream and to imagine a better version of ourselves and the world around us.\n\nFrom a young age, we are taught to believe in possibilities. We are encouraged to think about what we want to become, where we want to go, and what we want to achieve. These possibilities inspire us to study, to work hard, and to never give up. Without them, life would seem dull and predictable.\n\nPossibilities exist in every part of our lives. In education, we have the possibility to learn new subjects, explore new ideas, and discover our passions. In friendships, we have the possibility to meet new people, to build strong connections, and to share experiences that change us forever. In careers, possibilities give us the chance to try different jobs, to develop skills, and to find work that makes us happy.\n\nThe future is full of possibilities. We do not always know what will happen tomorrow or next year, but this uncertainty can be exciting. It reminds us that there is always room for change and growth. A small decision today can open the door to big opportunities tomorrow.\n\nSometimes, possibilities can feel scary. We might be afraid to take risks because we do not want to fail. But it is important to remember that failure is part of exploring possibilities. When we fail, we learn. And when we learn, we grow stronger.\n\nTechnology has created new possibilities for us. The internet connects us to people all over the world. We can learn online, work from home, and even build businesses from our bedrooms. New inventions give us the possibility to solve problems that seemed impossible in the past.\n\nNature also reminds us of possibilities. A tiny seed can become a tall tree. A single drop of water can help a plant grow. Just like in nature, small actions in our lives can lead to big results.\n\nPossibilities are not just about personal success. They are also about making the world a better place. We have the possibility to help others, to protect the environment, and to create a future where everyone has the chance to live well. Every good action we take opens up more positive possibilities for others.\n\nBelieving in possibilities means having hope. Even when times are hard, possibilities remind us that things can change. A bad day can be followed by a good one. A problem can lead to a solution. A mistake can teach us a valuable lesson.\n\nPossibilities are like doors waiting to be opened. But we must have the courage to turn the handle. We must be curious, brave, and willing to try new things. Only then can we discover what lies beyond.\n\nWhen we think about possibilities, we begin to see life as a great adventure. We see challenges as opportunities to learn. We see differences as chances to understand new ideas. We see the unknown as something exciting rather than something to fear.\n\nPossibilities make life meaningful. They remind us that we can always change our story. No matter where we come from, how old we are, or what challenges we face, we can choose to believe in a future full of possibilities.\n\nSo, let us open our minds and our hearts. Let us welcome the many possibilities that life offers. And let us work together to turn these possibilities into reality.\n\nBecause in the end, it is our belief in possibilities that shapes the world we live in.", "label": 0}

Work stress can be overwhelming, especially when management doesn't recognize the effort you and your colleagues put in. If staying isn't working for you, maybe it's worth considering other opportunities where your hard work is valued.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Challenges in Language Learning\n\nLearning a new language can be an exciting but challenging journey. One of the most common difficulties students face is building vocabulary. It takes time and repetition to remember new words and use them correctly in context. Another major challenge is pronunciation, especially when the sounds in the new language don’t exist in the learner’s native tongue.\n\nGrammar rules can also be confusing. Many students struggle with verb tenses, sentence structure, or articles. These rules often differ greatly from their first language, making it hard to apply them naturally. In addition, listening and speaking skills can be difficult to develop without regular practice. Learners may feel nervous or embarrassed when speaking, which can slow their progress.\n\nMotivation is another key issue. Language learning requires consistency and patience, and it’s easy to feel discouraged when progress seems slow. Finally, cultural differences can affect understanding.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: report to Fabio \"Recommendation for Employee Training Provider\"\nI recommend Skills Pro as the preferred training provider following a review of two potential companies: TrainQuick and Skills Pro.\n\nTrainQuick offers cost-effective and flexible training solutions. However, feedback indicates a lack of engagement and utilization in another branch. A significant concern raised by employees is their dissatisfaction with mixed-branch classes. This suggests that while financially attractive, TrainQuick may not meet our employees' specific learning environment preferences or engagement needs.\n\nIn contrast, Skills Pro, though more expensive, demonstrates superior outcomes. Despite some participants finding the course content challenging, there is a high success rate among those who complete it. This indicates a robust and effective curriculum. Furthermore, Skills Pro's plans for course expansion suggest a commitment to evolving and comprehensive training offerings.\n\nConsidering the importance of training quality and successful employee development, Skills Pro is the recommended choice. While the initial investment is higher, the demonstrated effectiveness and potential for future growth align better with our long-term training objectives.", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Formal Report: Recommendation for a Training Company\n\nAfter reviewing two training companies, TrainQuick and Skills Pro, I would like to recommend Skills Pro for our future employee training programs.\n\nTrainQuick is an affordable and flexible option; however, it has not been successful in engaging employees from our other branch. Feedback indicates that staff feel uncomfortable when mixed with participants from other branches during classes. As a result, the attendance rate has been low, and the overall effectiveness of the training has been questioned.\n\nOn the other hand, although Skills Pro is more expensive, it offers a higher quality training experience. Some employees described the course content as challenging, but the majority of participants who enroll complete the course successfully. This shows that the program is effective and well-structured. Additionally, Skills Pro has plans to expand its course offerings, which will provide us with more training options in the future.\n\nConsidering the importance of quality training for employee development and long-term company growth, I believe that Skills Pro is the best choice despite the higher cost.

[SEP] Response: Formal Training Program Recommendation: Skills Pro\nDate: June 23, 2025\nTo:Skills Pro  \nFrom: Rainer de Bastos Bueno Morais\n Subject: Recommendation for Training Program Provider\nThis report outlines the evaluation of potential training providers and presents a formal recommendation for the upcoming training initiative. Following a comprehensive review, two companies, TrainQuick and Skills Pro, were considered based on their offerings and suitability\nfor our organizational needs.\nTrainQuick was assessed for its cost-effectiveness and flexible scheduling. However, significant concerns arose regarding employee feedback. It was noted that employees expressed dissatisfaction with the mixed-branch training environment, hindering the overall learning experience and potentially reducing engagement.\nIn contrast, Skills Pro, while a more significant financial investment, has received positive feedback concerning its course content quality. Participants consistently describe the material as good and relevant. Although some individuals have found the completion of courses\nchallenging, Skills Pro has indicated plans for course expansion, which may address this in the future. The primary objective of the training is to enhance skills effectively, and the quality of content provided by Skills Pro is a critical factor in achieving this.\nConsidering the paramount importance of effective content and the potential for future improvements, it is formally recommended that we proceed with Skills Pro as our training provider. While the higher cost and current completion challenges are acknowledged, the superior content quality is deemed crucial for the long-term success and impact of the training program.", "label": 5}

You can create any facts about your city that will support your proposal. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi Ken and Josh,\n\nI've reviewed your suggestions for our Saturday outing and propose a third option that combines the best of both worlds: a picnic in Elmwood City Park followed by a volunteer cleanup.\n\nElmwood Park boasts a beautiful, newly renovated picnic area with stunning views of the city skyline. We can enjoy a relaxed lunch together, catching up and enjoying the pleasant weather. Following the picnic, we can contribute to our community by participating in a park cleanup. Our city's \"Green Elmwood\" initiative is always looking for volunteers, and this would be a great way to give back while spending time together. The park provides all necessary equipment, and it's a rewarding way to end a fun day.\n\nThis option offers relaxation and community engagement, addressing both your preferences. Let me know your thoughts. We can coordinate details, such as what to bring for the picnic, once we agree on this option.\n\nBest, Regards\nMiriam GLZ]", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 15-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: One common issue is vocabulary retention. Memorizing new words can feel overwhelming, especially when they don’t have direct equivalents in the student’s native language. This leads to confusion and frustration. How can students overcome this? Using techniques like spaced repetition, flashcards, and context-based learning can help solidify new vocabulary.\n\nAnother challenge is pronunciation. Many languages have sounds that don’t exist in the student’s first language, making it hard to pronounce words correctly. This can lead to misunderstandings or embarrassment. Students can work on pronunciation by listening to native speakers, imitating their speech, and practicing in real-life situations.\n\nMoreover, grammar is often a major stumbling block. The rules for word order, verb conjugations, and tenses can be completely different from what students are used to. This creates confusion, especially when trying to form complex sentences. Is there a way to tackle grammar? Breaking it down into smaller, manageable chunks and focusing on one aspect at a time can ease the process.\n\nLastly, motivation is a significant factor. Language learning requires consistent effort, but progress can feel slow. Setting small, achievable goals, celebrating milestones, and immersing oneself in the language can help keep motivation high.", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Reading is one of the most powerful tools for personal growth, education, and entertainment. From a young age, people are encouraged to read not only to develop language skills but also to expand their understanding of the world. Books open doors to new ideas, different cultures, and alternate viewpoints, helping readers become more empathetic and informed individuals. Beyond fiction, reading nonfiction provides practical knowledge on countless subjects, from science and history to personal finance and mental health. In today’s digital world, while videos and podcasts are popular, reading still plays a unique role. It allows people to engage with content at their own pace, reflect on what they’ve read, and build critical thinking skills. Furthermore, regular reading has been linked to improved focus, stronger memory, and even reduced stress. Whether it’s a printed novel, an academic journal, or an eBook, making reading a daily habit enriches both the mind and the soul.\n", "label": 0}

It sounds like you're going through a tough time, and it's completely okay to feel overwhelmed.\n\nAbout work: it’s frustrating when your efforts aren’t recognized.

It is a solitary and territorial animal, relying on stealth and strength to hunt prey such as deer, wild boar, and occasionally livestock.\n\nDespite its iconic status, the Royal Bengal Tiger faces threats from habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.

Mahadevpuram is quickly developing into an artsy, upscale neighborhood, attracting young professionals and tourists alike.

Plus, with local events like the weekly \"Street Style Bazaar,\" we’ll be right in the middle of a fashion-conscious crowd looking for unique clothing—exactly our niche.\nLet’s discuss this option seriously.

[SEP] Response: After taking a close look at two training companies, TrainQuick and Skills Pro, we're leaning towards recommending Skills Pro for our employee development needs. Here's why:\n\nTrainQuick is definitely more budget-friendly and offers flexible options, which is great on the surface. However, our team has mentioned that the sessions aren't very engaging, especially when they're mixed with participants from other branches. This setup seems to dampen the learning experience and might not give us the full advantage of what their courses could potentially offer.\n\nOn the other hand, Skills Pro comes with a higher price tag, but there's a lot to be said for their approach. Their courses are not just comprehensive but also challenging, and our employees have shown high completion rates, which speaks volumes about the effectiveness of their programs. Plus, Skills Pro is constantly expanding their course offerings, showing they're committed to keeping up with evolving training needs and maintaining quality.\n\nWe believe that investing in Skills Pro aligns perfectly with our goal of providing topnotch training that boosts both employee skills and productivity.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Companies have a big responsability on our environment, in our society and not only to their shareholders. Thinking of it, its correct that they help the communities where they operate. To this, there a lot of thinks that they can do, like adopting sustentable practices, offering fair wages, weaking the unutrishement with projects and leading projects of education. \nThis positioning helps the reputation of the company, the moral and ethical and also helps them for economical reasons, for example, adopting this ideas can help companies to reduce costs, improve their reputation and boost productivity. \nPeople may think that the real reason of the projects across the world of the corporations are only a cheap marketing device, but if its the case, at least this helps us in our run to help our society in the most important issues for the population. \nIt is right to think that beyond the moral and ethical reasons, the companies are economically advantaged of this point of view. Society is looking for change, so, consumers choose to support brands that show social and environmental responsibility. Because of this, I understand the argument that a business's main goal is to generate profit. However, profit and social responsibility don’t have to conflict. CSR can be a smart investment that supports long-term growth.\nFinally, while it’s true that governments create laws to protect the public, companies should not wait for legal pressure to do the right thing. Ethical behavior should come from within the organization, not just from external regulations.\nIn conclusion, CSR is not just a moral choice; it’s a practical one for businesses today.\n", "label": 4}

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi Harry,\n\nHere are some ideas for motivating your employees, along with a few pitfalls to avoid.\n\nWays to Motivate:\nIncentivize your team. Help employees feel that the company’s success is their success too. Rewards—big or small—can be powerful motivators.\n\nSupport career growth. Take a genuine interest in your employees’ development. Offer training opportunities and consider acting as a mentor.\n\nPromote work-life balance. Recognize that employees have lives outside of work. Respecting that makes for happier and more productive team members.\n\nListen actively. When people feel heard—even when they’re voicing concerns—they tend to feel more valued and stay more engaged.\n\nLead by example. Treat your team the way you’d want to be treated by your own leaders.\n\nWhat to Avoid:\nBeing disrespectful. Never belittle someone just because they’re in a junior role.\n\nTaking credit for others’ work. Always give credit where it’s due.\n\nLosing your temper. Staying calm, even under stress, sets a positive tone for the team.\n\nLetting others take the blame. Be fair and own your mistakes.\n\nForgetting to praise. A simple “great job” can go a long way.\n\nGood luck with your team!\n\n— EF student", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: **Corporate Social Responsibility: A Moral and Strategic Imperative**\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is no longer just a trend — it is an essential part of doing business in the modern world. Companies today are expected not only to generate profit but also to contribute positively to society and the environment. This dual responsibility strengthens public trust and ensures long-term sustainability.\n\nOne clear argument in favor of CSR is that businesses benefit from investing in the communities where they operate. Whether through environmental efforts, education programs, or fair labor practices, CSR helps build a loyal customer base and enhances brand reputation. For example, companies like Patagonia and Ben & Jerry’s are admired not only for their products but also for their commitment to social and environmental causes.\n\nCritics argue that CSR distracts companies from their main goal — making profit. However, research shows that socially responsible companies often perform better financially in the long term. CSR is not about charity; it is about integrating ethical practices into business strategies. In fact, today’s consumers and investors increasingly demand transparency and responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, CSR should not be viewed as an optional activity, but as a vital part of corporate identity. Companies that take CSR seriously help shape a more equitable and sustainable world — and in doing so, secure their own future. After all, doing good and doing well are not mutually exclusive.", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Hi Leon,\n\nI'm really sorry to hear you're going through such a rough time—it sounds like a lot to carry at once. First, with work: it’s incredibly frustrating when hard work isn’t recognized. If leaving isn’t an immediate option, maybe try setting some boundaries and focus on the aspects of the job you can control. Sometimes finding small wins or even confiding in a trusted colleague can help ease the pressure.\n\nAs for Tia, breakups (or the possibility of one) are always painful, especially when you had high hopes.

Originating from the indigenous Algonquian-speaking tribes of North America, the Wendigo is a fearsome spirit associated with winter, hunger, and cannibalism. It is often described as a gaunt, emaciated figure, towering and skeletal, with glowing eyes and sharp claws. The Wendigo is said to possess an insatiable hunger for human flesh, symbolizing greed and the destructive nature of unchecked desire.\n  According to legend, the Wendigo was once a human who was consumed by greed or resorted to cannibalism during harsh winters. This transformation cursed them into a monster doomed to roam the frozen wilderness eternally hungry. The creature embodies the dangers of isolation, starvation, and moral corruption, serving as a chilling warning to communities about the consequences of selfishness and desperation.\n  Despite its terrifying nature, the Wendigo remains a compelling figure in modern culture, appearing in books, movies, and video games, where it continues to evoke fear and fascination as a symbol of primal survival instincts gone wrong.\n", "label": 5}

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Harry,\n\nWelcome aboard, and congratulations on your new role! Motivating a team effectively starts with building trust and showing genuine interest in your team members as individuals. Take time to understand their strengths, career goals, and challenges. Recognize achievements both big and small—it boosts morale and reinforces positive behaviors.\n\nSet clear, achievable goals and communicate openly. When people know what’s expected and feel included in the bigger picture, they’re more likely to stay engaged. Empower your team by giving them ownership of their work and opportunities to grow. Listening actively and being open to feedback creates a culture of respect and collaboration.\n\nOn the other hand, avoid micromanaging—it can undermine confidence and lead to frustration. Similarly, be cautious about using fear or pressure as motivators. These might bring short-term results but harm trust and long-term performance.\n\nLastly, lead by example. Your attitude and behavior set the tone for the team. Stay positive, consistent, and approachable.\n\nWishing you great success in your leadership journey!\n\nBest regards,\nAnny", "label": 5}

Be approachable, consistent, and transparent in your communication. Encourage collaboration and celebrate both team and individual achievements. Show genuine interest in your employees' growth—offer mentorship, support training opportunities, and help them set meaningful career goals.\n\nMake sure people feel valued. A simple “thank you” or recognizing someone’s good work can go a long way. Promote a culture where feedback is constructive and two-way. Also, encourage a healthy work-life balance to prevent burnout.\n\nAvoid common demotivators like micromanaging, ignoring contributions, or taking credit for others’ efforts. Don’t overlook the importance of fairness—blaming others for mistakes or failing to acknowledge success can quickly damage morale.

His tales are recounted in various scriptures, including the Mahabharata and the Puranas, where he is celebrated for his role in rescuing his mother from bondage and securing the elixir of immortality, amrita, from the gods.\n\nGaruda is also prominent in Buddhist and Jain traditions, symbolizing wisdom and protection.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning can be a rewarding yet challenging endeavor. One of the primary issues students face is the fear of making mistakes. This fear can hinder speaking practice, which is crucial for fluency. How can students overcome this fear? Embracing a growth mindset and understanding that mistakes are a natural part of the learning process can help.\n\nAnother challenge is vocabulary retention. With so many new words to learn, how can students effectively memorize and recall them? Techniques such as spaced repetition, flashcards, and contextual learning can enhance vocabulary acquisition.\n\nAdditionally, students often struggle with pronunciation and listening comprehension. What strategies can be employed to improve these skills? Regular practice with native speakers, listening to podcasts, and using language learning apps can provide valuable exposure to authentic language use.\n\nCultural differences can also pose challenges. How can understanding cultural context aid language learning? Engaging with cultural materials, such as films and literature, can deepen comprehension and appreciation of the language.\n\nIn summary, language learners face various challenges, including fear of mistakes, vocabulary retention, pronunciation, and cultural understanding. By employing effective strategies and maintaining a positive attitude, students can navigate these obstacles and achieve their language learning goals.", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language can be an exciting journey, but it also comes with several challenges. Why do many people struggle when trying to learn a new language? One major issue is motivation. At first, students may feel excited, but over time, progress can seem slow, and they may become frustrated or bored. This leads to inconsistency in practice, which is key to success in language learning.\n\nAnother common challenge is the fear of making mistakes. Many students feel embarrassed when they speak incorrectly or don’t understand native speakers. However, making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process. Overcoming this fear is essential for improvement.\n\nTime management is also a big obstacle. Many learners have busy lives, and it’s difficult to find time for regular study. Without consistent practice, vocabulary and grammar are quickly forgotten.\n\nFinally, students often focus too much on grammar rules and not enough on real communication. It’s important to balance reading and writing with listening and speaking practice.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, language learners should set clear goals, practice daily (even if only for a few minutes), and seek opportunities to use the language in real-life situations. Watching movies, talking with native speakers, or using apps can make the process more enjoyable and effective.\n\nWith patience and the right strategies, anyone can succeed in learning a new language.", "label": 5}

The obvious disadvantages of that are that our sales of clothing are increasing more slowly than our expenses AND with the rapid growth in Centerville, we can expect further rent increases in the coming months.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 15-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning can be both exciting and challenging. Many students face difficulties when trying to master a new language. First, one major issue is vocabulary retention. Students often learn new words but struggle to remember them in real-life situations. Why does this happen? Usually, they don't get enough practice using the words actively, so the vocabulary doesn't become part of their long-term memory.\n\nAnother common challenge is pronunciation. Every language has unique sounds that may not exist in the learner’s native tongue. How can students overcome this? Regular listening and speaking practice, such as watching movies or talking with native speakers, can help improve pronunciation over time.\n\nGrammar is also a significant obstacle. Complex rules and exceptions can confuse learners. How can they address this? Breaking grammar into smaller parts and practicing each rule in context can make it easier to understand.\n\nLastly, motivation can decrease when progress feels slow. What can students do? Setting small, achievable goals and celebrating progress can keep motivation high.\n\nIn conclusion, while language learning presents many challenges, using effective strategies can help students succeed.\n\n\n", "label": 5}

Write 50-75 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Understanding Cultural Differences in the Workplace\n\nI work in an international company, and one of the most important lessons I have learned is the value of understanding cultural differences. Working with colleagues and clients from around the world has taught me that communication styles vary greatly depending on culture, and knowing these differences can make all the difference in building successful relationships.\n\nFor example, in my culture, people often greet each other with a firm handshake and smile. However, in some countries, a bow or a nod is the proper way to show respect. I once met a client who seemed distant at first, but later I realized that in their culture, maintaining a lot of personal space is a sign of respect, not coldness.\n\nAnother interesting difference is in the way people express disagreement. In my culture, it is normal to speak openly and directly, even if it means saying \"no\" or pointing out mistakes. In other cultures, people prefer to be more indirect to avoid causing embarrassment or offense. This sometimes caused confusion during meetings until I learned to read between the lines.\n\nI also noticed that humor can be very different from one culture to another. What is funny in one place may be confusing or even offensive in another. I once told a joke during a business lunch, and I could tell immediately that it didn’t land well. Since then, I have become more careful about humor in professional settings.\n\nBody language is another area full of surprises. For example, in some cultures, nodding means agreement, but in others, it simply means that the person is listening. Similarly, gestures that seem harmless to me may be rude or inappropriate elsewhere. I learned to observe carefully before using my usual expressions.\n\nOne thing that has helped me a lot is being patient and asking questions when I am unsure. People usually appreciate it when you show interest in their culture. It opens the door to better understanding and trust.\n\nOf course, adapting to different cultures does not mean losing your own identity. It means showing respect and willingness to learn. Even small efforts, like greeting people properly or avoiding sensitive topics, can build stronger connections.\n\nI believe that in today’s global workplace, cultural awareness is not just a nice skill to have—it is essential. The ability to communicate effectively across cultures helps avoid misunderstandings and creates a more inclusive and productive environment.\n\nIn conclusion, working internationally has taught me to be more open-minded and flexible. It has been a rewarding experience that has enriched both my professional and personal life. I encourage anyone who works with people from different backgrounds to take time to learn about their cultures. It makes work more enjoyable and successful.", "label": 5}

You can create any facts about your city that will support your proposal. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Technology has dramatically changed the world in which we live. From the invention of the wheel to the rise of the internet, every major technological advancement has shaped the way we interact with each other, the way we work, the way we live, and the way we think. In today’s digital age, the pace of technological development is faster than ever, and its impact on modern society is profound and far-reaching.\n\nOne of the most noticeable impacts of technology is on communication. Just a few decades ago, people relied heavily on letters, landline telephones, and face-to-face meetings to stay in touch. Today, with the proliferation of smartphones, social media, and instant messaging platforms, we are more connected than ever. People can talk to anyone, anywhere, at any time. This constant connectivity has created a global society where cultural exchange is common, and long-distance relationships—whether personal or professional—are easier to maintain.\n\nHowever, this convenience comes at a cost. While digital communication has made it easier to connect, it has also led to a decrease in the depth and quality of many interpersonal relationships. Face-to-face communication is being replaced by text messages and voice notes. Emotions can be misunderstood, and the lack of physical presence can lead to feelings of isolation. Social media platforms, though meant to bring people together, often cause anxiety, depression, and unrealistic comparisons.\n", "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: Good afternoon.\nBased on the research we conducted, two training providers, TrainQuick and Skills Pro, were evaluated for potential implementation. TrainQuick was identified as a cost-effective and flexible option; however, it has not been adopted by employees in the other branch. Additionally, concerns were raised regarding the integration of participants from different branches within the same training sessions, which has been met with resistance by staff.\n\nIn contrast, Skills Pro was found to be more expensive. Despite this, the course content—though described by some as challenging—has been successfully completed by many participants. Furthermore, plans to expand the course offering have been communicated, indicating a commitment to continuous improvement and scalability.\n\nBased on the findings, Skills Pro is being considered as the preferred option. While the cost is higher, the quality of the training and the positive completion outcomes suggest that the investment may be justified. Emphasis has been placed on the importance of delivering a high-quality learning experience that aligns with organizational goals and employee development needs.\n\nA final decision is expected to be made shortly, with the recommendation leaning toward Skills Pro due to its demonstrated effectiveness and future growth potential.\n\nBest.\nAna", "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: You are writing to Harry, a new manager in your company. He wants advice on how to effectively motivate his team and what strategies to avoid. Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Motivating employees is an essential for maintaining a productive and positive work environment. To do this, leaders should offer incentives that make employees feel valued and connected to the company's success. Supporting their professional growth through training and mentorship also helps build loyalty and trust. Encouraging a healthy work life balance shows that the company respects their personal lives, which can improve overall satisfaction. Listening to employees and treating them with respect, regardless of their position, creates a sense of belonging and fairness. However, certain behaviors can have the opposite effect. Disrespecting subordinates, takes credit for their work, losing your temper, blaming others unfairly, and failing to give praise can significantly lower morale and motivation. Leaders who avoid these negative actions and focus on positive reinforcement and open communication are more likely to build strong, motivated teams. A balanced approach to leadership ensures both employee happiness and organizational success.", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning is a rewarding yet challenging endeavor. Students often face several issues and challenges during their journey.\n\nWhat are the common difficulties in language learning? One major challenge is vocabulary acquisition. Memorizing new words and their meanings can be daunting, especially when they don't have direct translations in the learner's native language. Pronunciation is another hurdle; mastering the sounds and intonations of a new language requires consistent practice and often, guidance from native speakers.\n\nHow do cultural differences impact language learning? Cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions can be perplexing. Understanding the context in which certain phrases are used is crucial for effective communication. For instance, humor and sarcasm can be particularly tricky to grasp and use appropriately.\n\nWhat role does motivation play? Maintaining motivation over time is essential but challenging. Initial enthusiasm can wane, especially when progress seems slow. Setting realistic goals and celebrating small victories can help sustain motivation.\n\nHow does the learning environment affect progress? A supportive learning environment is vital. Access to resources like language apps, books, and conversation partners can significantly enhance the learning experience. Conversely, a lack of such resources can hinder progress.\n\nWhat strategies can help overcome these challenges? Consistent practice, exposure to the language through media, and engaging with native speakers are effective strategies. Joining language learning communities can provide support and encouragement.\n\nIn conclusion, while language learning presents various challenges, understanding and addressing these issues can lead to a more successful and enjoyable learning experience.

You can create any facts about your city that will support your proposal. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi Ken,\n\nI understand the urgency of your situation and appreciate the clarity you've provided regarding the challenges and potential strategies for your business. Let's break down the options and consider a balanced approach that aligns with your goals and the current market dynamics.\n\n---\n\n### 🏢 Option 1: Stay and Absorb the Rent Increase\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Established presence in a fashionable, high-traffic downtown area.\n* Strong brand recognition among long-term customers.\n* Convenient location for clients seeking in-person fittings.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* The 25% rent increase to \\$4,500/month equates to an additional \\$54,000 annually.\n* Rising operational costs and slower sales growth may strain profitability.\n* Potential for further rent hikes due to Centerville's rapid growth.\n\nIndustry benchmarks suggest that rent should not exceed 10-12% of total revenue to maintain financial health. With the new rent, your business would need to generate approximately \\$540,000 to \\$600,000 annually just to cover rent, which may be challenging given current sales trends. ([dojobusiness.com][1])\n\n---\n\n### 🚐 Option 2: Transition to a Mobile Tailoring Model\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Significant reduction in overhead costs by eliminating the need for a physical storefront.\n* Flexibility to serve clients at their locations, enhancing convenience and potentially expanding your customer base.\n* Opportunity to invest in a robust online presence, allowing customers to view clothing options and submit measurements digitally.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Loss of the showroom experience, which has been integral to building customer relationships.\n* Initial investment required for outfitting a mobile unit and developing an enhanced digital platform.\n* Potential challenges in maintaining the personalized service that has set your brand apart.([finmodelslab.com][2])\n\nStudies indicate that businesses emphasizing personalized services can see a boost in profit margins by an average of 15% compared to those offering traditional in-shop services. ([businessplan-templates.com][3])\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 Hybrid Approach: Combining the Best of Both Worlds\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n* Maintain a smaller, cost-effective physical presence that serves as a fitting and consultation hub.\n* Expand mobile services to reach clients at their locations, offering convenience and flexibility.\n* Develop a comprehensive online platform where customers can explore clothing options, submit measurements, and schedule fittings.([finmodelslab.com][4])\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* Retain the personal touch and brand identity associated with in-person interactions.\n* Reduce reliance on a large physical space, thereby lowering overhead costs.\n* Leverage technology to enhance customer experience and streamline operations.\n\nImplementing dynamic pricing strategies and expanding revenue streams through online sales and personalized services can further bolster profitability. ([finmodelslab.com][4])\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 Recommendation\n\nConsidering the financial strain posed by the upcoming rent increase and the evolving retail landscape, a hybrid approach seems prudent. By maintaining a modest physical presence while expanding mobile services and enhancing your online platform, you can mitigate costs, retain customer relationships, and position your business for sustainable growth.\n\nI recommend initiating discussions with your landlord to explore options for a more manageable lease agreement. Simultaneously, begin planning the logistics for a mobile unit and the development of an improved online platform. This dual approach will provide flexibility and adaptability in the face of changing market conditions.\n\nPlease let me know if you need assistance in outlining a detailed implementation plan or if you'd like to explore specific aspects of this strategy further.\n\nBest regards,\nJosh\n\n[1]: https://dojobusiness.com/blogs/news/clothing-store-business-plan?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"23 Data For The Business Plan Of A Clothing Store – BusinessDojo\"\n[2]: https://finmodelslab.com/blogs/startup-costs/high-end-tailoring-service?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Affordable Tailoring Business: A Cost Breakdown\"\n[3]: https://businessplan-templates.com/blogs/startup-costs/tailor?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"What Are the 9 Startup Costs Tailoring Your Business? – Businessplan-templates.com\"\n[4]: https://finmodelslab.com/blogs/how-much-makes/clothing-store?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Income Potential for Clothing Store Owners\"\n", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a vital aspect of modern business, reflecting the idea that companies should contribute positively to society beyond generating profits. Businesses do not exist in isolation—they depend on employees, consumers, communities, and the environment. Therefore, embracing CSR can lead to long-term sustainability, benefiting both society and the company itself.\nOne major argument in favor of CSR is that companies have a moral obligation to support the communities in which they operate. This includes fair wages, ethical labor practices, environmental sustainability, and charitable initiatives. By addressing social and environmental concerns, businesses can build trust and loyalty among consumers, improving brand reputation and customer retention. A company known for ethical and responsible practices is more likely to attract engaged employees and dedicated customers.\nAdditionally, CSR can drive long-term financial success. Sustainable business models, fair employee benefits, and responsible supply chains ensure operational efficiency and lower costs over time. Many consumers today prefer to buy from companies that align with their values, meaning that strong CSR initiatives can directly impact profitability.\nHowever, opponents argue that a company’s primary duty is to maximize shareholder value. They believe that CSR may divert resources from innovation and competitiveness, making companies less efficient. Some critics suggest that CSR efforts are often superficial—used as marketing strategies rather than genuine commitments to social change.\nUltimately, the most effective approach is a balance. Companies should prioritize profits while integrating CSR in meaningful ways that contribute to society. Ethical businesses tend to thrive in the long run, proving that responsibility and profitability can go hand in hand.\n\n\n", "label": 5}

You can create any facts about your city that will support your proposal. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Subject: Urgent Decision Needed on Rent Increase and Future Plans\n\nFrom: Ken\nTo: Josh\n\nHi Josh,\n\nWe really need to make a decision about the future of our business. Our landlord sent me another letter, and starting next month, the rent will increase by 25%, bringing it to $4,500 per month. That’s a significant jump and will cut even deeper into our profits—$54,000 annually!\n\nTo summarize where we stand, I know you’re leaning toward staying put and absorbing the higher rent. The main advantage of that is that we’re in a prime, fashionable district where we have a loyal customer base. The central location also allows us to attract busy professionals who can come by during lunch to get measured for suits and other high-end clothing. However, the downside is that our clothing sales are growing slower than our rising expenses, and with the rapid growth in Centerville, we can expect further rent hikes in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, I’m still in favor of transitioning to a different model. I propose relocating our manufacturing to the south end of town, but creating a system where we meet customers in their offices or schools for measurements. We could also build a much better website, showcasing our clothing options and allowing customers to submit their measurements online. This would offer significant cost savings. The downside, of course, is that we'd lose our showroom—customers wouldn’t be able to come in to browse, touch fabrics, and experience the personalized service that has helped us build strong relationships with them.\n\nI’ve been thinking about other alternatives, but honestly, I’m running out of ideas. Do you think we should talk to more people about our options? I’m open to anything, but we do need to make a decision soon.\n\nThanks,\nKen", "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: Feeling stressed is a common experience, and it's important to acknowledge and address it. Stress can manifest in various ways, such as feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or physically tense. It's crucial to identify the sources of your stress, whether they are work-related, personal, or a combination of factors.\n\nOne effective way to manage stress is through mindfulness and relaxation techniques. Practices like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga can help calm your mind and reduce physical tension. Additionally, regular physical activity is a great stress reliever, as it releases endorphins that improve your mood.\n\nTalking to someone you trust about your feelings can also be incredibly helpful. Whether it's a friend, family member, or therapist, sharing your concerns can provide relief and new perspectives. Organizing your tasks and setting realistic goals can help you feel more in control and reduce feelings of being overwhelmed.\n\nIt's also important to take breaks and engage in activities you enjoy. Hobbies, reading, or simply spending time in nature can provide a much-needed mental break. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and prioritize your well-being.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: My take on CSR\nBy Vale322 at 17:25, today\n\nCSR, or corporate social responsibility, has been a big topic of discussion in recent years. It refers to companies taking responsibility for the impact their actions have upon their workforce, their community and the world – which, for me, should be an essential part of any operating business.\n\nAs an integral part of society, corporations should help the communities where they operate. By sponsoring improvements in local education, the company is actually cultivating its future workforce. And on a global scale, operating sustainably helps ensure that all businesses have adequate resources to operate in the future. As members of the local community, businesses should support community development by sponsoring local projects and donations. A company should also to pay even its lowest employees a livable salary and make sure they work in a hazard-free office. \nIn addition,  companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n\nSome critics believe CSR is just a publicity stunt, nothing more than a marketing device to manipulate public perception. While it may be true that a company needs to maintain its public image, and CSR is a good method of doing that, we must not ignore the fact that this oftentimes is a win-win situation. If a company ensures fair benefits for its staff, it usually enjoys less turnover and higher productivity.\n\nTo sum up, I believe CSR should be an innate part of business operations. Consistent adherence to corporate social responsibility principles can help the company and its shareholders, as well as people in need in the local community and around the world.", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Language students often face a variety of issues and challenges during their language journey. One common difficulty is mastering pronunciation and listening skills, especially when souns in the new language do not exist in their native tongue. \nIn this situation, one thing learners need to do is spending a lot of time listening to the language they learn. It can be music, podcasts, youtube, cartoons or series etc. However, students must be cautious when choosing the right content in order to actually understand the meaning of what was said. Because otherwise this kind of practise will not matter.\nEventually, after doing this for long enough, students will get the hang of the language and will realise that pronouncig new sound is actually a a lot easyer than they thought before. \nBut the best practise will always come from a native speaker. Even after learning the language for several years, people might find it surprisingly difficult to speak to natives. Still, they should not be afraid to speak up, but should keep in mind that everything comes naturally with the practice.", "label": 3}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: My Opinion on Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is no longer just a trend—it’s a necessity. In today’s world, companies are expected to do more than simply make profits. They must also contribute positively to society and the environment. I believe CSR is essential, both for ethical reasons and for long-term business success.\n\nTo begin with, companies have significant influence and resources. This gives them the power—and the responsibility—to help solve social and environmental problems. Whether it’s reducing carbon emissions, supporting local communities, or ensuring fair labor practices, businesses have the means to make a real difference. For example, some companies now use sustainable packaging or donate a portion of their profits to charities. These actions not only help society but also improve the company’s public image.\n\nFurthermore, CSR can bring real benefits to businesses. It builds customer trust, attracts socially conscious investors, and improves employee satisfaction. People prefer to work for and buy from companies that share their values. In the long term, being socially responsible can even increase profits.\n\nHowever, CSR must be genuine. Some companies use it only for marketing, without making meaningful changes. This kind of “greenwashing” can harm a company’s reputation.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly support CSR. When done sincerely, it benefits both society and the business itself. It is not just the right thing to do—it is also the smart thing to do.\n\n", "label": 5}

With constant notifications, tight deadlines, and increasing professional expectations, it’s easy to become overwhelmed and burned out. This is why prioritizing mental well-being and creating boundaries is essential. Taking regular breaks, setting specific work hours, and making time for hobbies or physical activity can greatly enhance both productivity and personal satisfaction. Employers, too, play a crucial role by encouraging flexible schedules and promoting a culture of understanding and support. Remote work and hybrid models have opened new opportunities to reimagine how and where we work, offering more autonomy to employees. However, this freedom also requires discipline and clear communication. Ultimately, achieving balance is not a one-size-fits-all solution; it varies for each person depending on their responsibilities, lifestyle, and goals.

[SEP] Response: I know we looked at two training companies: TrainQuick and Skills Pro.\nBut, i think it should be considered Skills Pro as a better option:\nSkills Pro: more expensive; people have described the course content as difficult, but people who take the course often finish it successfully. They plan to expand the course, too.\nYes, it´s more expensive, but it has better quality and shown great finishing rates than TrainQuick, we should really invest in them, TrainQuick has too many flaws like mixing different branchs together, and aren´t being used in other branchs, meanwhile Skills Pro has been show to be used more on the long-term and useful, with them soon expanding the course.\n\nIts better for us as we can´t afford people not using the courses like in TrainQuick, we should totally go with Skills Pro as our final choice, it´s better for our long term.", "label": 2}

The gardens will feature native plants, herbs, and vegetables, encouraging biodiversity and reducing the urban heat island effect.\n\nWe seek funding and support to cover initial setup costs, educational workshops, and ongoing maintenance.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: My Opinion on Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is no longer just a trend; it has become a fundamental expectation in today’s business world. In my opinion, CSR plays a crucial role in shaping a company’s image, building customer trust, and contributing positively to society.\n\nFirstly, companies that invest in social and environmental projects often gain a better reputation. Consumers are becoming more conscious of where they spend their money. For example, many people now prefer to buy from brands that support sustainability or social causes. This shift in consumer behavior shows that CSR can be a competitive advantage.\n\nSecondly, CSR helps strengthen the relationship between businesses and local communities. Companies that support educational programs, healthcare initiatives, or environmental protection projects are seen as responsible and caring organizations. A good example is how some large supermarkets have reduced plastic use and promoted recycling, gaining public approval.\n\nLastly, CSR can increase employee satisfaction and motivation. People like to work for companies that share their values. When employees feel proud of their workplace, productivity and loyalty often increase.\n\nIn conclusion, CSR is not just about giving money to charity. It’s about making long-term, meaningful contributions to society while strengthening the company’s brand and internal culture. In my view, every company, regardless of size, should prioritize corporate social responsibility.", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Do you believe companies have a responsibility to society? Or do you think a company's only responsibility is to its shareholders? We invite you to join this discussion by posting your opinion on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nFor CSR\n\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925", "label": 0}

In my culture, respect for personal space is very important, so we tend to keep a little distance when speaking. Direct eye contact is usually avoided, as it can be seen as confrontational. Also, we often use polite, indirect language to avoid sounding too blunt. It’s key to adapt and be aware of these cultural differences, especially in professional settings.

[SEP] Response: Negotiation is a strategic discussion aimed at reaching a mutual agreement between two or more parties. It plays a vital role in business, politics, and daily interactions. The process typically involves preparation, the exchange of information, bargaining, and finalizing an agreement. Effective negotiation requires clear communication, active listening, emotional intelligence, and a focus on both interests and positions. Common negotiation styles include competitive, collaborative, and compromising approaches. Successful negotiators seek win-win outcomes where all sides feel satisfied with the result. Techniques such as BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement) and ZOPA (Zone of Possible Agreement) are often used to guide decisions. Ultimately, the goal of negotiation is to resolve differences, build relationships, and create value for all involved.", "label": 0}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most fascinating legendary creatures from Japan is the Kitsune, or fox spirit. Kitsune are intelligent foxes that possess magical abilities and are a staple of Japanese folklore. They are often depicted as shape-shifters, capable of taking on human form, typically that of a beautiful woman. This transformation ability is not merely a trick; it symbolizes the Kitsune's intelligence and cunning nature.\n\nKitsune are associated with the Shinto deity Inari, the god of rice, fertility, and prosperity, and are considered to be Inari's messengers. This connection imbues them with a dual nature: they can be both benevolent and malevolent. Benevolent Kitsune are known to protect and bring good fortune to those they encounter, often rewarding those who treat them with respect. Conversely, malevolent Kitsune might play tricks on humans, leading them astray or causing mischief.\n\nA unique feature of the Kitsune is their multiple tails, which can range from one to nine. It is said that the more tails a Kitsune has, the older and more powerful it is. A nine-tailed Kitsune, or \"Kyūbi no Kitsune,\" is particularly powerful and wise, embodying the pinnacle of Kitsune magic and mystique.", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that‚Äôs popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Growing up in India, stories of many legendary creatures fascinated and terrified me at the same time. Rakshasas are mythical beings that pop up frequently in our ancient texts, like the Ramayana and Mahabharata. Usually they're described as fearsome demons with sharp claws, fiery eyes, and the creepy ability to shapeshift. But the most interesting part about Rakshasas is that they're not purely evil. Take Ravana, for instance, the infamous Rakshasa king from the Ramayana. Sure, he kidnapped Sita and started a huge war, but he was also incredibly intelligent, brave, and devoted to the gods. He wasn't just a villain; he was complex, human-like. These creatures symbolize the inner struggles we all face, our anger, greed, or jealousy. Rakshasas remind us that everyone battles their own demons. Even today, whenever I hear about them, it makes me reflect on human nature and the constant fight between good and evil within us. They might be mythical, but their lessons feel very real.", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: *The Double-Edged Sword of Corporate Social Responsibility*\n\nAs I've read through the postings on this topic, I've noticed a recurring theme: while many believe corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a vital aspect of modern business, others argue it's merely a marketing ploy. In my opinion, CSR can be a powerful tool for driving positive change, but it's crucial to approach it with a critical perspective.\n\nOn one hand, CSR initiatives can bring numerous benefits, such as improved brand reputation, increased employee engagement, and enhanced stakeholder trust. By prioritizing social and environmental responsibility, companies can contribute to a more sustainable future and make a positive impact on the communities they serve.\n\nHowever, as some commenters have pointed out, CSR can also be used as a form of \"greenwashing\" or \"social washing,\" where companies prioritize image over actual impact. To avoid this pitfall, it's essential for businesses to prioritize transparency, accountability, and genuine commitment to their CSR initiatives.\n\nUltimately, CSR should be about more than just philanthropy or public relations; it should be an integral part of a company's core values and operations. By embracing this approach, businesses can create long-term value for both their stakeholders and society as a whole. Let's strive for a more nuanced understanding of CSR, one that acknowledges both its potential benefits and limitations.", "label": 5}

The seller initially insisted on the price, stating the engine was perfect and the price already competitive. I countered by showing online quotes for new tires and body polishing. I also mentioned similar cars were available on the market at slightly lower prices.\n\nAfter some discussion and an attempt by the seller to offer new floor mats, I proposed a price of €13,500, justifying it with the imminent expenses.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I firmly believe that companies bear a significant responsibility to society, a duty that extends beyond merely maximizing shareholder profits. While financial success is undeniably crucial for a business's survival, it should not be its exclusive focus in the modern world.\n\nBusinesses are not isolated entities; they are deeply interwoven into the fabric of the communities in which they operate. They utilize local resources, employ local people, and benefit from public infrastructure .This inherent interconnectedness creates a moral and practical obligation for companies to contribute positively to the societal ecosystem that enables their existence\n\nIt is true, as some argue, that the primary responsibility of a business, from a purely financial perspective, has traditionally been viewed as increasing profits for its shareholders.Furthermore, some cynical viewpoints suggest that corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives can sometimes serve as little more than public relations tools, offering a positive image without substantial impact.\nHowever, such narrow interpretations fail to account for the evolving expectations of consumers and the demonstrable .A business truly committed to social responsibility finds that these efforts often translate into improved brand value, higher employee morale, and ultimately, sustained financial performance that benefits shareholders in the long run.\n\nIn essence, a company's responsibility should encompass both its shareholders and the broader society. By embracing CSR, businesses not only fulfill an ethical imperative but also secure a more sustainable and prosperous future for themselves and the communities they serve.\n\n", "label": 5}

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Harry,\n\nHere are some ideas for motivating your employees. I also included some things to avoid.\n\nIncentivize your employees. Make them feel that the company's success means success for them as well. There's nothing like a possible reward to motivate people. Consider performance bonuses, recognition programs, or opportunities for career advancement.\n\nTake an active interest in your employees' career paths. Offer them additional training and act as their mentor. Help them set and achieve personal goals that align with the company's objectives. This demonstrates your commitment to their growth and development.\n\nEmphasize a healthy work-life balance. Recognize that employees have lives outside the company. Encourage them to take breaks and use their vacation time to recharge. A well-rested employee is more productive and engaged.\n\nListen to your employees. If people feel like they are being heard, even when they are complaining, they will be happier and more productive. Create an open-door policy and encourage feedback to foster an inclusive environment.\n\nTreat subordinates the way you would like to be treated by your superiors. Respect and appreciation go a long way in building a positive and motivated team.\n\nHere are five ways to demotivate your staff:\n\nDisrespect subordinates because they are below you. This creates a toxic environment and erodes trust.\n\nTake credit or claim responsibility for work done by your subordinates. Always acknowledge the contributions of your team.\n\nLose your temper. Maintain professionalism even in challenging situations.\n\nLet employees unfairly take the blame for things. Foster a culture of accountability and support.\n\nDon't compliment or praise people for good work. Recognition is a powerful motivator, so celebrate successes both big and small.\n\nGood luck with your team!\n\nBest regards,\nSumit", "label": 5}

This decision is based on a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of both companies.\n\nEvaluation of Training Companies\n\nTrainQuick\n\nTrainQuick offers affordable and flexible training options. However, it has not been well-received by employees in our other branch. A significant drawback is that employees are uncomfortable with being mixed with participants from different branches during training sessions. This issue has led to low engagement and utilization rates, making TrainQuick a less viable option for our needs.\n\nSkills Pro\n\nSkills Pro, on the other hand, is more expensive but has demonstrated higher quality and effectiveness. While the course content has been described as challenging, employees who enroll in the courses tend to complete them successfully. Moreover, Skills Pro is planning to expand its course offerings, which could provide additional value and opportunities for our staff's development.\n\nRecommendation\n\nConsidering the higher completion rates and the planned expansion of courses, Skills Pro is the recommended choice. The investment in a more expensive but quality training program will likely yield better results in terms of employee satisfaction and skill acquisition.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, selecting Skills Pro aligns with our commitment to providing high-quality training for our employees.

The rapid advancement of digital tools has created endless possibilities, from enabling remote work to facilitating instant communication across continents. With just a few clicks, we can access vast amounts of information, collaborate with people around the world, and entertain ourselves in numerous ways.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language can be exciting, but it also comes with its fair share of challenges. One of the main obstacles students face is the fear of making mistakes. Often, people feel insecure about pronunciation or grammar and avoid speaking altogether. This is a mistake because practice is key to learning. Another common challenge is the lack of real-world practice. Even if you study every day, without interacting with native speakers or other learners, vocabulary and grammar are easily forgotten over time.\n\nMotivation is also a crucial factor. Language learning requires patience, and it’s easy to get discouraged when progress feels slow. Furthermore, many learners try to memorize everything at once, which can become overwhelming. Focusing solely on perfection can lead to burnout.\n\nHow can these issues be tackled? First, it’s important to accept that making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process. No one gets everything right from the start. Second, seeking opportunities to engage in conversation, even with other learners or online groups, can accelerate progress. Finally, setting small goals, like learning five new words a day, can keep motivation high and create a sense of achievement.", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that‚Äôs popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature that has fascinated people for centuries is the basilisk, a mythical beast from European folklore, especially prominent in Italian legends. Often called the \"king of serpents,\" the basilisk is said to be born from a serpent’s egg incubated by a rooster. This fearsome creature is typically described as a serpent or lizard with a crown-like crest on its head, symbolizing its deadly majesty.\n\nWhat makes the basilisk truly terrifying is its lethal gaze—according to legend, it can kill with a single glance or even by its breath. In some tales, its venom is so potent that it leaves a trail of death in its wake, wilting plants and cracking stones. Despite its power, the basilisk has a fatal weakness: its own reflection. Mirrors were often used by brave heroes to defeat it, turning its deadly gaze back upon itself.\n\nThe basilisk has inspired countless stories, from medieval bestiaries to modern fantasy novels. It embodies the fear of the unknown and the deadly power of nature, making it one of the most enduring and chilling creatures in myth. Would you like an illustration of the basilisk as well?", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: In my opinion, companies do not have the responsibility to contribute to society. The main responsibility of each company is to be profitable and meet the expectations of the shareholders. \n\nAs it is the companies and the shareholders risk if the business is losing money, they should also be the ones rewarded with the profitability. The companies should not be forced to smaller their profits due to the expectations of the society to spend money for CSR. I do believe that it is the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n\nSome people may argue that the companies should help the communities and that it's a two-way street, as the communities are letting them do their businesses. I think that the companies are already helping the communities by creating jobs and therefore increasing the value and the wealth of it. \n\nTo summarize my statement, companies should focus on shareholder profits, not societal contributions. Governments should handle public welfare through regulations. Job creation benefits communities enough, and CSR shouldn’t cut profits, as shareholders bear risks.", "label": 4}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I don't feel very comfortable writing about Socially Responsible Companies (CSR), but I will try to say what I think about each and every company that is established; Companies are always very important, with rare exceptions, as we have in Brazil, some companies that extract gold from the ground, are the so-called illegal mining companies; The soil has many holes and the products used in mining, such as mercury, contaminate the water.  These illegal mining companies do not bring any benefits to the local community and exploit the workers, who are often called slave laborers. \nHowever, there are other companies that are beneficial to the local community, workers and even the cities where these companies are located. For example, we have automobile companies, which are more centralized in the capitals of the Southeast of our country. Automobile companies are also arriving in the northeast of the country with the introduction of electric cars; these companies absorb local labor and allow employees' children to also grow up qualifying themselves, as training companies are also arriving in these cities. Therefore, these are the same companies that we can call true Socially Responsible Companies. Many countries try to encourage these companies to establish themselves in order to improve the lives of people in the city in all aspects. \n\n", "label": 3}

I mean, Josh, that's $54,000 a year!\n\nI'm going to summarize our discussions here. I know that you are strongly in favor of just staying where we are and paying the higher rent. The obvious disadvantages of that are that our sales of clothing are increasing more slowly than our expenses AND with the rapid growth in Centerville, we can expect further rent increases in the coming months. The big pro for staying is that we're in a fashionable district where long-term customers know us. We're right downtown, so customers can come in on their lunch breaks to be measured for a suit or other high-end clothing.\n\nYou know that I favor going to a completely different model. We move to the south end of town for making the clothes, but create a system where we meet people in their offices or schools to measure them for new clothes. We also open up a much better webpage than what we have now so that customers can view our clothing options and enter their measurements. Incredible cost savings! The con of that is that we lose the showroom, where customers can just come in and look at the possibilities, feel the cloth and talk to us about what would be appropriate for them.

Type in the input box. Write 60-100 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: \nPigs on Wheels: The Rise of Swinemobiles\n\nIn a quiet village nestled between green hills and muddy fields, something unusual began happening: pigs were driving cars.\n\nIt all started when Farmer Joe decided his pigs were too smart to stay in the pen. Inspired by their curiosity and knack for mischief, he built a small car powered by vegetable oil and trained his favorite pig, Hamlet, to drive it. To everyone's surprise, Hamlet took to the road like a pro — snorting happily as he zipped down the dirt paths.\n\nSoon, the other pigs got jealous. Joe built more cars, each customized for piggy needs: extra-wide seats, snack dispensers filled with apples, and built-in mud sprayers for cooling off on hot days. The local media dubbed them “Swinemobiles.”\n\nThe pig-driven cars became a sensation. Crowds gathered to watch the pigs cruise around town, honking their tiny horns and obeying traffic signals better than most humans. One particularly bold pig, Penelope, even started giving rides to kids.\n\nOf course, there were challenges. Some pigs refused to wear seat belts. Others got distracted by cornfields. But overall, the Swinemobile project was a success — proving once and for all that when pigs fly, they might just do it on four wheels.", "label": 5}

Its presence is chilling, and it's often associated with icy winds and an overwhelming feeling of dread. The Wendigo serves as a warning about the dangers of selfishness and losing one's humanity.

It's a crucial part of effective management.\n\nTo keep your team engaged, definitely incentivize your employees. When they see their efforts directly linked to company success and potential rewards, it's a powerful motivator. Also, take an active interest in their career paths. Offering training and acting as a mentor shows you're invested in their growth, which builds loyalty and drive. Remember to emphasize a healthy work-life balance; respecting their personal lives leads to more committed and less burnt-out team members. Finally, always listen to your employees and treat them with the respect you'd expect from your own superiors. Feeling heard and valued makes a huge difference.\n\nOn the flip side, avoid actions that can quickly demotivate. Never disrespect subordinates or take credit for their work. Losing your temper or allowing them to unfairly take the blame will erode trust instantly. And please, always compliment and praise good work; a lack of recognition can be incredibly disheartening.\n\nGood luck with your new role!\n\nBest,\nMax", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that‚Äôs popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most fascinating legendary creatures in India is the Nag—a mystical serpent found in Hindu mythology. These divine beings are often depicted as half-human, half-snake entities, possessing great wisdom and supernatural abilities. Nagas are believed to reside in underground realms or sacred waters, guarding treasures and ancient secrets. They are both revered and feared, symbolizing fertility, protection, and transformation.\n\nIn Hindu epics like the Mahabharata, famous Nagas such as Vasuki and Ananta appear alongside powerful deities. Vasuki, the king of serpents, played a vital role in the churning of the ocean to obtain amrita, the nectar of immortality. Ananta, a thousand-headed serpent, is said to be the eternal resting couch of Lord Vishnu, signifying infinity and cosmic balance.\n\nDespite their revered status, Nagas can also be vengeful if disrespected. Legends warn against harming snakes, as they might retaliate with misfortune. Even today, many temples across India are dedicated to Nagas, and festivals like Nag Panchami celebrate their spiritual significance.\nTheir presence in mythology, folklore, and religious traditions makes them one of the most intriguing legendary creatures in Indian culture.\n", "label": 5}

A lot has happened in my life since then.\n\nAbout five years ago, Stella and I moved with our son Jeremy to Oxford, New Zealand, and lived out in the country. I did contract design work. You know that's what I've always loved. Stella taught math in a local university. Jeremy went to school and made a lot of friends. Eventually, though, we ended up back in St. Louis, where we've been living for the past year.\n\nI'm working for a design firm, and Stella has been teaching in a university. We bought a little two-bedroom house in the suburbs, and we're basically happy, but sometimes we feel that something's missing. The suburbs are crowded, and the houses all look the same. Jeremy left for college, so we're lonely, old empty nesters looking for a change. We're actually thinking about adopting a child. At our age, are we crazy?\n\nAnyway, let's reconnect.

The restaurant focused on organic produce to ensure quality. I enjoyed the flavors of the herbs and spices in the meal. After finishing the main course, I decided to try the dessert.

There weren’t parties like we know today, but cakes were prepared and offers were made. Then, the habits of wishing happy birthday, giving gifts and lighting candles became popular as a way to protect the birthday person from devils and ensure good things to the next year in the person’s life. The celebrations only became popular like we know today after fourteen centuries, in a collective festival performed in Germany\n\nDepartment Stores\nThe first department store was created in Paris, in 1850. It was conceived as a big place with a lot of options in products and brands. They wouldn’t sell just a specific product: there you could  find clothes, shoes, jewels, make up and many others things. That concept remained until today. So, if you want to buy many things with good prices, you can choose from one of the thousands in the world.\n\nEvery year, on the day after Thanksgiving, most of this stores have a big sale called Black Friday.

Offer them additional training if needed and act as their mentor.\nEmphasize a healthy work-life balance. Recognize that employees have lives outside the company.\nListen to your employees.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: In my opinion, companies do have a responsibility to society, not just to their shareholders. While making a profit is essential for any business, this goal should not come at the expense of people, communities, or the environment. Corporations operate within a social and ecological context—they benefit from public infrastructure, legal systems, and educated workforces, all of which are supported by society. It’s only fair that they give something back.\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) should not be seen as a burden or a PR strategy, but as an opportunity to align business goals with the well-being of society. When companies treat employees well, support local communities, and invest in sustainable practices, they create long-term value—not just for shareholders, but for everyone involved.\n\nI agree with the argument that consumers care about how companies behave. A strong CSR approach builds trust and loyalty. In contrast, companies that ignore social responsibilities may face backlash, lose customers, or struggle with employee retention.\n\nThat said, CSR should be authentic and integrated into core business strategies, not just surface-level gestures. And while the government plays a crucial role in setting regulations, businesses can and should go beyond minimum requirements to become true agents of positive change.\n\nIn short, businesses thrive when societies thrive—and that makes CSR a shared responsibility, not a luxury.", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility: A Business Imperative\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is not just an ethical obligation—it is a strategic necessity. In today's interconnected world, companies have a profound impact on society, and their role extends beyond generating profits for shareholders. Businesses thrive in communities that support them, and in return, they should contribute to the well-being of those communities.\nCSR benefits companies in multiple ways. Ethical business practices and sustainability initiatives enhance brand reputation, build consumer trust, and foster long-term customer loyalty. Companies that prioritize social responsibility often outperform competitors, as consumers increasingly favor brands that align with their values. Moreover, investing in employee welfare improves productivity and reduces turnover, creating a more stable and motivated workforce.\nWhile some argue that a corporation's sole responsibility is to maximize shareholder value, this perspective is outdated. Long-term profitability and societal well-being are intertwined—neglecting CSR can lead to reputational damage, regulatory challenges, and lost market share. Instead of viewing social responsibility as a burden, companies should recognize it as an opportunity to drive innovation, establish meaningful partnerships, and create lasting positive change.\nUltimately, CSR is not a distraction from business success; it is a fundamental part of it. Companies must embrace their role as global citizens, ensuring that their operations contribute positively to society while maintaining sustainable profitability.\nWould you like me to refine this or add specific examples to strengthen the argument?\n", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: In today's interconnected world, the role of businesses extends far beyond generating profits for shareholders. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is not just a buzzword; it is a fundamental aspect of modern business practices that can lead to sustainable growth and a positive societal impact.\n\nSupporting CSR:\n\nCompanies have a significant impact on the communities in which they operate. By engaging in CSR activities, businesses can contribute to the well-being of these communities. For instance, investing in local education, healthcare, and infrastructure can lead to a more educated and healthier workforce, which in turn benefits the company through increased productivity and loyalty.\n\nMoreover, CSR initiatives can enhance a company's reputation. Consumers today are more socially conscious and prefer to support businesses that align with their values. By demonstrating a commitment to social and environmental causes, companies can build stronger relationships with their customers, leading to increased brand loyalty and long-term success.\n\nOpposing View:\n\nOn the other hand, some argue that a company's primary responsibility is to its shareholders. They believe that resources spent on CSR could be better utilized to maximize profits and shareholder value. However, this perspective overlooks the long-term benefits of CSR. A company that neglects its social responsibilities may face backlash from consumers, leading to a damaged reputation and potential financial losses.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, while the primary goal of any business is to generate profits, this should not come at the expense of societal well-being. CSR is an investment in the future, fostering a positive relationship between businesses and the communities they serve. By embracing CSR, companies can achieve sustainable growth, enhance their reputation, and contribute to a better world.", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 6-Elementary [SEP] Prompt: Your colleague is proposing a new location for your office. Read his email, then write the executive summary telling which one he recommends, Office One or Office Bravo. Type in the input box. Write 50-75 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Executive Summary – Office Location Recommendation\n\nAfter reviewing the email sent by my colleague regarding the potential relocation of our office, the recommendation is clearly in favor of Office Bravo as the better option compared to Office One. Below is a detailed summary of the reasoning and justification provided for this recommendation.\n\nLocation and Accessibility\nOffice Bravo is located in a more central area of the city, offering better accessibility for both employees and clients. According to the evaluation, it is closer to public transportation hubs, which would make commuting easier and more cost-effective for the team. In contrast, Office One is situated in a more remote area, requiring a longer commute time for most employees. This could lead to delays, increased transportation costs, and even reduced employee satisfaction over time. Office Bravo, therefore, presents itself as a more strategic location for the company's day-to-day operations.\n\nCost and Value\nWhile Office One initially appears more affordable in terms of monthly rent, Office Bravo offers greater value for the price. Office Bravo includes several amenities such as conference rooms, high-speed internet, reception service, and maintenance, which are not part of the Office One package. These additional features contribute to a more efficient and professional work environment and could save the company money in the long run by avoiding extra service costs. The total cost-benefit analysis leans in favor of Office Bravo due to its inclusive service package and better infrastructure.\n\nWork Environment and Amenities\nOffice Bravo is designed to promote productivity and well-being. It includes large windows for natural lighting, ergonomic furniture, a shared kitchen, rest areas, and even a fitness room for employees. These amenities are important for employee morale and can have a positive impact on retention and performance. Office One, while functional, lacks many of these features and is described as more outdated in design, with limited natural light and fewer shared spaces. The overall atmosphere in Office Bravo is more aligned with modern office trends and supports a healthier and more collaborative work culture.\n\nClient Impressions\nThe image a company presents to its clients is also crucial. Office Bravo is located in a prestigious business district and has a more polished, professional appearance. Hosting meetings in such a space would leave a stronger impression on potential clients and partners, potentially influencing business negotiations and partnerships. Office One, on the other hand, is in a less attractive location and may not convey the same level of professionalism. For a company looking to grow and expand its client base, choosing Office Bravo would help elevate its external perception.\n\nScalability and Future Growth\nAnother important factor highlighted in the email was scalability. Office Bravo offers more flexibility in terms of expansion, with available spaces that could be easily adapted if the team grows in the near future. This is a major advantage, as it allows the company to plan for long-term growth without having to relocate again. Office One, by contrast, is limited in space, and any future growth would likely require another move, which can be costly and disruptive.\n\nFinal Recommendation\nTaking all of the above factors into consideration — location, accessibility, amenities, overall value, employee experience, and future scalability — the recommendation is to move forward with Office Bravo. Although the upfront cost may be slightly higher, the long-term benefits in terms of employee satisfaction, client perception, and operational efficiency far outweigh the initial savings offered by Office One.In conclusion, Office Bravo aligns better with the company’s goals of professional growth, operational excellence, and employee well-being. Choosing this location represents a strategic investment in the company's future and positions it more competitively in the market.", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that‚Äôs popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most captivating legendary creatures in Brazilian folklore is the Curupira. This elusive being is often depicted as a small, agile indigenous boy with fiery red hair and, most notably, backward-facing feet. This unique characteristic serves as a clever defense mechanism, as the Curupira leaves misleading footprints, confusing hunters and loggers who attempt to track him through the dense Amazon rainforest. \nThe Curupira is known as the fierce guardian of the forests and its inhabitants. He uses his cunning and knowledge of the wilderness to protect the trees, plants, and animals from human exploitation and destruction. His methods can be mischievous, ranging from creating illusions and strange sounds to leading intruders astray, ensuring they get lost deep within the jungle. Tales of the Curupira serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of respecting nature and its delicate balance, embodying the spirit of environmental protection within Brazilian culture.

Then write other sentences to support the topic sentence examples. Think about questions like: **How often does he/she exercise? What does he/she eat?** Type in the input box. Write 25-50 words. [SEP] Response: English has become one of the most influential languages in the world today, playing a central role in multiple aspects of global life. As the primary language of international communication, it facilitates business, education, science, technology, and even popular culture. Mastering English is no longer just a valuable skill, but a necessity for those wishing to succeed in an interconnected and globalized world.\na\nOne of the main reasons why English is so important is its dominance in the business world. Global companies and multinational corporations use English as their common language for communication and transactions. In many industries, fluency in English is a requirement for career advancement, as it opens the door to job opportunities that span across countries and continents. Professionals who can speak English are often more competitive in the job market, as they can interact with international clients, colleagues, and partners.\n\nIn addition to business, English is vital in the field of technology. Most programming languages, digital platforms, and software are developed in English. A large portion of online content is also in English, meaning that non-English speakers may miss out on vital information and technological advancements. By learning English, individuals gain access to a vast array of resources, tutorials, and innovative solutions, which can be crucial for personal and professional growth.\n\nThe importance of English also extends to education. Many of the world’s top universities and research institutions conduct their programs in English. Scholars and students often publish papers and articles in English, making it the primary language of academic exchange. Those who are proficient in English have direct access to the latest research and can contribute to the global academic conversation. Moreover, many international scholarships and study abroad opportunities require knowledge of the English language.\n\nIn the cultural realm, English also holds significant value. Hollywood movies, popular music, books, and online content are often produced in English. Knowing the language allows individuals to engage with a wider range of cultural products, without relying on translations or subtitles. This cultural exchange is essential in building a more inclusive and understanding world, as it helps break down language barriers between different nations and regions.\n\nEnglish is also the dominant language on the internet. From social media platforms to news outlets, most online communication takes place in English. This allows people to connect with others across the globe, participate in global discussions, and stay informed about world events. For anyone involved in digital marketing or online entrepreneurship, English is the primary tool for reaching a broader audience and promoting products or services internationally.\n\nMoreover, English is often used as a bridge language in international diplomacy. Countries around the world use it to negotiate, discuss global issues, and collaborate on solutions to common challenges. Having a solid understanding of English allows individuals to participate in global debates, whether on climate change, human rights, or economic policies, ensuring that their voices are heard on the world stage.\n\nIn summary, learning English is a key to unlocking countless opportunities in various fields, whether in business, education, culture, or technology. In a world where global connections are more important than ever, English serves as the common ground for people from different backgrounds to communicate, collaborate, and thrive together. For those seeking to improve their prospects in life, mastering English is an essential step toward success in an increasingly interconnected world.\n\n", "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: From: Stan\nTo: All\n\nHey!\n\nI got your email address from our old friend Valerie. I can't believe we've only seen each other once in the last 20 years! So much has happened since then.\n\nAbout five years ago, Stella and I moved with our son Jeremy to Oxford, New Zealand, and lived out in the country. I did contract design work—still my passion—and Stella taught math at a local university. Jeremy went to school there and made lots of friends. Eventually, though, we made our way back to St. Louis, where we've been living for the past year.\n\nThese days, I’m working for a design firm, and Stella is teaching at a university again. We bought a small two-bedroom house in the suburbs. We're basically happy, but sometimes we feel like something’s missing. The suburbs are a bit crowded, and all the houses look the same. With Jeremy off to college, it’s just the two of us now—lonely, old empty nesters thinking about making a change. We're even considering adopting a child. At our age, are we crazy?\n\nAnyway, let’s reconnect. Your kids must be all grown up now—how are they doing?

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature that has fascinated generations in Angola is Kibua, a mythical forest spirit from central Angolan folklore. Kibua is often described as a tall, shadowy being with glowing eyes and the ability to vanish into trees. According to local legend, Kibua protects the sacred forests and only appears to those who disrespect nature or break taboos in the wild.\n\nKibua is said to emit strange, echoing sounds at night, confusing hunters and travelers. Many elders tell stories of people who vanished in the woods after ignoring warnings, believed to have been taken by Kibua to teach a lesson. Despite the fear surrounding this creature, Kibua is not entirely evil — in fact, it rewards those who show respect to the land with safe passage and even protection from wild animals.\n\nThis creature reflects traditional Angolan values about the environment, community respect, and ancestral presence. Though rarely spoken of in urban areas today, Kibua remains an important figure in rural storytelling, passed down to children as a guardian of both fear and wisdom.", "label": 5}

Furthermore, they plan to expand the course what is a good point. \n\nBy contrast, looking at the data, in one hand TrainQuick is cheaper and flexible, but in the other hand, people are not using it in the other branch.

[SEP] Response: \nThe Importance of Daily Exercise\n\nDaily exercise plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental health. Just 30 minutes of moderate activity each day can improve cardiovascular fitness, boost mood, and increase energy levels. Regular physical activity also helps control weight, strengthens muscles and bones, and reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.\n\nExercise doesn't have to be intense or time-consuming. Walking, cycling, swimming, or even dancing are great ways to stay active. Consistency is more important than intensity, especially for beginners. Additionally, exercising outdoors can enhance the experience, offering fresh air and a change of scenery.\n\nBeyond physical benefits, exercise is known to reduce stress, improve sleep quality, and boost self-esteem. It also promotes the release of endorphins, chemicals in the brain that act as natural painkillers and mood elevators. In short, making exercise a daily habit is a powerful step toward a healthier and happier life.\n\n", "label": 0}

While it’s not by the coast, it’s famous for the tranquility of its river and the vast open fields. The landscape around is made up of gentle hills and dense forests, with a rich variety of wildflowers that make the town even more charming. In Willow Creek, people enjoy the simplicity of daily life, many living in country houses and growing their own food.\n\nOn weekends, people often gather in the town center, which has a small square with wooden benches under leafy trees. It’s a very peaceful place to chat or just watch the town go by. The climate is mild year-round, with warm summers and cool winters, making it a pleasant place in any season.\n\nThe town is surrounded by walking and biking trails that attract both locals and tourists seeking to connect with nature. The river running through the town is ideal for fishing or peaceful boat rides.\n\nAlthough it’s a small town, Willow Creek has a strong sense of community, and the residents know each other well. There’s a local market on Saturdays where regional farmers sell fresh fruits, vegetables, and other goods. The town also has a small school and a library, which have become hubs for socializing and culture.\n\nDuring festivals and events, the community gathers at the sports field for outdoor activities like fairs and birthday parties. In the fall, the harvest festival is particularly popular, where everyone celebrates with traditional food, music, and dances.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: CSR - corporate social responsibility. An argumentation about if companies have a responsibility to society or if their only responsibility is to its shareholders. In my opinon companies need to fulfill their social responibility. \n\nI strongly agree with lil@213 - companies have a big impact on society and as they are are allowed to run their business somewhere, they sould also help the communities there.  I like the picture of the two-way-street a lot, beacause on the one hand companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy and on the other hand the company performs well and as a result communities around the world benefit.\n\nWhile ritics, like Milton Friedman, believe that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits we also need to take into consideration that, as an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n\nAnd although you might say that these - on first sight - huge sums of money spent by companies on development porjects  are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings, it's also evident that sustainable operations and fair employee benefits ensures high productivity and less turnover.\n\nTo summarize: CSR is a win-win for both - companies and the community.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility is a must and self-regulating business model that encourages companies to be socially accountable to themselves, their stakeholders, and the public. It involves initiatives that contribute positively to society and the environment, going beyond mere compliance with legal requirements. Every company should motivate their employee to move towards CSR for an positive mindset. Government should also take right steps to motivate CSR activities in companies, businesses and individuals for a better future. There should also be a board which should monitor all the CSR activities and the board should take care of the liability and the transparency of these activities. Anyone involved in the CSR, should be kind and mindful of the acts which are being showcased. Within the firms as well, they have to be cautious of any manipulations to rebrand their status. A proper regulatory body along with a few guidelines should be established for smooth functioning of the CSR activities. Rather it be a 5 million dollar donation or spending 5 hours of time with the disadvantageous people, it should be considered as same and should be recognised equally without any biasness'.

Sometimes, they don’t realize the impact of their approach.\n\nAs for Tia, relationships are tricky, and I can imagine it’s hard when things aren’t going as you hoped. If you’re feeling like it might be the end, it’s okay to give yourself the space to grieve that. Relationships change, and sometimes we just have to acknowledge that things aren’t aligned anymore. But also, don’t be too hard on yourself — these situations are tough, and you're doing the best you can.\n\nTake care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need to talk more.\n\nTake it one step at a time.\n[Maria]\n", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: From_\nToAll\nJosh,\n\nWe really have to make a decision about our business. Our landlord just wrote me another letter about the rent. Next month, it will be raised 25% to $4,500 per month. That's going to eat even more into our profits. I mean, Josh, that's $54,000 a year!\n\nI'm going to summarize our discussions here. I know that you are strongly in favor of just staying where we are and paying the higher rent. The obvious disadvantages of that are that our sales of clothing are increasing more slowly than our expenses AND with the rapid growth in Centerville, we can expect further rent increases in the coming months. The big pro for staying is that we're in a fashionable district where long-term customers know us. We're right downtown, so customers can come in on their lunch breaks to be measured for a suit or other high-end clothing.\n\nYou know that I favor going to a completely different model. We move to the south end of town for making the clothes, but create a system where we meet people in their offices or schools to measure them for new clothes. We also open up a much better webpage than what we have now so that customers can view our clothing options and enter their measurements. Incredible cost savings! The con of that is that we lose the showroom, where customers can just come in and look at the possibilities, feel the cloth and talk to us about what would be appropriate for them. Far less personalized service, which has helped us build close relationships with our customers.\n\nHonestly, I'd like another option, but I'm out of ideas. Should we talk to more people?

With technology constantly demanding our attention, many people struggle to find time for rest, exercise, and meaningful human interaction. It's easy to get caught up in work deadlines, social media, or binge-watching TV shows, while neglecting the physical and mental needs of our bodies and minds. However, creating a sustainable routine that includes proper sleep, healthy eating, and regular physical activity can significantly improve overall well-being. Mental health is equally vital—practices like meditation, journaling, and simply taking time offline can help reduce stress and anxiety. Connecting with others in real life, whether through family gatherings or shared hobbies, can also provide a sense of belonging and emotional support. Ultimately, a balanced lifestyle isn't about perfection but about consistently making choices that support a healthy, fulfilling life. Even small changes can lead to meaningful improvements over time.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a complex but essential concept that addresses the role businesses play in the broader social, economic, and environmental contexts. Companies, as powerful entities, have a significant impact on society, not only through the products and services they offer but also through their operations, hiring practices, and community engagement. While some argue that the sole responsibility of a company is to maximize profits for shareholders, this perspective neglects the long-term benefits of CSR. Companies that invest in sustainable practices, fair labor, and community well-being are more likely to gain consumer loyalty, employee satisfaction, and positive public perception, which, in turn, can boost profitability.\n\nFurthermore, businesses should view CSR not as a mere marketing tool but as a genuine opportunity to contribute to the greater good. This is particularly true in an era where consumers are increasingly concerned with ethical practices. By addressing environmental concerns and improving local communities, companies help create a more stable and sustainable marketplace. While it is true that governments should set the regulations that guide corporate behavior, companies are still active participants in shaping societal standards.\n\nUltimately, companies do have a responsibility to society—not only because it makes good business sense, but because they are integral to the well-being of the communities they serve. A focus on CSR leads to a symbiotic relationship where both business and society thrive.\n", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 14-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Your boss has asked you to write a formal report recommending a training company. You've chosen Skills Pro. Use your notes to write up the report. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: fter evaluating two potential training providers, TrainQuick and Skills Pro, we identified key differences that inform our recommendation.\n\nTrainQuick stands out for being both inexpensive and flexible. However, its implementation has faced challenges. Employees at our other branch have shown low engagement with the program, and there's consistent negative feedback about mixing staff from different branches in the same training sessions. This social discomfort has likely contributed to the low participation rates, reducing the program’s overall effectiveness.\n\nIn contrast, Skills Pro is a more expensive option, and the course content is considered demanding. Despite this, those who enroll tend to complete the program successfully. This suggests that while the material may be rigorous, it is well-structured and supports learners through to completion. Additionally, Skills Pro is planning to expand their course offerings, which could bring further value in the future.\n\nGiven these factors, we recommend choosing Skills Pro. Although it comes at a higher cost, the stronger engagement, better completion rates, and future growth potential justify the investment. Quality training is essential to long-term performance, and Skills Pro aligns more closely with our goals.\n\n", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that‚Äôs popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most fascinating legendary creatures from Indian mythology is the Makara, a hybrid aquatic beast known as the vahana (mount) of the river goddess Ganga and the sea god Varuna. The Makara is depicted with a blend of features from various animals—often shown with the body of a fish or crocodile, the trunk of an elephant, the tail of a peacock, and sometimes even the tusks of a wild boar. This unique combination makes it a formidable yet sacred creature associated with water, strength, and protection.\nIn Hindu and Buddhist iconography, Makara often guards temple entrances, symbolizing its role as a protector against evil forces. It is also believed to be a carrier of energy, transitioning between the physical and spiritual worlds. The Makara's presence in carvings and ancient texts highlights its importance across different traditions. Some interpretations suggest that it embodies the unpredictability and depth of water—a force that can be nurturing but also powerful and untamable.\nWith its fusion of features and deep spiritual significance, the Makara remains one of India’s most intriguing mythological beings, inspiring awe and reverence even today.\n", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most traditional urban legends in Brazil is the legend of Saci-pererê, which is considered one of the most emblematic of Brazilian folklore.\nSaci-pererê, or simply saci, is a black boy who smokes a pipe and wears a red cap that grants him magical powers. One of the characteristics of this character is that he has only one leg.\nThe origin of the legend of Saci-pererê has existed since the end of colonial times and comes from the indigenous tribes of the south of Brazil.\nThe legend is told in all Brazilian regions and, therefore, the story changes according to the location. In some places, it has different names such as: Saci-Cererê, Matimpererê, Matita Perê, Saci-Saçurá, and Saci-Trique.\nIt is said that Saci was born from the bamboo shoot, remaining there until he was seven years old, and after that period he lives another seventy-seven practicing his antics between humans and animals.\nHe enjoy playing tricks on animals and people. According to the stories, his main pranks include braiding the tails of animals at night, hiding objects (like the thimbles of seamstresses), whistling very loudly to scare travelers, swapping salt containers for sugar ones, and distracting cooks so they burn the food.\nThe Saci is the guardian of herbs and medicinal plants, which is why he confuses people who try to take them without permission. He knows the preparation techniques and how to use the plants for medicinal purposes.\nThe legend states that to capture the Saci-pererê, one must throw a sieve into the whirlwinds of wind. This way, after capturing him, it is necessary to remove his hat to keep him in a bottle.\nFinally, upon dying, the Saci becomes a poisonous mushroom.\n\n", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: A recent negotiation involved securing a new contract with a supplier. The preliminary offer included a 5% price increase and a longer lead time. During negotiations, the company highlighted its long-standing relationship and volume commitments, proposing a smaller price increase coupled with a penalty clause for missed delivery dates. The supplier, in turn, discussed their rising material costs and production challenges. Ultimately, a final agreement was reached where the price increase was reduced to 2.5%, and a tiered penalty system was implemented for late deliveries, with a bonus structure for early deliveries. This balanced the supplier's need for cost recovery with the company's desire for predictable delivery times and cost stability. ", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Challenges in Language Learning\n\nLearning a new language can be both exciting and difficult. Many students face common challenges that make the process frustrating at times. One of the biggest issues is fear of making mistakes. Learners often feel embarrassed when they speak incorrectly, which can prevent them from practicing out loud. Without practice, it becomes harder to improve speaking and listening skills.\n\nAnother challenge is vocabulary retention. Even after studying new words, many students forget them quickly. This happens especially when they don’t use the words regularly in real-life situations. What can learners do to remember more? Repetition, flashcards, and conversation practice are useful strategies.\n\nGrammar is also a big hurdle. Every language has its own rules, and some of them can be very different from a student’s native language. This can lead to confusion and slow progress.\n\nFinally, motivation can decrease over time. Language learning takes patience and consistent effort. When students don’t see fast results, they may feel discouraged.\n\nSo how can learners stay motivated? Setting small goals, celebrating progress, and using the language in fun ways—like watching movies or talking to native speakers—can help keep the experience enjoyable.\n\n", "label": 5}

A lot has happened in my life since then.\n\nAbout five years ago, Stella and I moved with our son Jeremy to Oxford, New Zealand, and lived out in the country. I did contract design work. You know that's what I've always loved. Stella taught math in a local university. Jeremy went to school and made a lot of friends. Eventually, though, we ended up back in St. Louis, where we've been living for the past year.\n\nI'm working for a design firm, and Stella has been teaching in a university. We bought a little two-bedroom house in the suburbs, and we're basically happy, but sometimes we feel that something's missing. The suburbs are crowded, and the houses all look the same. Jeremy left for college, so we're lonely, old empty nesters looking for a change. We're actually thinking about adopting a child. At our age, are we crazy?\n\nAnyway, let's reconnect. Your kids must be all grown up now. How are they doing? Please send photos!\n\nCheers\n!\n\nStan", "label": 5}

If leaving isn’t an immediate option, maybe setting small personal goals and focusing on what you can control would help. Looking into opportunities elsewhere might also give you some peace of mind, knowing that you have options.\n\nAs for your relationship with Tia, breakups—or even the possibility of one—are always tough, especially when things seemed promising. It’s natural to feel down about it, but try to focus on the lessons you’ve learned and the good moments you shared. If it does end, give yourself time to heal and process. Lean on friends or activities that bring you comfort, and remember that this is just one chapter in your life—it won’t define your future relationships.\nYou’re not alone, Leon.

Motivated employees are the backbone of a successful organization.\nStart by incentivizing achievements—bonuses, recognition, or opportunities for growth can go a long way. When employees feel their contributions lead to tangible rewards, their motivation rises naturally.\nBe genuinely invested in their professional development. Offer training programs, learning resources, and mentorship. Employees who see a clear path for advancement are more likely to stay engaged and loyal.\nPromote a healthy work-life balance. When team members are well-rested and emotionally supported, their productivity and creativity flourish.\nMake listening a habit. Open communication builds trust, and employees are more motivated when they know their voices matter.\nFinally, lead by example. Respect, humility, and fairness set the tone for the team culture.\nAvoid these pitfalls: disrespecting staff, taking credit for their work, losing your cool, scapegoating, and neglecting praise. These quickly erode trust and morale.\nWishing you the best,\nEF Student\n", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: The Big Online Debate\nDo you believe companies have a responsibility to society? Or do you think a company's only responsibility is to its shareholders? We invite you to join this discussion by posting your opinion on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nFor CSR\n\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925\n\nWrite \n", "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: **Improving My Studying Skills: Lessons Learned**  \n\nStudying effectively is not just about spending hours with books—it’s about smart strategies, discipline, and self-awareness. Over time, I’ve discovered what helps me learn more efficiently, what hinders progress, and what surprises me along the way.  \n\nOne essential improvement was structuring my study sessions. Instead of cramming, I adopted **spaced repetition**, which allowed me to retain information longer. Creating summaries in my own words helped solidify concepts, while practicing active recall—testing myself without looking at notes—sharpened my memory.  \n\nOn the other hand, procrastination and multitasking proved to be major pitfalls. I initially thought I could study while listening to music or checking my phone. However, distractions slowed me down and made learning less effective. I also learned that passive reading without engagement led to forgetfulness. Highlighting everything in a textbook didn’t mean I understood it!  \n\nSurprisingly, some difficult subjects became manageable once I broke them into smaller parts. Complex formulas in math, for example, made more sense when I grasped the underlying principles first. However, I underestimated the challenge of writing well-structured essays—forming coherent arguments required more practice than expected.  \n\nUltimately, studying smarter means understanding oneself. By refining methods, avoiding distractions, and staying persistent, I continue to enhance my learning experience.  \n", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Hi Leon,\n\nI'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. It sounds like both work and your relationship with Tia are causing you a lot of stress.\n\nRegarding work, it might help to have a candid conversation with your manager about how you're feeling. Sometimes, management isn't aware of the impact their actions (or lack thereof) have on their team. If that doesn't help, consider looking for opportunities elsewhere where your efforts are recognized and valued.\n\nAs for your relationship with Tia, it's natural to feel down when things aren't going well. Relationships can be challenging, and it's important to communicate openly with her about your feelings and concerns. If you both decide to end things, remember that it's okay to take time to heal and focus on yourself.\n\nDon't hesitate to reach out whenever you need to talk. I'm here for you.\n\n", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language is a rewarding but often difficult journey. One of the biggest challenges is misunderstanding instructions, especially when the language is still new. For example, while in class, the teacher might give directions that sound clear to native speakers, but when you're learning, it's easy to misinterpret. I always try to explain it back in my own words to check if I had correctly understood.\n\nAnother big issue is confidence. Many learners are often afraid of making mistakes, so they just avoid speaking. Probably a good approach for this is for the teacher to ask open questions like \"What do you think this word means?\" in order to make the learner think and speak. Closed questions don't really push us to learn.\n\nFinally, I believe that is easier to stay motivated when teachers really involve the students in their lessons: checking understanding, encouraging participation and probably making some jokes around the subject!\n\nIn short, I feel that effective communication strategies make a huge difference when learning a language.", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: I believe that the creative writing techniques introduced here could be useful for many types of writing. In my line of work, the 'questioning' technique comes in handy. I use it so often and so instinctively that I have to admit that I no longer think of it as a technique. You see, I write technology articles for a weekly banking magazine and use a common journalistic approach: answering the five 'wh-' questions as you write the first paragraph of the story. That way, you anticipate the most salient questions your readers might have about the story.\n\nA technique I'd like to formally experiment with is loop writing. Sometimes, when I'm trying to formulate the first, critical paragraph for my story, it's difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. I don't always know what the most relevant information is until I sort through all of the details. Loop writing would allow me to think through all of the details, summarize them, rethink them and summarize them again. I believe that final summary could give me a jump-start on a powerful lead paragraph.", "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: Training Partner Selection Report: Choice of SKILLSPro\n\nAfter careful evaluation of both training providers—TrainQuick and SKILLSPro—we recommend proceeding with SKILLSPro as our preferred training partner.\n\nWhile TrainQuick offers a cost-effective and flexible solution, our internal feedback indicates that it has not been adopted effectively in other branches. A key concern is the negative response from employees about being grouped with participants from different branches.

The course content is rigorous, and while initially perceived as challenging, it has a strong record of participant completion. This speaks to the program's structure, support mechanisms, and effectiveness. Furthermore, SKILLSPro is planning to expand its course offerings, which aligns well with our long-term goals of continuous upskilling and professional development.\n\nIn summary, although SKILLSPro demands a higher investment, it offers a superior learning experience, higher engagement, and better outcomes.

Make them feel that the company's success means success for them as well. There's nothing like a possible reward to motivate people.\n- Take an active interest in your employees' career paths. Offer them additional training and act as their mentor. You could have a quarterly appraisal interview to discuss performance and development.\n- Emphasize a healthy work-life balance. Recognize that employees have lives outside the company.\n- Listen to your employees. If people feel like they are being heard, even when they are complaining, they will be happier and more productive.\n- How to show respect to your team? Treat subordinates the way you would like to be treated by your superiors.\n\nDemotivating your employees:\n- How can people become disengaged? Disrespect subordinates because they are below you. Always treat them equally.\n- Take credit or claim responsibility for work done by your subordinates.\n- Lose your temper. Don't get angry or start shouting.\n- Let employees unfairly take the blame for things.\n- Don't compliment or praise people for good work.\n\nI hope this helps.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature that’s captivated imaginations for centuries is the Kitsune, a mythical fox spirit from Japanese folklore. Far from being your average woodland critter, the Kitsune is often portrayed as an intelligent, magical being with the ability to shape-shift—most commonly into a beautiful woman. With each passing century, it’s said a Kitsune grows another tail, up to nine, each symbolizing greater power and wisdom.\nKitsune are known to walk the delicate line between mischief and benevolence. Some serve as loyal protectors and messengers of Inari, the Shinto deity of rice and prosperity. Others, however, enjoy tricking foolish humans, weaving illusions and bending reality to their whims. What makes the Kitsune especially fascinating is its duality—it embodies both the sacred and the wild, the guardian and the trickster.\nBeyond folklore, the Kitsune has seeped into modern culture, appearing in anime, literature, and video games. It remains a symbol of enchantment, mystery, and the ever-blurring line between the human and the supernatural. That blend of elegance and unpredictability? Kind of irresistible.\n", "label": 5}

In hospitals, robots assist in surgeries, deliver medications, and even help with patient care, reducing the burden on healthcare workers. In some cities, robots are being used in restaurants and hotels to take orders or deliver items to guests. I feel that the use of robots is both exciting and concerning. On the positive side, they increase efficiency, reduce risks in dangerous jobs, and can help improve the quality of services. However, the negative side includes potential job losses for workers in industries where robots replace human labor. There is also the risk of people becoming too dependent on machines, leading to reduced human interaction and skills. In the future, robots will likely bring many benefits to society, especially in terms of safety and innovation, but it is important to manage their integration carefully to ensure that everyone can benefit from the changes they bring.", "label": 0}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I truly believe that companies have a responsibility to society, since a country's development depends largely on the private sector. Ultimately, social responsibility has a positive impact on the company itself, its employees, and the communities it serves. A company that only thinks about the benefits of its shareholders is a company that doesn't contribute to social and economic development. At the end of the day, we all want to feel satisfied with what we do; contributing to sustainable development and the well-being of society is a good way to achieve this. Certainly, putting social responsibility into practice is a great challenge, as it involves acting ethically and considering the impact of our actions on the social environment. However, the rewards are significant: reducing poverty, reducing inequalities, and improving people's quality of life. And why not? We also strengthen our reputation and competitiveness. As global evidence shows, companies that are socially responsible have a better reputation among citizens and are more competitive, attracting greater investment. In short, the importance of corporate social responsibility lies in the fact that it promotes the socioeconomic development of communities, contributing to the reduction of poverty and inequality while contributing to the long-term sustainability of companies and improving their reputation and relationships with stakeholders.\nLet's use evidence to improve and build a better country from the private sector!\n", "label": 5}

You can create any facts about your city that will support your proposal. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: From_\nToAll\nJosh,\n\nWe really have to make a decision about our business. Our landlord just wrote me another letter about the rent. Next month, it will be raised 25% to $4,500 per month. That's going to eat even more into our profits. I mean, Josh, that's $54,000 a year!\n\nI'm going to summarize our discussions here. I know that you are strongly in favor of just staying where we are and paying the higher rent. The obvious disadvantages of that are that our sales of clothing are increasing more slowly than our expenses AND with the rapid growth in Centerville, we can expect further rent increases in the coming months. The big pro for staying is that we're in a fashionable district where long-term customers know us. We're right downtown, so customers can come in on their lunch breaks to be measured for a suit or other high-end clothing.\n\nYou know that I favor going to a completely different model. We move to the south end of town for making the clothes, but create a system where we meet people in their offices or schools to measure them for new clothes. We also open up a much better webpage than what we have now so that customers can view our clothing options and enter their measurements. Incredible cost savings! The con of that is that we lose the showroom, where customers can just come in and look at the possibilities, feel the cloth and talk to us about what would be appropriate for them. Far less personalized service, which has helped us build close relationships with our customers.\n\nHonestly, I'd like another option, but I'm out of ideas. Should we talk to more people? I'm up for anything, but we really DO need to make a decision!\n\nThanks!\n\nKen", "label": 5}

Initially terrified, Arjuna instinctively aimed his arrow at the creature. However, upon noticing the lotus in its human hand, he realized its divine nature and refrained from attacking. The Navagunjara is believed to be a manifestation of Vishnu, symbolizing the unity of different life forms and the interconnectedness of existence.\nThis mythical creature is a powerful representation of harmony and balance, reminding people to look beyond appearances and recognize the deeper meaning in life.\n", "label": 5}

Do not hesitate to acknowledge your own efforts, even when they don't and ask peers for feedback.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language can be a rewarding journey, but it also comes with its share of challenges. What are the main obstacles faced by students? First, the fear of making mistakes is one of the biggest. This fear can inhibit practice and progress, as many are embarrassed to speak incorrectly. How can we deal with this fear? The key lies in constant practice and accepting mistakes as part of the learning process.\n\nAnother common challenge is the lack of immersion in the language. Without an environment where the language is used naturally and continuously, learning can become superficial. How can we overcome this? Watching movies, TV shows, reading books, and listening to music in the target language are effective ways to create an immersive context. Additionally, practicing with native speakers or other learners helps improve fluency.\n\nFinally, grammar and pronunciation can be tough barriers. How can we make these parts of the language more accessible? Studying gradually and focusing on specific areas using resources like apps and lessons can make understanding complex structures easier. Overall, perseverance, practice, and adapting to the new linguistic environment are essential to overcoming the challenges of learning a language.\n", "label": 5}

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Motivating employees is essential for the success and sustainability of any company, regardless of its size or industry. A motivated workforce is more productive, creative, and committed to achieving organizational goals. One of the most effective ways to inspire employees is by giving their work meaning. When people understand how their efforts contribute to the company’s mission and values, they feel more engaged and purposeful.\n\nProviding opportunities for professional development is also key. Training programs, mentorship, and chances to take on new responsibilities help employees grow and feel valued. Recognition is another powerful motivator—acknowledging both individual and team achievements boosts morale and reinforces positive behavior.\n\nOpen and transparent communication builds trust and encourages a culture of collaboration. Employees should feel heard and involved in decision-making processes. Additionally, offering flexibility—such as remote work options or flexible hours—can improve work-life balance and overall satisfaction.\n\nFinally, fostering a positive and inclusive workplace culture where employees feel respected and supported enhances motivation and loyalty. By combining these strategies, companies can create an environment where employees thrive, leading to better performance and long-term success.", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I firmly believe that companies hold a significant responsibility to society, extending well beyond the conventional puirsuit of maximizing shareholder profits. Businesses don't operate in a vacuum; they're deeply interwoven with communities, leveraging public resources, drawing from the local workforce, and relying on consumer trust to flourish. Their ecological footprint, labor practice, and influence on local economies directly shape collective well-being. This symbiotic relationship makes it ethically essential for corporations to contribute positively, rather than simply extracting value. Embracing sustianable operations, championing fair labor, and investing in community development aren't just ethical niceties; they're fundamental pillars for enduring business viability and a thriving societal ecosystem.\nIt's understandable, and frankly, often true, that some CSR initiatives can appear to be little more than clever marketing ploys. This cynical view, however, frequently misses the bigger picture. Genuine CSR initiatives forge invaluable brand equity, cultivate profound customer loyalty, and attract top-tier talent who are increasingly seeking purpose-driven organizations. Such authentic engagement transcends superficial public relations. It builds resillience, spurs innovation, and secures a vital \"social license to operate\" – assets that no amount of fleeting advertising can truly buy.\nUltimately, true corporate social responsibility shouldn't be viewed as a drain on profits, but rather as an indispensable component of sustianable profitability. It's about cultivating shared value, where business success and societal progress are mutually reinforcing. This approach ultimately serves the long-term interests of all stakeholders, including the shareholders, by fostering a more stable, prosperous, and ethical environment for everyone.", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: I recently ate at Flor de Goiás and was quite confused by the menu. The restaurant tries to embrace the world, offering Italian, Japanese, Brazilian, and even fast food. Unfortunately, this diversity didn't translate into excellence.\nThe Italian dish I ordered had a sloppy presentation and mediocre flavor, lacking fresh ingredients.

[SEP] Response: Hi Leon,\nThanks for opening up—writing is such a powerful way to process your thoughts, and you're doing that beautifully. The techniques that seem especially helpful in your situation are free writing and loop writing. Free writing lets you get everything off your chest without editing or filtering, which can be incredibly cathartic during tough times. Loop writing builds on that by helping you circle in on what’s really bothering you—like peeling layers off an onion until you find the core emotion or insight.\nMetaphor could also help express how things feel when words seem too blunt or literal. For example, describing your workplace as \"a ship lost at sea with no one at the helm\" captures a deep feeling in a way straightforward language can’t.\nThese techniques don’t just serve academic writing—they help us make sense of messy, real-life stuff too. Keep using them to explore your thoughts, and don’t hesitate to reach out again when the weight feels heavy. You're not alone in this.\n", "label": 5}

As you begin leading your team, motivating them effectively will be key to achieving both individual and collective success.\n\nFirst, incentivizing your employees is essential. Clearly link their contributions to the company’s success, and offer rewards—both monetary and non-monetary—as a way to acknowledge their efforts.

A balanced life leads to greater productivity and job satisfaction.\n\nFinally, ensure you consistently listen to your team’s concerns.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility: A Necessity, Not a Choice\n\nIn today’s world, I believe corporate social responsibility (CSR) is no longer just a bonus—it’s a necessity. Companies are not isolated from society; they are part of it and have a duty to contribute positively.\n\nFirst of all, CSR helps businesses build trust with consumers. In an age where people are more aware of environmental and social issues, companies that take responsibility for their impact tend to gain more loyalty. For example, brands that use sustainable packaging or support social causes often stand out from their competitors.\n\nSecondly, CSR benefits employees and the company itself. When workers feel that their employer is ethical and socially aware, they are often more motivated and loyal. This leads to higher productivity and lower turnover, which saves the company money in the long run.\n\nSome argue that CSR takes focus away from profit. However, I would argue that responsible practices and profit are not opposites. A company can do good and still do well financially—especially since today’s consumers often reward ethical behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, CSR is not about giving money away or looking good—it’s about doing business in a way that respects people and the planet. Companies that embrace this responsibility will not only help society but also ensure their own long-term success.", "label": 5}

It might help to set a short-term plan, maybe define what you need from your job to stay motivated and for how long you’re willing to wait for things to improve. In the meantime, keep documenting your wins and start quietly exploring new opportunities. Feeling like you have a backup plan can give you a sense of control.\n\nAbout Tia, relationships are tough, especially when expectations shift. If things aren’t working out, it’s okay to let go. Try to reflect on what you’ve learned from the relationship and give yourself time to process. No need to rush into closure.\n\nLastly, try carving out time for things that bring you peace, maybe exercise, meditation, or even just a walk.

By introducing herself and asking simple questions, Sophie is creating a network of contacts that can be valuable in her professional journey.\n\nFinally, this situation illustrates how small acts of communication can have a significant impact on organizational culture.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: In modern times,  CSR or corporate social responsibility is something every company should implement. When we talk aboud CSR, we refer to the responsibility companies should take for the impact their actions have on the environment they operate, wich for me is a non-negotiable thing when operating in a society.  \n\nCompanies are not isolated entities, every action and decision they make impactd the sociaty. They consume natural resources, rely on people as their workforce or even worse , can generate demografic and social changes. That's why,companies should return a little bit to the sociaty.  \n\nSomo people think the reason for a company to implement CSR is marketing, they only care about the image the customershave on them. That might be true but the positive impact of these actions does not differenciate the motives for why it was done.  \n\nCompanies need to think in their future, they need to invest in the sociaty. One good example is if they help or improve education. In the future, the will benefit of having prepared workforce. Also, a loved company is a cared company. If a company is loved, customers would not doub to help then in hard times.\n\nTo sum up, good actions will always be loved. Companies must have a social responsability, it's naiveto think that their actions don't create and effect on the enviroment they are.  \n", "label": 3}

This would cost about $1,200/month, a big savings from our current rent.\n\nOn top of that, we could launch a monthly pop-up showroom at Centerville’s new Artisan Market.

Nāgas are believed to be powerful, intelligent beings, often depicted as enormous serpents or half-human, half-serpent hybrids. In mythology, they dwell in underground palaces or beneath deep waters, guarding treasures and sacred places.\n\nNāgas have a dual nature: some are benevolent protectors, offering wisdom and blessings, while others are fearsome and vengeful if wronged. They are associated with water, fertility, and cosmic balance, making them prominent figures in temples, folklore, and artistic depictions.\n\nOne of the most famous Nāgas is **Shesha**, the thousand-headed serpent who serves as Lord Vishnu’s divine couch. In some tales, he holds up the universe, embodying infinite patience and devotion. Meanwhile, the **Kaliya Nāga** was subdued by Krishna when he poisoned the Yamuna River, showcasing the creature’s potentially dangerous side.\n\nWhether feared or revered, Nāgas remain an integral part of Indian mythology, symbolizing power, transformation, and the mysterious depths of existence.

Our landlord just wrote me another letter about the rent. Next month, it will be raised 25% to $4,500 per month. That's going to eat even more into our profits. I mean, Josh, that's $54,000 a year!\n\nI'm going to summarize our discussions here. I know that you are strongly in favor of just staying where we are and paying the higher rent. The obvious disadvantages of that are that our sales of clothing are increasing more slowly than our expenses AND with the rapid growth in Centerville, we can expect further rent increases in the coming months. The big pro for staying is that we're in a fashionable district where long-term customers know us. We're right downtown, so customers can come in on their lunch breaks to be measured for a suit or other high-end clothing.\n\nYou know that I favor going to a completely different model. We move to the south end of town for making the clothes, but create a system where we meet people in their offices or schools to measure them for new clothes. We also open up a much better webpage than what we have now so that customers can view our clothing options and enter their measurements. Incredible cost savings! The con of that is that we lose the showroom, where customers can just come in and look at the possibilities, feel the cloth and talk to us about what would be appropriate for them. Far less personalized service, which has helped us build close relationships with our customers.\n\nHonestly, I'd like another option, but I'm out of ideas. Should we talk to more people?

Garuda is often depicted as a powerful half-man, half-eagle figure with golden feathers, a beak-like nose, and wings so vast they can block the sun. In Hindu mythology, Garuda is the mount (vahana) of Lord Vishnu and is known for his immense strength, speed, and ability to traverse realms.\n\nGaruda symbolizes courage, power, and the triumph of good over evil. One popular tale tells of how he freed his mother from servitude by stealing the elixir of immortality from the gods — not for selfish reasons, but to honor a promise. This act made him both revered and feared among celestial beings.\n\nIn many Southeast Asian cultures, Garuda appears on national emblems and is celebrated as a guardian figure. What’s captivating about Garuda is how he bridges divine loyalty with fierce independence, making him not just a servant of the gods, but a hero in his own right.", "label": 5}

When the wealthy and reserved Mr. Darcy enters the scene, Elizabeth finds herself torn between her own pride and the social prejudices of the time.\n\nWith stunning photography and remarkable performances by Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, the plot represents a social critique of the standards of the time, but with a sensitivity and emotional appeal that enchants each new generation of viewers.", "label": 5}

The Wendigo is often described as a malevolent, supernatural being associated with cold, starvation, and greed. It is said to dwell in forests and prey on humans, especially during harsh winters. According to legend, the Wendigo was once a person who became possessed or transformed after resorting to cannibalism in desperate circumstances.\n\nVisually, the Wendigo is portrayed as tall and gaunt, with glowing eyes, sharp teeth, and an emaciated body. In some versions, it has antlers or a skeletal face, adding to its eerie presence. The creature symbolizes insatiable hunger and the consequences of losing one's humanity. It serves as a warning against selfishness and breaking moral boundaries.\n\nThe Wendigo has captured popular imagination and appears in many books, movies, and TV shows. Though its roots are in Indigenous mythology, its themes are universal—reminding us of the dangers of excess, isolation, and moral decay.

Offering mentorship and additional training demonstrates an investment in employees' career paths, encouraging growth and development. Prioritizing a healthy work-life balance acknowledges that employees have personal lives, enhancing their overall satisfaction and productivity. Active listening is crucial; when employees feel heard, especially when expressing concerns, their morale and output improve significantly. Cultivating a respectful atmosphere by treating subordinates as you would like to be treated by superiors reinforces a positive work environment. Avoiding negative behaviors such as disrespect, taking undue credit, losing temper, unfairly assigning blame, and neglecting to praise good work is essential. Together, these strategies create a supportive, rewarding environment that not only motivates employees but also drives company success. This could be suggested approach. ", "label": 5}

The area has recently developed into a commercial hub with lower rent than downtown but still attracts a professional crowd. We can set up a smaller showroom for personalized fittings while maintaining our tailoring unit separately to reduce costs.\nAdditionally, we can introduce a mobile tailoring service where stylists visit key business districts for fittings—capturing both convenience and personalization. With a refreshed online presence, clients can schedule appointments seamlessly. This option keeps our showroom alive, reduces expenses, and allows us to expand our customer base without sacrificing service quality.\n", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 12-Upper Intermediate [SEP] Prompt: You're going to reply to Alice's blog post about cross-cultural communication. Give advice about your own culture. Type in the input box. Write 50-75 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Thank you for sharing such an insightful post on cross-cultural communication! I completely agree with the point you made about how understanding cultural differences can not only enhance personal relationships but also improve collaboration in professional settings. The concept of “cultural intelligence” really stood out to me—it's fascinating how much more effective communication can be when we're aware of the subtleties that shape how people from different backgrounds interpret messages.\n\nI also appreciate your emphasis on active listening. It’s easy to assume that people from other cultures see the world the same way we do, but the truth is, language and non-verbal cues can vary significantly. Taking the time to listen and truly understand another person’s perspective is key, not just to avoid misunderstandings but also to show respect and build trust.\n\nOne aspect I’d love to explore more is how digital communication has impacted cross-cultural interactions. With so many people now connecting virtually from all corners of the globe, it’s interesting how technology both helps bridge gaps but can also present challenges, like the lack of non-verbal cues or different expectations for responsiveness.\n\nOverall, your post highlights an essential skill in today's interconnected world.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 15-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Technology and Human Life\n(Texto com cerca de 150 linhas)\n\nIn today’s world, technology is present in every part of our lives. From the moment we wake up to the time we go to bed, we are surrounded by devices, machines, and systems that make life easier, faster, and more connected.\n\nThe alarm clock on your smartphone wakes you up. You check your messages, look at the news, and maybe scroll through social media—all before getting out of bed. This is how deeply integrated technology has become in our daily routines.\n\nTransportation is another area transformed by technology. Cars today come with GPS systems, touchscreens, and even automatic driving features. Trains and airplanes are faster and more efficient, allowing us to travel across the world in a matter of hours. We can even use apps to call a ride within minutes.\n\nCommunication has evolved dramatically. A few decades ago, people had to write letters or use landline phones to speak to someone far away. Today, we have instant messaging, video calls, and emails. Social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok have changed the way we interact with others, share experiences, and express opinions.\n\nIn education, technology has opened new doors. Students can attend online classes, access libraries and research databases, and use educational apps that personalize learning. Teachers can create interactive lessons, share content digitally, and even assess students using digital tools.\n\nHealthcare has also improved because of technology. Modern hospitals use advanced machines for diagnosis, surgery, and patient care. Telemedicine allows doctors to consult with patients remotely. Artificial intelligence is being used to analyze medical data, detect diseases early, and suggest treatments.\n\nEntertainment has become more accessible than ever. Streaming platforms like Netflix and Spotify give us access to movies, shows, and music anytime, anywhere. Video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality offer immersive experiences that were once unimaginable.\n\nDespite all the benefits, technology also brings challenges. Many people feel overwhelmed by constant notifications and the pressure to always be online. Social media can cause anxiety, low self-esteem, and a false sense of reality. Misinformation spreads quickly online, making it hard to trust what we see or read.\n\nThere are concerns about privacy as well. Our personal data is stored in many places—from shopping websites to social networks. Hackers and cybercriminals can steal information, and even big companies have faced data leaks.\n\nAnother issue is dependency. Some people struggle to go even a few hours without their phones or the internet. This dependency can affect relationships, productivity, and even mental health. Children growing up in the digital age may have different social skills compared to those who grew up before screens were everywhere.\n\nThe job market has also been affected. While technology creates new careers in fields like coding, robotics, and data science, it also replaces many traditional jobs. Automation and artificial intelligence are expected to reduce the need for human workers in factories, stores, and even offices.\n\nEnvironmental concerns are another aspect. The production and disposal of electronic devices create a lot of e-waste. Mining for rare earth materials, which are used in tech products, can damage ecosystems. At the same time, technology also helps in finding solutions—like using AI to predict climate changes or developing clean energy sources.\n\nEthical questions arise as well. Should machines be allowed to make decisions that affect human lives? Who is responsible when a self-driving car causes an accident? What rules should govern the use of AI in warfare or surveillance?\n\nDespite these concerns, technology is not inherently good or bad. It depends on how we use it. When used wisely, it can improve lives, create opportunities, and solve problems. When abused, it can cause harm, division, and inequality.\n\nEducation plays a key role in this balance. People need to learn how to use technology responsibly. Digital literacy—knowing how to evaluate online information, protect your data, and behave respectfully online—is essential in today’s world.\n\nGovernments, companies, and individuals all have a role to play. Laws need to be updated to protect users. Tech companies must be transparent and prioritize ethical practices. And each person must make choices that reflect their values and respect others.\n\nIn conclusion, technology is a powerful tool. It shapes our world and influences every aspect of human life. It can connect or divide us, improve or complicate our lives, create or destroy. The future depends on how we choose to develop and use the technologies of tomorrow.\n\nLet us be curious but cautious, innovative but responsible. Let us use technology not just to build smarter machines—but to build a better world.\n\n", "label": 0}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: You are writing to Harry, a new manager in your company. He wants advice on how to effectively motivate his team and what strategies to avoid. Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Harry,\n\nHere are some ways to motivate your team and pitfalls to avoid. First, **incentivize your employees**—link their success to the company's goals and reward achievements. Take genuine interest in their careers by offering training and mentoring. Emphasize **work-life balance**, acknowledging their lives beyond the office. Listening actively fosters loyalty and morale. Finally, lead by example—treat team members how you'd want to be treated by your boss.\n\nAvoid actions that undermine morale. Never **disrespect employees** due to hierarchy. Avoid taking credit for others’ work, as it breeds resentment. Losing your temper damages trust and respect. Don’t let others shoulder blame unfairly—leaders protect, not scapegoat. Lastly, remember that praise and recognition go a long way. Failure to appreciate good work quietly drains motivation.\n\nMotivation doesn’t come from power—it comes from trust, fairness, and shared purpose.\n\nLet me know if you’d like this turned into an email or slide summary too.\n", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that‚Äôs popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most popular legendary creatures in India is the Naga, a serpent deity revered in Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Nagas are often depicted as half-human, half-serpent beings, possessing immense power and wisdom. They are believed to reside in the underworld, known as Patala, and are guardians of treasures and water bodies.\n\nNagas are considered both benevolent and malevolent. They can bring rain and fertility, ensuring the prosperity of the land, but they can also cause droughts and floods if angered. The most famous Naga is Shesha, the king of all Nagas, who serves as the bed for Lord Vishnu, one of the principal deities in Hinduism. Shesha is depicted with multiple heads, each symbolizing his vast knowledge and power.\n\nIn various myths, Nagas interact with humans, sometimes marrying them or bestowing blessings upon them. They are also associated with the protection of sacred texts and temples. The reverence for Nagas is evident in many festivals and rituals across India, where people offer prayers and milk to snake idols, seeking their favor and protection. This deep-rooted belief in Nagas highlights their significance in Indian culture and mythology.", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Genre:Thai supernatural horror\n\nRuntime: ~1h 35m\n\nDirector: Tiwa Moeithaisong\n\nPremise: A group of teen musicians staying in a Bangkok hotel becomes haunted by the spirit of a murdered prostitute. To survive, they must uncover the truth behind her death. \nThey’re terrorized by two entities: the murdered woman—possibly pregnant—and her sister’s ghost. Victims are driven to extreme acts (running into traffic, suicide, being sealed in a coffin), creating a relentless terror.\n\nReception\nCritics compared it unfavorably to “The Ring” or “The Grudge”, with some finding its scares predictable and execution cheesy—especially regarding editing and pacing.\nHowever, it has netted a cult following among Thai horror fans for its eerie atmosphere and relentless suspense. Audience reactions vary from “extremely creepy” to “cheap makeup but fun.” \n\nHighlights\nVisual Style: Moody and atmospheric, heavy use of green tones and confined spaces.\n\nCultural Context: Leans into Thai urban legend horror motifs, featuring long-haired ghosts and ghostly revenge.\n\nTwist: Presence of the sister as a second ghost adds a familial, vengeful layer to the haunting.\n\nComparisons and Variants: “Sisters” in Horror\nThere’s also “A Tale of Two Sisters”, a famous 2003 South Korean psychological horror by Kim Jee-woon. It’s lauded for its intricate storytelling and deep emotional undercurrents and stands separate from the Thai flick.", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: CSR, or corporate social responsibility, is a topic of ever growing importance in our society.\nIn my opinion, companies have a responsibility to society and CSR should be an essential part of the business.\nCompanies should set a good example and be a point of reference for the society around them.\nFor example, they should promote respect for the surrounding environment which has a great impact on the well-being of society.\nThey should care more about the well-being of their employees, let them work in a hazard-free office and provide them a fair employee benefit.\nCompanies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\nSome critics believe CSR is just a marketing device to buy a good public image, but we must not ignore the fact that this oftentimes is a win-win situation. If a company ensures fair benefits for its staff, it usually enjoys less turnover and higher productivity. By sponsoring improvements in society, the company is actually cultivating its future workforce. And on a global scale, operating sustainably helps ensure that all businesses have adequate resources to operate in the future.\nTo sum up, I believe CSR should be an innate part of business operations.", "label": 5}

I’ve been thinking a lot about our situation and want to propose a third option — what if we expanded or relocated to Cuiabá?\n\nCuiabá is a growing city in central Brazil with a vibrant economy and surprisingly low commercial rents — around $1,800/month for prime retail locations. It's becoming a hotspot for eco-conscious consumers and professionals, especially in the design and tourism industries, making it a great match for our custom high-end clothing. We could open a smaller, stylish storefront there as our new showroom — modern, affordable, and full of local character.\n\nWe’d still keep a smaller tailoring workspace nearby, and with lower costs, we could afford to offer free shipping for orders to Centerville and even travel up monthly for fittings at no extra cost. Cuiabá gives us space to grow, connect with a new client base, and increase our online presence — while maintaining the personal service we're known for.\n\nLet’s talk more about this idea. Could be a smart hybrid solution.\n\nBest,\nAna.", "label": 4}

I am writing this because I genuinely regret the impact of my actions/words/oversight and I want to fully acknowledge the pain, frustration, or inconvenience I've caused.

I now see that [**explain the direct negative impact, e.g., \"this put you in a difficult position,\" \"it caused you a lot of stress,\" \"it damaged our trust,\" \"it made you feel undervalued\"**]. I deeply regret that my actions led to [**describe the emotional or practical outcome, e.g., \"your disappointment,\" \"the financial loss,\" \"the wasted effort,\" \"a breach of confidence\"**].\n\nLooking back, I realize that I should have [**explain what you *should* have done differently, e.g., \"listened more carefully,\" \"thought before speaking,\" \"double-checked my work,\" \"communicated my difficulties sooner\"**]. My judgment was clearly flawed in this instance, and I am truly sorry for that lapse. I underestimated the importance of [**mention what you underestimated, e.g., \"our agreement,\" \"your feelings,\" \"the potential ramifications\"**] and for that, I am truly remorseful.\n\nI understand that an apology alone might not be enough to undo the damage, and I am prepared to do whatever it takes to make amends.

I am committed to learning from this experience and ensuring that such a situation does not recur.\n\nMoving forward, I am taking concrete steps to address the root causes of my mistake. For example, I will be [**mention specific actions you're taking, e.g., \"implementing a new organizational system,\" \"practicing more active listening,\" \"seeking advice from a mentor,\" \"reviewing my processes more diligently,\" \"working on my communication skills\"**]. My aim is to not only regain your trust but also to demonstrate through my actions that I am serious about my commitment to positive change.\n\nI genuinely hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I understand that forgiveness may take time, and I am willing to be patient and earn back your trust.

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi Harry,\n\nHere are some ideas to help you motivate your employees, along with things you should avoid.\n\nFirst, incentivize your employees by making them feel that the company’s success is also their success. Rewards are powerful motivators. Take an active interest in their career paths by offering additional training and acting as a mentor. Emphasize a healthy work-life balance—recognize that employees have lives outside of work. Listening is key; if employees feel heard, even when they are complaining, they will be happier and more productive. Above all, treat your subordinates with the same respect you would like from your own superiors.\n\nOn the other hand, avoid behaviors that demotivate your team. Don’t disrespect employees or take credit for their work. Losing your temper or unfairly blaming employees can damage morale. Also, don’t withhold compliments or praise for good work. Following these tips will help you build a motivated, productive team.\n\nBest regards,\nwinny.", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: Dear Ken,\n\nThank you for your detailed letter outlining the current situation. I appreciate you taking the time to summarize our discussions so clearly.\n\nThe 25% rent increase is certainly concerning, and I understand the financial strain it could put on our operations, especially given the slower growth in clothing sales. As you pointed out, this is a significant cost increase—$54,000 a year—and it’s a challenge to absorb that in an environment where our revenue isn't growing as quickly as expected.\n\nI also see the advantages of staying in the current location, particularly in terms of the customer base we’ve built in the downtown area. The long-term relationships and foot traffic are valuable, and it’s hard to underestimate the convenience of our location for many of our customers.\n\nThat being said, I’m leaning more toward your idea of transitioning to a new model, especially considering the long-term costs of staying in our current space. The idea of moving operations to the south end of town and offering more flexible, personalized services through home or office visits, along with a revamped website, is intriguing. I can see how it could save us a significant amount on overhead costs, and I’m particularly excited about the potential for expanding our customer reach.\n\nOf course, I do have concerns about losing the showroom experience and the more personal touch we’ve been able to offer our clients, but perhaps there’s a middle ground we can explore—like offering limited in-person appointments or pop-up events for those who want a more hands-on experience.\n\nI agree with you that we need to make a decision soon. I’d be open to exploring other options, including talking to more people or getting some external advice. Maybe we could even run a small survey with our existing customers to gauge how open they would be to this new approach. I’m committed to finding the best path forward for our business.\n\nLet’s schedule a meeting soon to discuss how we can move ahead with a decision that balances the pros and cons. I’m confident we’ll find a solution that works for both of us.\n\nBest regards,\nJosh\n\n", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: In today's interconnected world, I believe companies absolutely have a responsibility to society- not just to their shareholders. While making a profit is essential, businesses don't operate in a vacuum. They rely on people, communities, and the environment to thrive. Ignoring that relationship would be short- sighted.\n\nAs some have pointed out, CSR isn't just charity-it's smarty strategy. When companies treat employees fairly, support local communities, and reduce environmental harm, they build trust and loyalty. That leads to higher productivity, lower turnover, and stronger customer relationships.\nSure, governments create laws to protect the public. But laws to protect the public. But laws often lag behind public needs, and companies have the power- and the resources-to act faster. corporate social responsibility fills in those gaps.\nIn the end, doing good and doing well can go hand in hand. CSR is not a distraction from business-it's part of how modern businesses stay competitive and relevant in a changing world.\ntheG8T\nYes, companies should absolutely be responsible to society, not just shareholders. Business benefit from the communities they operate in, so giving back is only fair. CSR builds trust, boosts employee morale, and attracts loyal customers.\n", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: In my opinion, companies do have a responsibility to society, not just to their shareholders. Businesses are part of the world we all live in, so their actions affect more than just their profits.\n\nAs lil@213 wrote, companies benefit from the communities where they work. It seems fair that they also give something back. This can be through fair wages, good working conditions, or supporting specific local projects. It helps the community and also makes employees more motivated and loyal.\n\nJack@MSU also made a good point: consumers today care about how companies behave. A strong record in social responsibility can improve a company’s reputation and lead to better business results. So, CSR is not just about being kind – it can actually be good for business too.\n\nOf course, some people, like theG8T, say that a company’s only duty is to make money. But I think this view is too narrow. Companies need to think long-term, and that means caring about people and the planet.\n\nTo sum it up, I believe that corporate social responsibility is important.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Read an email from your friend and give advice on some stressful problems he is having. Type in the input box. Write 100-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi Leon,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. It's understandable to feel stressed with work and personal relationships, especially when both seem challenging at the same time. Here are a few thoughts that might help:\n\nWork Stress:\n\nCommunication: It might be helpful to have a candid conversation with your manager or team leader about your experiences and what motivates you. Sometimes management isn't aware of the impact their actions (or lack thereof) have on their team.\nFocus on What You Can Control: While it's frustrating not to receive acknowledgment, try to focus on the quality of your work and the satisfaction it brings you. Maybe set personal goals or find ways to recognize your own achievements.\nConsider Your Options: If things don't improve, it might be worth considering other opportunities. Updating your resume and exploring job openings can give you a sense of control and hope for change.\nRelationship Issues:\n\nOpen Dialogue: If you haven't already, try to have an honest conversation with Tia. Understanding each other's perspectives might help you decide the best course of action, whether that's working on the relationship or parting ways amicably.\nReflect on Your Needs: Consider what you need from a relationship and whether it's being met. This can help guide your decision and ensure future relationships are fulfilling.\nTake Time for Yourself: It's important to take care of yourself emotionally. Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax.\nGeneral Tips:\n\nSeek Balance: Make sure you're dedicating time to self-care and activities you enjoy, whether it's exercise, hobbies, or spending time with friends.\nReach Out: Don't hesitate to talk to a friend, family member, or therapist who can offer support.\nMindfulness Practices: Techniques like meditation or deep-breathing exercises can help manage stress and improve emotional well-being.\nRemember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and seeking support is a strong step toward managing these challenges. I'm here if you need someone to talk to or bounce ideas off of.\n\nTake care,", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Read an email from your friend and give advice on some stressful problems he is having. Type in the input box. Write 100-200 words. [SEP] Response: The first department store was created in Paris, in 1850. It was conceived as a big place with a lot of options in products and brands. They wouldn’t sell just a specific product: there you could  find clothes, shoes, jewels, make up and many others things. That concept remained until today. So, if you want to buy many things with good prices, you can choose from one of the thousands in the world.\n\nEvery year, on the day after Thanksgiving, most of this stores have a big sale called Black Friday. On this day, it is possible to buy products with big discounts and you also have the option to buy things online. In 2016, more than 154 million people spent USD 3,3 billion dollars shopping only on the internet.\n\nWalk of fame\n\nEven if you have never visited Los Angeles, you have probably heard about the most famous sidewalk in the world: the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Every year, around 10 million tourists visit this street to take pictures with their idol’s star.\n\nSince 1960, the Hollywood Boulevard Avenue attracts visitors to see star-plaques with the names of celebrities: actors, singers, movie directors, stage performers or anyone who has contributed to make Hollywood known worldwide. Each pink star is made of a marble called terrazzo, a bronze shield with the honoree’s name and an icon of the celebrity job, like a camera, television or a microphone, for example.\n\nThe Internet: A Remarkable Invention\nThe internet is one of the most amazing inventions in modern history. It all began in the 1960s when scientists created a way for computers to talk to each other. This network of connected computers grew over time, and in the 1990s, the internet became accessible to the public. Today, it plays a crucial role in our lives, allowing us to connect with people from all over the world, find information, and enjoy a world of entertainment. Thanks to this incredible invention, the way we communicate and learn has been transformed, making the world a smaller and more connected place.\n\nThe Grand Canyons: Nature’s Masterpiece\n", "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: Hi Leon , \n\nI'm glad you reached out. \n\nFirst, with work: it's incredibly demotivating when leadership doesn’t show appreciation, but try to separate your self-worth from their management style. You know you’re doing your best, and sometimes that’s all you can control. Look for small wins and maybe seek out a project or responsibility that reignites your motivation or aligns more with your strengths. If things remain toxic, it’s okay to quietly explore other opportunities that better value your contributions.\n\nAs for Tia—heartbreak, or the threat of it, is always heavy. But relationships that falter teach us more than the ones that glide easily. Give yourself space to process, and don’t rush to \"fix\" how you feel. Time and reflection often lead us to deeper clarity.\n\nAbove all, be kind to yourself. You’re doing more than you think, even just by showing up and reaching out. That takes strength.\n\nRegards,\nAll", "label": 5}

We all know that first, for companys in general, the revenue and the image of the business are the most important thing, but nowadays the society is understanding they need to be more critical with what they are consuming and interested.\nProbably, the future for most company will be to understand what the impact in the society and what image in the future is they would like to build.

Reports of the creature began in Puerto Rico in the 1990s and quickly spread across the Americas.\n\nDescriptions of the Chupacabra vary, but it is commonly portrayed as a reptilian or canine-like creature, about the size of a small bear, with sharp spines or quills along its back and glowing red eyes. Despite numerous eyewitness accounts, there is no scientific evidence proving the Chupacabra's existence. Many experts believe sightings are actually of diseased animals such as coyotes with mange.\n\nWhat makes the Chupacabra so intriguing is how quickly it became a modern legend, fueled by media and urban folklore. It represents the human tendency to explain the unknown through stories, often blending fear, mystery, and imagination. The Chupacabra continues to be a popular figure in pop culture, appearing in books, shows, and movies, capturing the curiosity of believers and skeptics alike.\n", "label": 5}

Our landlord just wrote me another letter about the rent. Next month, it will be raised 25% to $4,500 per month. That's going to eat even more into our profits. I mean, Josh, that's $54,000 a year!\n\nI'm going to summarize our discussions here. I know that you are strongly in favor of just staying where we are and paying the higher rent. The obvious disadvantages of that are that our sales of clothing are increasing more slowly than our expenses AND with the rapid growth in Centerville, we can expect further rent increases in the coming months. The big pro for staying is that we're in a fashionable district where long-term customers know us. We're right downtown, so customers can come in on their lunch breaks to be measured for a suit or other high-end clothing.\n\nYou know that I favor going to a completely different model. We move to the south end of town for making the clothes, but create a system where we meet people in their offices or schools to measure them for new clothes. We also open up a much better webpage than what we have now so that customers can view our c\nlothing options and enter their measurements. Incredible cost savings! The con of that is that we lose the showroom, where customers can just come in and look at the possibilities, feel the cloth and talk to us about what would be appropriate for them. Far less personalized service, which has helped us build close relationships with our customers.\n\nHonestly, I'd like another option, but I'm out of ideas. Should we talk to more people? I'm up for anything, but we really DO need to make a decision!\n\nThanks!\n\nKen", "label": 5}

Her experiences underscore a crucial point: effective communication across cultures doesn’t require perfection. Instead, it calls for empathy, cultural awareness, and a genuine willingness to adapt.

Or do you think a company's only responsibility is to its shareholders? We invite you to join this discussion by posting your opinion on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nFor CSR\n\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925 ", "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: After evaluating two potential training providers—TrainQuick and Skills Pro—we are leaning toward selecting Skills Pro despite its higher cost. TrainQuick offers a cheaper and more flexible option, which initially seemed appealing. However, we’ve encountered some key concerns. Notably, employees at our other branch have not engaged with TrainQuick's programs, suggesting low uptake or lack of motivation. Additionally, staff members have expressed dissatisfaction with being grouped into sessions that mix participants from different branches, which has negatively impacted their learning experience and engagement.\n\nIn contrast, Skills Pro, while more expensive, appears to deliver stronger results. Although some participants have found the course content challenging, a significant number have completed the training successfully. This speaks to both the effectiveness of the program and the commitment it fosters in participants. Furthermore, Skills Pro has plans to expand its course offerings, which suggests a forward-thinking approach and potential long-term value.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 9-Intermediate [SEP] Prompt: Write a summary of a negotiation.

What happened during the negotiations? What was the final deal? Type in the input box. Write 100-150 words. This activity is non-graded. [SEP] Response: Last month, I negotiate the purchase of a used laptop for work. The seller’s preliminary offer was $500. I checked the laptop’s condition and found that the battery life was weak, and the screen had a small scratch. I told the seller about the issues and offer $400. He said he could not go that low, but he would include a new charger and a laptop case if I paid $450. I still felt it was high, so I offered $430 as my final price. After some thinking, the seller accepted. The final deal was $430, including the laptop, a charger, and a case. It was a fair negotiation because both sides gave something up and reached a soluction. I felt happy with the result, and the seller seemed satisfied too. This small negotiation helped me feel more secure when buying things. I also learned that listening, observing details, and staying calm are important skills.\n\n\n", "label": 4}

The two principal candidates are TrainQuick and Skills Pro.\n\nTrainQuick remains our choice in terms of cost and flexibility.  The major drawback is its learning style.

It is more expensive.\n\nTrainQuick may be the better choice in terms of cost-effectiveness. However our priority is to develop the skills of our employees.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature that’s both haunting and fascinating is the *Nandi Bear* from East African folklore. Though not from India, its mystique has captivated imaginations worldwide.\n\nThe Nandi Bear is said to roam the highland regions of Kenya and Uganda. Descriptions of it vary—some say it resembles a giant hyena with a sloping back and powerful limbs, others depict it as more bear-like with reddish fur and razor-sharp claws. What makes it particularly fearsome is its supposed habit of attacking livestock, and in rare tales, even humans.\n\nLocals have passed down stories of its terrifying growls echoing in the night, and some claim it’s a remnant of a long-extinct prehistoric beast. Despite numerous alleged sightings, no physical evidence has ever confirmed its existence, earning it a place in the shadowy world between myth and zoology.\n\nWhether it’s a misidentified animal or a relic of ancient times, the Nandi Bear remains an enduring symbol of the unknown—reminding us that even in the modern age, some mysteries still prowl just out of sight.  \n\nWould you like to hear about an Indian mythical creature too?

It involves looking back at your actions, decisions, and outcomes to understand what went well and what could have been improved. Whether after completing a project, giving a presentation, or participating in a team effort, taking the time to evaluate your performance can provide important insights. For example, identifying strengths allows you to build confidence and continue using effective strategies in the future. On the other hand, recognizing weaknesses or mistakes is the first step toward improvement. Reflection also encourages responsibility and accountability, as it helps you own your actions and learn from them. Many professionals use tools like self-assessment forms or journals to support this process.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: \n\nThe Great Online Debate: Corporate Responsibility\n\nIn today’s world, the role of companies is under constant debate. Some believe that a company’s only responsibility is to generate profit for its shareholders. After all, investors take risks and deserve a return. However, I believe businesses also have a responsibility to society.\n\nCompanies do not exist in a vacuum. They rely on communities, customers, employees, and the environment to function and grow. Ignoring the social and environmental impact of their actions can lead to long-term harm, not only to society but also to the company itself. For example, poor labor practices or pollution can damage a brand’s reputation and reduce consumer trust.\n\nOn the other hand, businesses that invest in fair wages, sustainability, and community development often build stronger relationships and long-term success. Therefore, while profit is important, it should not come at the cost of people or the planet. Companies must act responsibly for everyone’s benefit.\n\nSe quiser adaptar para um nível mais básico ou mais avançado, posso ajustar!\n\nVocê disse:\nReescreva com 200 palavras\nO ChatGPT disse:\nClaro! Aqui está a versão reescrita com cerca de 200 palavras:\n\nThe Great Online Debate: Corporate Responsibility\n\nThere is an ongoing debate about the true responsibility of companies. Some people argue that a business exists only to make a profit and serve the interests of its shareholders. From this perspective, as long as a company is legally compliant and profitable, it is fulfilling its purpose. However, I believe companies have a broader responsibility to society.\n\nBusinesses operate within communities and benefit from public resources, such as infrastructure, education, and the environment. Therefore, they should give back and contribute positively to the world around them. For example, companies should treat their employees fairly, support local development, and reduce environmental harm. These actions not only help society but can also benefit the company in the long run by building consumer loyalty and trust.\n\nMoreover, in today’s digital world, information spreads fast. A company’s social and ethical behavior is under constant public scrutiny. Those that ignore their social impact risk boycotts, protests, or public backlash. On the other hand, socially responsible businesses often attract more customers and investors who care about values, not just profits.\n\nIn conclusion, while making money is essential, companies should also act with responsibility, considering the well-being of people, communities, and the planet.", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: The Library of Alexandria (Ancient Greek: Βιβλιοθήκη τῆς Ἀλεξάνδρειας; Latin: Bibliotheca Alexandrina) was one of the most significant and celebrated libraries and one of the greatest centers of knowledge production in antiquity. Established during the 3rd century BC in the palace complex of the city of Alexandria in the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, the Library was part of a research institution called the Mouseion. The idea for its creation may have been proposed by Demetrius of Phalerum, an exiled Athenian statesman, to the satrap of Egypt and founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty, Ptolemy I Soter, who, like his predecessor, Alexander the Great, sought to promote the spread of Hellenistic culture. However, the Library was probably not built until the reign of his son, Ptolemy II Philadelphus. It acquired a large number of papyrus scrolls, mainly due to the aggressive and well-funded policies of the Ptolemaic kings to obtain texts. It is not known exactly how many works it had in its collection, but it is estimated that it once housed between thirty thousand and seven hundred thousand literary, academic and religious volumes. The Library's collection grew to such an extent that, during the reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes, a branch was established in the Serapeum of Alexandria.\n\nIn addition to serving as a demonstration of power for the Ptolemaic rulers, the Library played a significant role in the emergence of Alexandria as the successor to Athens as a center of Greek culture. Many important and influential scholars worked on it, notably Zenodotus of Ephesus, who sought to standardize the texts of the Homeric poems and produced the earliest known record of the use of alphabetical order as a method of organization; Callimachus, who wrote the Pinakes, probably the world's first library catalogue; Apollonius of Rhodes, who composed the epic poem The Argonautica; Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who first calculated the conditions of the Earth, with unusual results; Aristophanes of Byzantium, who invented the system of Greek diacritics and was the first to divide poetic texts into lines; and Aristarchus of Samothrace, who produced the definitive texts of the Homeric poems and extensive commentaries on them. In addition to these, there are references to the community of the Library and Mouseion of Alexandria also having temporarily included numerous other figures who developed rigorous scholarship, such as Archimedes and Euclid.", "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: You might go into a meeting with ideas you'd like to share. One way to offer your ideas is to start with something that or one thing that, to get the other participants' attention.\nNotice the phrasal verbs here that describe the emergence of an idea: come to mind, strike me and come up.\nSomething that came to mind was that it might not match our customer base.\nOne thing that struck me was how bulky and heavy it was.\nOne idea that came up was whether we should reconsider our sales strategy.\nOne way to increase the impact of your idea is to add background information about how you came up with it.\nSomething that came to mind when I was reviewing the design was that it might not match our customer base.\nOne thing that struck me as I looked at the new product was how bulky and heavy it was.\nAsking about previous actions\nIt's best not to be too direct when you ask about what your colleagues have previously done. For example, you can use a passive structure instead of referring to people directly:\nHas any research been done on the African market?\nIt's always safer if you include additional hedging or softening language, as in the following examples:\nIt doesn't seem like any project has been run to collect our customers' experience using the new projector, is that right?\nI'm wondering what's been done up till now about improving our brand image.\nI'm curious to know if any research has been done in this area.\nExpressing willingness\nHere are a few effective phrases to convey your willingness to take on a task.\nI'd be really keen to lead the project.\nMy team would love the chance to investigate the root cause of this problem.\nI'd be more than willing to take on the user research.\nI'd like to put myself and my team forward for solving this problem.\nYou can use the phrase a good fit to emphasize that you're a suitable choice.\nI think I'd be a good fit for this project.\nHere are ways to downplay your willingness for tasks you don't want to take on or you think you can't handle.\nI could give it a shot if it's considered really urgent.\nI guess our team could take it on if everyone agrees that it's top priority.\nReflecting in a journal\nEvery day, different things happen in your work and study. Keeping a journal of key events can provide a valuable record of your performance and progress. It also allows you to look at what you've done from a different, more objective, perspective.\nWhen you're reflecting on your day, it's helpful to guide yourself through a series of questions. Here are a few examples:\nWhat happened today? What was the cause? What was the outcome?\nWhat were today's highlights? What were the setbacks?\nWhat did I do well? What did I not do so well?\nWhat would I do differently next time? What can I practice doing better right now?\nAs you continue to update your journal, you can add to or remove these guiding questions, depending on which you find useful. Remember to return to previous entries and reflect on whether the suggestions you made at that time are working for you now.\nDescribing adaption\nAdaption, or getting used to a new environment, can be challenging. It's helpful to let others know how you're getting on. If you found something easy to learn, a nice way to say that is:\nI got the hang of all of our product lines quite easily.\nWhen the adaption has taken some effort, you can use phrases like these:\nIt's taken me a while to understand the concept of strategic orientation.\nI've finally managed to push our team forward in meetings.\nYou may have over- or underestimated the effort it would take to get used to something.

You can describe things you would have done differently in the past:\nI didn't think of it then, but what I should have done was create an online shared space.\nYou can look to the future:\nSo, one thing I need to do is reassess how I approach people with more experience than me, so I can improve my communication.\nNext time, when I'm having a meeting, I should also keep in mind that I represent my whole team.\nIf you're not sure your idea will work, you can express yourself more tentatively:\nI don't know if it's going to be any faster, but next time I might just book a meeting with someone who's got the knowledge.\n\n", "label": 1}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most fascinating legendary creatures from Indian mythology is the Navagunjara, a composite beast that appears in the Odia retelling of the Mahabharata. This mythical creature is said to be a manifestation of Lord Vishnu and is a symbol of unity in diversity.\nThe Navagunjara is a surreal blend of nine different animals. It has the head of a rooster, the neck of a peacock, the hump of a bull, the waist of a lion, and the tail of a serpent. It stands on three legs—those of an elephant, a tiger, and a deer—while its fourth limb is a human arm holding a lotus. This bizarre yet majestic form is meant to represent the many facets of the divine and the interconnectedness of all life.\nAccording to legend, the Navagunjara appeared before Arjuna during his penance. Initially startled, Arjuna aimed his bow at the creature, but upon recognizing the lotus and sensing its divine nature, he lowered his weapon in reverence.\nThe Navagunjara is not just a mythical oddity—it’s a powerful symbol of harmony, reminding us that beauty and wisdom often lie in the unexpected.\n", "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: After evaluating two training providers—TrainQuick and Skills Pro— I believe Skills Pro is the better option, despite its higher cost. While TrainQuick is more affordable and offers flexible scheduling, it has notable drawbacks. Employees from other branches are not engaging with the platform, and our staff has expressed discomfort when placed in mixed-branch classes. This affects participation and overall learning outcomes.\nOn the other hand, Skills Pro is more expensive and its course content is considered challenging. However, this challenge appears to be a strength rather than a weakness. Employees who enroll in Skills Pro tend to complete the course successfully, indicating that the program is both rigorous and effective. Additionally, Skills Pro has plans to expand its course offerings, which suggests a commitment to continuous improvement and long-term value.\nIn conclusion, although Skills Pro requires a larger investment, the quality of training, higher completion rates, and future growth potential make it the smarter choice. When it comes to professional development, quality should be the priority—and Skills Pro delivers on that promise.\n\n", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language can be exciting, but it also comes with many challenges. One common issue is pronunciation. Some sounds may not exist in a student's first language, so it's hard to say them correctly. This can make students feel shy when speaking.\nAnother challenge is vocabulary. It takes time to learn new words and remember them. Many students also struggle with grammar rules, which can be confusing or different from their native language.\nConfidence is another big problem. Some students understand well but are afraid to speak because they don’t want to make mistakes. This can slow down their progress.\nFinally, lack of practice is a major issue. If students don’t use the language often—by speaking, reading, or listening—they may forget what they learned.\nTo improve, students can try to practice every day, even for a short time. Watching videos, reading short texts, and speaking with others helps a lot. It's also important to be patient and not give up. Making mistakes is a normal part of learning.", "label": 4}
