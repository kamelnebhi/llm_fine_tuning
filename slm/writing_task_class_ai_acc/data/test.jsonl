I'm here to share the story of our journey- one that's taken us through bumps, detours and breakthroughs and that now has us on a clear strong road forward. \nOne of the biggest milestone on this road was reaching a renewed partnership with Crum. This wasn't just a pit stop, it was a major checkpoint, showing we are moved in the right direction and gaining momentum. \nCrum has decided to stay on the journey with us not just because of where we have been but because of where we are going. They have seen our persistence, our drive to improve and they are confident in the direction we are heading together.\nThey matched our commitment to quality with their trust, and it's that shared vision that keeps this partnership going forward. Our dedication to doing things right even when the roads get tough was what kept them on board.\nBut let's rewind a bit, about three months ago we hit some potholes. Minor defects and lingering in technical issues started to slow us down. They weren't major breakdowns but they had the potential to throw us off course.\nSo, we calibrated. We pulled over, took a hard look under the hood and made the necessary upgrades. We tightened our quality assurance engine, fine tuned our workflows, and checked every part of the process to ensure a smoother ride ahead.\nAs we look ahead, we are not just cruising we are accelerating with purpose. We are investing in stronger support system to make sure our teams and our partners avoid roadblocks altogether. With Crum beside us and quality leading the way we are not heading towards the future we are paving it.

[SEP] Response: This proposal outlines a unique opportunity to capitalize on a niche in the hotel market by offering a highly customized, luxury boutique experience. The concept targets affluent travelers seeking personalized services and culturally immersive stays. Backed by a partnership with Kudos Advertising Agency, an intensive media campaign will ensure strong brand recognition. Projections indicate a $1 million profit annually after the second year, with initial investment recouped within four years of opening under standard economic conditions. If the economy remains stable, the recovery period and profitability timelines could be halved, making this a highly lucrative venture.\n\nRisk Assessment\nEconomic downturns have been carefully accounted for in financial projections, ensuring a resilient business model. While economic instability poses a potential risk, strategic planning and an aggressive marketing approach mitigate its impact. Additionally, leveraging industry trends and targeting a high-spending demographic increase revenue stability.

Here are a few thoughts that might help:\n\nWork Situation: Dealing with unacknowledged efforts can be very demotivating. If possible, try to have a conversation with your new management. Express your concerns and see if there are any ways to improve communication and recognition at work. You might also find it helpful to seek support from your colleagues—sometimes knowing you're not alone can make a big difference.\n\nRelationship with Tia: Relationships can be complicated, and it's important to recognize when things aren't working out. If you haven't already, have an open and honest conversation with Tia about how you're feeling. Sometimes, communication can help resolve misunderstandings or confirm that it's time to move on. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your well-being and make decisions that are best for you.\n\nSelf-Care: Make sure you're taking time for yourself amidst all this. Whether it's through exercise, meditation, or a hobby you enjoy, finding ways to relax and recharge is crucial. Talking to a therapist or counselor might also provide you with some additional support.\n\nStay Connected: Even if it feels like you don't have many people to talk to, reaching out to friends or family members, even if it's just for a casual chat, can help you feel more supported.\n\nIt's great that you're reaching out and seeking advice. Remember, you're not alone, and taking steps to address these issues is already a positive move forward.\n\nTake care,\n\nAnav", "task_id": "9032f3ed-5da1-4efe-b4dd-c9470bb35d65", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Military [SEP] Prompt: Summarize the siege incident in no more than 50 words. Use the text to help you. Compare your text with the model. This is a non-graded activity. [SEP] Response: Careers are available for men and women irrespective of race, ethnic origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation or social background. (N.B. The RAF Regiment, which is a specialist fighting force, is not open to women, for reasons of combat effectiveness.)\n\nCareers are available for school leavers with minimal qualifications and also for young people who have specialist skills or university degrees. It is unlikely that young people without qualifications will be promoted to the highest ranks. However, it is possible if they gain qualifications during their RAF career. They are encouraged to do so.\n\nSchool leavers can apply at age 16 and learn a trade through on-the-job training.\n\nStudents who have stayed on at school and achieved pass marks or higher in national exams have an increased number of career options available. School leavers will join as aircraftmen or women and during their careers may be promoted to the highest non-commissioned ranks and, in some cases, become commissioned officers.\n\nUniversity graduates enter as officers. Sponsorships are available for students in the last two years at school and/or in university.\n\nThere are over 50 different careers in the RAF. Ask the young person about  interests and skills before giving advice about specific careers. Use the materials you have been given, which will help you match the young person with suitable jobs.\n\nMany applicants are interested in jobs that will put them on board aircraft. Explain that this is more likely if the young person is a graduate or has specific qualifications. However, school leavers who join as non-commissioned aircrew (NCA) will train as weapon systems operators and will work on board fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters and may specialize in acoustics, electronic warfare or linguistics. The training for these jobs is up to three years. On completing training, there is automatic promotion to sergeant.\n\nYoung people wishing to become pilots can apply on leaving school at 17.5 years old or older. They must have good results in national examinations. They should be encouraged to apply for sponsorship and given advice about subjects to study at school and university. Explain that the young person will be tested in order to establish their aptitude for a career as a pilot. Also explain that once they have completed their elementary flying training, they will be streamed to fly fast jets, multi-engine aircraft or helicopters according to their capabilities. Not all pilots are fighter pilots. Many pilots spend their careers ferrying troops or supplies.\n\nThere is a shortage of air traffic controllers. Encourage school leavers to consider this job. They must have a minimum of five good results in the national exams taken at age 16. These must include English and maths. They will have to take aptitude tests and will join as non-commissioned aircrew. ", "task_id": "dfc6e64d-9c86-4def-8474-17be136ac1a5", "level_title": "Military", "label": 0}

Should the economy remain stable, the period required for recouping the investment and realizing profits could be reduced by half. \nAn intensive media campaign, planned by Kudos Advertising Agency, will ensure strong market presence and customer engagement. \nThis strategic approach mitigates risks and positions Zen Boutique Hotel for success in the competitive hospitality market.", "task_id": "0efc8863-e086-4c4a-aa14-7f688dec4cb3", "level_title": "Correspondence", "label": 5}

I think that your lifestyle is not very healthy.\nFirst of all, I will tell you that you must give up smoking or you will have serious diseases in the future.\nYou should also avoid drinking so much coffee, one or two coffees a day would be enough. You can try to drink decaf, which will allow you to sleep better at night and you will feel better in the mornings.\nSome exercise will also be helpful. Every two hours you could stand up from your seat and walk around the office. On the weekends, instead of watching films you can go for a walk or a ride on your bicycle because being in contact with Nature improves your breathing capacity.\nOn the other hand, you must eat healthy food, avoid hamburgers, sausages, etc. and eat fruit, vegetables and fish.\nAnd last, but not least, you must try to decrease your level of stress, for instance going to a spa or practising yoga.\n", "task_id": "1e1666cf-3408-4a45-98ef-823784c658f4", "level_title": "Society and Leisure", "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, forced free writing and listing seem most useful to me. Focused free writing allows me to explore a single idea in depth without worrying about grammar or structure. It helps me develop my thoughts freely while staying on topic, which is especially helpful during the early stage of writing. It feels like a brainstorming session that clears my mind and sharpens my focus.\nListing, on the other hand, is a simple yet powerful technique that helps me organize my thoughts quickly. When I'm overwhelmed with ideas, listing allows me to break them down into manageable points. It's especially helpful when planning an easy or project, as it gives a clear direction or development. I also find metaphor useful because it adds creativity and deeper meaning to my writing. By comparing one thing to another, metaphors help readers understand complex ideas in a more relatable way. Overall, these techniques  make writing easier, clearer, and more engaging.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}

Gone are the frantic mornings of juggling breakfast with the morning commute, replaced by a communal gathering fueled by fresh fruit, steaming coffee, and the camaraderie of colleagues.\nThis isn't just about nourishment; it's an investment in our collective well-being. Studies have shown that a healthy breakfast improves focus, boosts energy levels, and enhances overall productivity.

Colleagues can connect over a cup of coffee, share stories, and build stronger relationships. These informal interactions foster a more positive and collaborative work environment, ultimately benefiting both individuals and the company as a whole. This initiative is a testament to the company's understanding that a happy and well-nourished workforce is a thriving and successful one.\nKey changes:\n * More engaging language: Used vivid imagery (\"Imagine a morning...\"), stronger verbs (\"ushering in,\" \"demonstrates a commitment\"), and more impactful phrases (\"investment in our collective well-being,\" \"vibrant hub of social interaction\").\n * Focus on benefits: Highlighted the positive impact on employee well-being, productivity, and company culture.\n * Concise and impactful: Delivered the message in a more concise and impactful manner while maintaining a professional tone.\nI hope this revised version is more engaging and effective!", "task_id": "f5b9e75a-4373-4e94-86eb-0df64619d29a", "level_title": "14-Advanced", "label": 5}

This mean to ensure there is a reward after success, this mean monitoring your team's performance, asses it and reward when the benchmark is reached or surpassed. You can use multiple options, such as prizes, bonus or even vouchers. \nAs part of your initial query, were are some behaviors you need to avoid: \n1. Lose your temper: although as a leader you will face stressful situations, keep calm, get together and then act. Remember good leadership lead by example. \n2. Don't let your team take blame for things: even if they commit an error, do nor focus on that but in how to improve, and\n3. Avoid compliment: some leaders don't compliment their teams after a success as they don't want them to \"do thing because of the compliment\", ignoring the fact that positive words of recognition can boost your team morale while provide feedback on their work. \n\nTo summarize the above, connect with your team to recognize their motivation and the proper way to approach them. \n\nDo not hesitate to reach out again in case further questions arise. \n\nRegards, \n\nJose", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 3}

We understand that recent discussions, particularly concerning our share prices, may have caused apprehension, and we want to provide you with a clear and reassuring perspective.\n\nFirstly, let us be unequivocal: rumors about our share prices continuing to decline and potentially wiping out your investments are entirely unfounded. We acknowledge that our share value experienced a temporary drop approximately two months ago. This was directly linked to the resignation of our former CEO, Greg Johnson, a period of transition that understandably created some market uncertainty.\n\nHowever, we are thrilled to confirm that under the leadership of our new CEO, Harry Levi, our share value not only recovered swiftly but has also quickly escalated to a historic high. Harry Levi is a highly respected and well-known figure in the construction industry, and his vision and expertise are already steering Future Foundations towards unprecedented success.\n\nIn this otherwise unstable market, we are actively taking measures to maintain robust stability. We are proud to announce that we have successfully secured three substantial contracts for the coming three years, guaranteeing a strong pipeline of work and, crucially, a solid profit margin. This strategic move ensures our financial health and continued growth, providing a strong foundation against market fluctuations.\n\nWe are incredibly grateful for your continued loyalty and trust in Future Foundations. Your confidence is vital to us, and we are committed to demonstrating that the future of our company is exceptionally bright. To further reinforce this commitment and provide comprehensive reassurance, we will be sharing Future Foundations' detailed five-year road map with you shortly.\n\nThank you for being an integral part of our journey.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nThe Future Foundations Construction Company Team", "task_id": "c2ac7c1e-b808-4c21-8ee1-c1abac0c2a49", "level_title": "Correspondence", "label": 5}

In the other hand, one thing that has always bugged me was the weather; which can be very cold and with short days, making people quiet and close.\n\n     Likewise the time in Sweden, live in Lima was just wonderful. \nLima is a Metropolis, with more than 10 million habitants, traffic congestion everywhere, noise of the horns and air pollution. But one of the most extraordinary thing there is people; they are happy, and open to new comers. Another aspect I loved was the culture, inside town there are still well-preserved pyramids and others archaeological sites from civilizations more than thousand years old, pre-Incas. \nAnd for sure, in Peru there are one of the best foods in the word, it’s just incredible.\n\nEven though there is a clear difference between those cities, it´s important to consider that there are pros and cons in both.

These parts keep the airplane stable and help control its direction. The vertical stabilizer helps the airplane turn left or right, while the horizontal stabilizer controls the up and down movement.\nFinally, the engines provide the power needed for the airplane to move forward.

From what I've observed, effective leaders often exhibit qualities such as empathy, integrity, and resilience. Empathy allows leaders to understand and connect with their team, fostering a supportive and collaborative environment. Integrity builds trust and sets a strong ethical foundation, while resilience helps leaders navigate challenges and setbacks with a positive attitude.\n\nOne key aspect of developing leadership is self-reflection. Regularly assessing your strengths and areas for improvement can guide your growth. Seeking feedback from peers and mentors also provides valuable insights. Additionally, embracing opportunities for learning, whether through formal education, workshops, or reading, can enhance your leadership skills.\n\nPractical experience is crucial. Taking on leadership roles in various settings, such as volunteer organizations or project teams, allows you to apply and refine your skills. It's also important to observe and learn from other leaders, noting what strategies and behaviors are effective.\n\nI believe everyone has the potential to be a leader, though the path may look different for each person. Leadership is not just about holding a title; it's about influencing and inspiring others, which can be achieved in many ways.", "task_id": "ce3f3898-f2a7-4978-8f4f-17596f229f1d", "level_title": "12-Upper Intermediate", "label": 5}

Realizing the horror of what she had done, she drowned herself as well. Her soul was cursed to wander the earth for eternity, searching for her children. People say that on quiet nights near rivers or lakes, you can hear her crying, “¡Ay, mis hijos!” (“Oh, my children!”). She is often described wearing a long white dress, with long black hair and a pale, sorrowful face. Many parents use this legend to warn children not to go out at night or near dangerous waters. La Llorona is more than just a ghost story — she reflects themes of love, betrayal, guilt, and punishment, which are deeply rooted in Mexican culture and folklore.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: \nIn a tort action case involving trespassing, the plaintiff, the Byron family, accused Mr. Medina of breaking into their home, leaving them distressed and terrorised. Although the plaintiff mentioned that Medina took valuables, specific items were not identified. On the defence side, Mr. Medina claimed he believed the house was empty and sought shelter during the night out of fear. However, he admitted to ransacking the house.\n\nThe judge ruled that trespassing constitutes a criminal offence, holding Medina liable for his actions. As a result, the verdict was in favour of the Byrons. Mr. Medina was fined $1,000, to be paid in two instalments, with one payment due immediately. Additionally, he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. This case underscores the serious legal implications of trespassing, highlighting the balance between personal accountability and understanding the circumstances that led to the offence. \nThis ruling serves as a reminder of the importance of respecting private property and the potential consequences of failing to do so. It also highlights the court's consideration of both the impact on the victims and the circumstances surrounding the defendant's actions. By imposing a fine and community service, the judgment aims to provide restitution to the Byrons and encourage Medina's rehabilitation and understanding of his wrongdoing.", "task_id": "bb0d114c-9550-4f27-9138-b2eb14c39437", "level_title": "Law", "label": 5}

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: Hang Seng Index Rises Sharply on Mainland Investment\n\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI) in Hong Kong has shown steady and impressive growth over the past six months, driven largely by strong investment flows from Mainland China. Six months ago, the HSI dropped to 20,956, reflecting investor caution amid global uncertainty. However, since then, it has climbed steadily, reaching a high of 27,499, highlighting renewed market confidence.\n\nMuch of this growth has been led by the Properties and Utilities Sub-indices, which have risen dramatically as China’s continued economic expansion fuels demand in these sectors. Mainland investors have sought stable returns in Hong Kong’s property and utilities markets, contributing significantly to the index’s upward momentum.\n\nLooking ahead, experts believe the HSI will continue to rise next year. This positive outlook is supported by expectations of massive investment from other countries seeking opportunities in Hong Kong’s stable market, along with strong internal demand from local investors.\n\nWhile challenges remain in the global economy, the Hang Seng’s recent performance reflects Hong Kong’s resilience and its continued attractiveness as a financial hub in the region.\n\nLet me know if you need a matching graph caption or a condensed LinkedIn post version for your editor’s portfolio.", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 5}

DNA testing confirmed that several northern flocks previously believed to be robins represent a genetically distinct species. The newly identified bird is slightly smaller, with a larger bill and rustier plumage in males. Unlike the American robin, it does not migrate south of Canada during winter. The bird occupies similar habitats, favoring temperate forests and open woodlands. Based on its behavior, appearance, and geographic distribution, the proposed scientific name is Turdus canadensis. This discovery contributes valuable information to the understanding of avian biodiversity in North America and highlights the importance of molecular testing in modern taxonomy.\n\n", "task_id": "76bba4e9-a91a-49e2-89a6-129b5a013873", "level_title": "Sciences", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In today’s media-driven world, the concept of celebrity often prioritizes visibility over real contribution. A striking example is Brazil’s influencer culture, where figures like Carlinhos Maia command millions of followers despite offering little in terms of cultural, scientific, or social value. His extravagant lifestyle, endless self-promotion, and controversial behavior reflect a growing trend: fame detached from substance.\n\nWhile such personalities can entertain, their massive influence raises concerns. Young audiences, for instance, may equate success with online popularity rather than education, effort, or ethical behavior. This can distort aspirations and values. Moreover, these celebrities often monetize intimate aspects of their lives, promoting superficial ideals of beauty, consumption, and status.\n\nUnlike artists, scientists, or educators who contribute meaningfully to society, many digital celebrities thrive on controversy and sensationalism. This not only lowers the bar for public discourse but also diverts attention from people doing valuable, yet less glamorous, work.\n\nTo build a more thoughtful society, Brazil must reconsider who we choose to admire. By celebrating individuals for their integrity, talent, and social impact — rather than just their follower count — we can inspire future generations to value depth over display.\n\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: You are writing to Harry, a new manager in your company. He wants advice on how to effectively motivate his team and what strategies to avoid. Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Dear Harry,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some strategies for effectively motivating your team, along with a few pitfalls to avoid.\n\nFirstly, incentivize your employees. When they see that the company's success translates to their own success, it can be a powerful motivator. Additionally, take an active interest in their career development. Offering additional training and mentorship can make a significant difference.\n\nIt's also crucial to emphasize a healthy work-life balance. Recognize that your employees have lives outside of work, and respecting this balance can lead to happier, more productive team members. Listening to your employees is equally important. When they feel heard, even if they're voicing complaints, their overall satisfaction and productivity improve.\n\nTreat your subordinates with the same respect you would expect from your superiors. This fosters a positive and respectful work environment.\n\nOn the flip side, avoid behaviors that can demotivate your staff. Disrespecting subordinates, taking credit for their work, losing your temper, unfairly blaming them, and failing to acknowledge good work can all have negative impacts.\n\nBy focusing on these positive strategies and avoiding the negative behaviors, you can create a more motivated and effective team.\n\nBest regards,\nAdrian", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a rapidly developing, becoming a big topic of discussion in recent years. It is a concept that has attracted worldwide attention. Due to the demands for enhanced transparency, CSR started to embrace social, ethical as well as environmental challenges. Today, companies are aware of the social and environmental impacts of international production. It is accepted that Companies should not be only profitable, but also have to promote good value in terms of social responsability.\n\nCSR within multinational companies is seen as a vehicle through which larger, well-known corporations can contribute to the wellbeing of developing countries by operating responsibly in terms of social and environmental issues. In more and more companies, initiatives to improve the lives of employees are multiplying, for example company nurseries, promotion of smart working for a correct work-life balance. \nOn the other hand, there are initiatives that have a significant impact on the environment, such as the use of renewable energy, the abolition of plastic.\n\n\nHowever, in some cases very little is known about the companies’ CSR policies and practices in an international context. As reality shows, most of the larger corporations abuse the CSR and behave unethically and irresponsibly towards both society and the environment. Issues such as unsafe working conditions, unfair payment, gender discrimination, toxic emissions and the hazardous pollution of water and soil have all raised fair allegations by consumers, non-governmental organizations and the larger society.\n\nTo sum up, I believe that CSR should be an innate part of business operations, based on transparent values. Only in this way stakeholders and customers can trust the company.\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: Leadership qualities can be developed through practice, self-awareness, and learning from others. From my own experience, one of the most important leadership traits is effective communication. For example, when I was assigned to lead a group project, I learned that clearly expressing ideas and listening to my team’s input helped us work better together. Another key quality is empathy. Leaders who understand and care about others’ perspectives build trust and create a positive environment.\n\nI’ve also observed that confidence and decisiveness play a big role in leadership. A good leader isn’t afraid to make decisions, even in challenging situations, and they inspire confidence in others. For instance, I once saw a peer confidently take charge during a school event when things weren’t going as planned, and their calm approach motivated everyone to adapt quickly.\n\nI believe everyone has the potential to be a leader because leadership isn’t just about having authority—it’s about influencing and guiding others in positive ways.

With a $4 million investment, Zen aims to tap into the growing trend of weekend getaways and increasing consumer focus on health and wellness, as identified by market research from AccomData Group. Unlike traditional fitness centers, which often offer unsatisfying cuisine, Zen will feature a healthy, gourmet menu crafted by top chefs from renowned restaurants. The hotel will also boast fully equipped gyms, swimming pools, and professional instructors to enhance the guest experience. Construction is estimated to take two years, with return on investment anticipated in the second year of operations. By the fifth year from opening, annual profits are projected at $1 million.\n\nRisk Assessment\nAll financial projections include considerations for potential economic downturns. In the event of a stable or growing economy, the timeline for recouping the initial investment and achieving profitability could be reduced by half. Additionally, a robust media campaign managed by Kudos Advertising Agency will help establish a strong market presence, further mitigating risks and accelerating brand recognition.", "task_id": "0efc8863-e086-4c4a-aa14-7f688dec4cb3", "level_title": "Correspondence", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Hi Leon,\nI’m really sorry to hear how stressed you’ve been feeling lately. It seems like your work situation is causing you a lot of stress, especially with the new management. It’s really frustrating to feel like your hard work isn’t being recognized. If you haven’t already, it might help to claim your space by having an open conversation with them about the lack of acknowledgment. Sometimes, a small change in communication can provide relief, but if things don’t improve, consider whether staying there long-term is worth it. Your well-being should come first. \nAs for Tia, it’s painful when relationships go through a rough patch, especially when you thought things were going well. Maybe taking a breather to reflect on what both of you want could help. If you decide to talk to her, try to do it calmly and honestly. These kinds of disputes are often resolved with understanding, though sometimes, if it doesn’t work out, a difficult decision like a breakup or divorce might be the best option for both of you.\nTake care of yourself during this time. Dealing with work and personal issues can feel like a chronic battle, but you don’t have to face it alone. In the short term, you might try taking a walk in the countryside to help you stop thinking about it.\nI’m always here if you need someone to talk to.\n\nTake care,\nCristina", "task_id": "9032f3ed-5da1-4efe-b4dd-c9470bb35d65", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) means that businesses take responsibility for the impact they have on society and the environment. This includes things like helping local communities, protecting the environment, and treating employees fairly. Many businesses today focus on CSR because it can improve their reputation, attract customers, and show that they care about more than just making money.\n\nOne reason CSR is important is that businesses should help solve problems like pollution, poverty, and inequality. For example, companies that use renewable energy or support education programs are helping the world in a positive way. This shows that they care about the future, not just profits.\n\nHowever, some people argue that some companies only pretend to care about these issues for marketing purposes. This is called “greenwashing,” and it happens when companies make themselves look better without really making a difference. To avoid this, CSR efforts need to be real and part of the company’s daily practices, not just a way to improve their image.\n\nIn conclusion, CSR should be a key part of a company’s goals. When businesses focus on giving back to society, they can build trust, grow their customer base, and succeed in the long run.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Include an introduction, a body (with signposting phrases, where possible), an anecdote and a call to action. Write 150–250 words. [SEP] Response: First of all I want to like to say a warm welcome to all of you. My name Is Bill Frisko and I’m the CEO and owner of Frisko Shipping. During this time together I will tell  you the reason to why I started this company, then I will talk about were we as a company are today and I’ll end this presentation talking about your roll as part of this company.\n\nFirst I’d like to make a small quiz, does anyone of you know in how many cities Frisko shipping are located in?.... great, that’s correct we are located in 20 cities all over the world. And how may colleagues will you have now that you will be a part of this company…. Cloes, we have more than 5 000 employees.\n\nMoving along I’d like to tell you a personal story that came to be the foundation to why I started my own shipping company. It was a sunny warm day. I was enjoying the peace and quietness onboard my boat on the open sea when suddenly I felt something hitting the boat. I stood up to see what I could have hit. As I moved along the side of the boat something once again hit the boat making me lose my balance falling overboard into the water. After swimming back to the surface I saw a shadow approaching from the side and before I had time to react a  big shark bit my leg. From nowhere  I remembered a documentary I’d seen on tv that sharks are really sensitive on their nose so without thinking I aimed a punch and managed to hit it so it let go. I have no clue how I did it but somehow I managed to get back on the boat. I was bleeding a lot and was quite far out to sea, I knew there were no way I’d manage to drive the boat back by myself. In the distance I could see a ship so I tore my T-shirt and put it on my fishing pole and started waiving it in the air. Luckily the captain saw my homemade flag and steered  towards me and my boat. After they arrived at my location they helped me up on their ship and gave me medical attention until we reached the closest town. If that ship hadn’t been there and the captain hadn’t noticed me I wouldn’t be here today.  Two years later in 2001 I founded Frisko Shipping. Last year we made 5 million dollars in profit and had 10 percent of the global market shares. \nFinally I’d like to talk about my expectations of you as my employees.  For me this is more then a company, it’s a family and I want you to like working here. I also want all of you to think about what you as individuals can do to contribute in your new roles and at the same time keep being motivated and enthusiastic.\n\nDoes anyone has any questions?\n\nIf not I’d would once again take this opportunity to welcome you to Frisko Shipping.\n", "task_id": "5c89b5ef-f9e4-44c0-bd77-31ed1d856ff0", "level_title": "Presentations", "label": 3}

[SEP] Response: Assessing the Potential for Oil Extraction in the Alberta Oil Fields\n\nAlberta's oil sands hold substantial bitumen reserves, offering significant potential for oil extraction. The estimated operating costs range from $6 to $14 per barrel for bitumen and $18 to $22 per barrel for synthetic crude. The supply costs are higher, ranging from $14 to $24 per barrel for bitumen and $36 to $40 per barrel for synthetic crude. These figures indicate that while extraction is feasible, careful cost management is crucial.\n\nProduction is expected to rise substantially, with total oil supply projected to reach 3.9 million barrels per day by 2015. This increase will require expanding existing markets and identifying new ones to accommodate the surplus supply.\n\nConclusion: Alberta's oil fields present significant growth opportunities, but successful extraction and marketing depend on cost efficiency and market expansion.\n\nRecommendations: Continuous monitoring of crude oil prices is vital. Additional data on transportation and labor costs should be gathered, and preliminary testing should begin to identify operational efficiencies and challenges.\n", "task_id": "b99c403f-3a8e-4397-a157-2644d1952584", "level_title": "Oil and Gas Industry", "label": 5}

This design has an undeniable boldness to it that will set us apart. The sleek, minimal lines combined with vibrant color accents will grab attention without overwhelming the viewer. It’s futuristic, but also versatile enough to evolve over the next year. By focusing on simplicity and strong visuals, we’re ensuring that the design remains timeless, adaptable, and memorable.\n\nIn addition, Design 1 allows us to clearly highlight key features, which is essential for both product showcases and user-centric interactions. It’s user-friendly, with ample whitespace that promotes intuitive navigation, and we’ll be able to scale it across various mediums from print to digital, giving us greater reach.\n\nLet’s also think about the user experience. With its clean layout, it caters to a wide demographic, making it accessible and appealing to both new users and long-time fans of our brand.\"\n\n2. Design 2: The Sophisticated Option\n\"Now, Design 2 has a certain sophistication and elegance to it that could really elevate the brand's status next year. The use of premium textures and refined typography tells a story of quality and exclusivity. This design exudes luxury, making it perfect for high-end product launches or special editions. It’s a bit more subtle, which could be ideal for conveying a premium or professional feel.\n\nHowever, we need to be cautious about the long-term sustainability of the design. While it could work wonders initially, we have to think about how it will evolve. If we don’t adapt it subtly over time, there’s a risk it could feel dated.

Other prominent figures include Nandi, Lord Shiva's bull-headed mount and guardian of Kailash, and the Makara, a mythical sea creature with diverse animalistic features often depicted guarding sacred spaces.

In healthcare, robotic surgery and automated diagnostic tools are improving patient outcomes. Agricultural robots are helping farmers with planting, monitoring crops, and harvesting, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing labor costs. Domestically, robots are becoming common in households for cleaning and security purposes. While I don’t have feelings, I understand that the use of robots can evoke mixed emotions. On the positive side, robots can significantly boost productivity, improve safety, and perform repetitive or dangerous tasks, freeing humans for more creative and strategic roles.

{"text": "Prompt Level: Banking and Finance [SEP] Prompt: You are a journalist for a financial magazine. You've been asked by your editor to write a report on the performance of the Hang Seng (HSI) stock market index. You have some notes and a graph as your guide. Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: Steady Surge: Hang Seng Index Rises on Mainland Momentum\n\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI) has enjoyed a strong upward trend over the past six months, buoyed by growing investment from Mainland China. After dipping to 20,956 half a year ago, the HSI rebounded sharply, reaching a recent high of 27,499 — a significant gain that has caught the attention of investors across Asia.\n\nMuch of this growth can be attributed to impressive performances in the Properties and Utilities sub-indices. As China’s economy continues to expand, its ripple effects have boosted Hong Kong-based companies in these sectors. Analysts point to both the influx of capital from the mainland and rising domestic demand within Hong Kong as key drivers of this rally.\n\nLooking ahead, market experts remain optimistic. With global investors increasingly turning their eyes toward Asia, and local consumption remaining strong, many predict the Hang Seng will continue its upward trajectory into the next year. For now, confidence in the index appears solid, with investors eager to ride the wave of sustained momentum.", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 5}

The paper was brittle, and the ink had smudged in places, but there was no mistaking the symbol of a compass in the corner—a symbol she'd seen before in her grandmother's stories about treasure hunts.\n\nIntrigued, Emma showed it to me, and we started to piece together the strange markings. They seemed to point toward a hidden location in a nearby park. Naturally, we had to investigate. Armed with only the map, a flashlight, and some snacks, we ventured out at dusk. As we neared the marked spot, we found an old stone bench under a giant oak tree. Beneath it, buried under a pile of leaves, was a small, rusty tin box. Inside? A collection of vintage coins from the 1800s.\n\nIt was the kind of discovery that felt like magic, and Emma’s face was priceless when she realized she'd just unlocked a piece of history.", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

They are known to control water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, and seas, and are often associated with rain and fertility. In many stories, Nagas are depicted as benevolent beings who protect humans and bestow blessings. However, they can also be fierce and vengeful if disrespected or provoked.\n\nThe worship of Nagas is prevalent in many parts of India, especially during the festival of Nag Panchami, where devotees offer milk and prayers to snake idols. This ritual is believed to bring prosperity and protection from snake bites.\n\nThe Naga's dual nature as both protector and potential threat adds to its mystique, making it a captivating figure in Indian folklore.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The whole concept of celebrity is a frustrating paradox that often rewards shallow qualities at the expense of meaningful talent or real-world contribution. Celebrities, especially in the entertainment industry, are frequently elevated for their looks or social media following, rather than any substantial ability. This creates a distorted image of success, one that values superficiality over intellect, integrity, or creativity. Take, for instance, a celebrity like Kim Kardashian. While she has undeniably built an empire, much of her fame comes from her family's reality television show and viral moments, rather than groundbreaking work in her field. Instead of being celebrated for extraordinary achievements, she is often heralded simply because her name is known, leading to the troubling idea that fame itself is enough.\n\nFurthermore, celebrities have immense influence on culture, yet many squander it by promoting products or lifestyles that contribute little to genuine progress or social awareness. It’s disheartening to see that, in many cases, being famous is less about talent or effort and more about exploiting the masses’ fascination with wealth and status. The result is a society where merit is often overshadowed by the cult of celebrity.\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Nothing special, just a warm corner with a view of the street and the smell of fresh coffee.\n\nShe sat down, ordered a cappuccino, and started reading a book she’d like to finish for weeks. That’s when she noticed the man at the next table. Mid-60s, drawing something quietly in a notebook. When Carla glanced over again, he smiled and turned the pad toward her. It was a portrait—of her.\n\nThey ended up talking for almost an hour. He turned out to be a retired illustrator from Brazil, traveling solo and drawing people he met along the way. Carla walked away not just with a beautiful sketch, but with a renewed belief that magic still happens, especially when we least expect it.\n\nSometimes the rain really brings good things.\n", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

She had gone on a solo hike in the Lakewood Forest, a peaceful place known for its quiet trails and occasional deer sightings. About halfway through her hike, Lila spotted an old stone well she swore hadn’t been there before. Curious, she walked up to it and looked inside—expecting darkness or maybe some water. Instead, she saw what looked like a flickering campfire deep below, and she heard faint music, like a violin playing an old tune.\n\nBefore she could react, a gust of wind blew through the trees, and a folded piece of parchment flew out of the well, landing at her feet. It had no writing, just a strange symbol: a key inside a circle. When she looked back into the well, everything was gone—no fire, no music. Just darkness.\n\nLila hiked back, feeling uneasy but strangely thrilled. She still has the parchment and is determined to find out what the symbol means. Was it a prank? A portal? We don’t know—but it’s a mystery worth chasing.\n", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

In the past, traditional media such as newspapers, radio, and television were the primary sources of information and entertainment. People relied on daily newspapers for news updates, while radio and TV provided a mix of news, music, and shows. However, with the advent of the internet and digital technology, the landscape has shifted dramatically. Today, digital media platforms like social media, news websites, and streaming services dominate. I now use my smartphone and computer to access news, watch videos, and read articles. This shift has made information more accessible and instantaneous, allowing me to stay updated in real-time. My reading habits have also changed: I now prefer short, concise articles and videos over lengthy newspaper articles. The convenience of digital media has made it easier to consume content on the go, but it has also led to a preference for quick, bite-sized information.", "task_id": "7e0827d0-955c-484a-8c4f-81fe6a574af8", "level_title": "11-Upper Intermediate", "label": 5}

In the past, traditional forms like newspapers, television, and radio were the primary sources of information and entertainment. People would sit down to watch the evening news, listen to radio broadcasts, or read the daily paper to stay informed. However, with the advent of the internet, especially social media platforms, these once-dominant forms of media have seen a decline in influence. Today, I primarily consume news and entertainment through digital platforms, including websites, podcasts, and social media. This shift has not only changed how I access information but also how I interact with it. I no longer read long articles in print; instead, I skim headlines, watch short video clips, and scroll through feeds on my phone. This has made my reading habits more fragmented and fast-paced; I often find it harder to focus on lengthy content. While digital media offers convenience and instant access, it has also impacted my ability to engage deeply with more comprehensive material.", "task_id": "7e0827d0-955c-484a-8c4f-81fe6a574af8", "level_title": "11-Upper Intermediate", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning is an exciting journey, but students often face several challenges along the way. One major hurdle is pronunciation—many learners struggle to produce unfamiliar sounds that don’t exist in their native language. This can make speaking and understanding difficult. Another common issue is grammar complexity, where sentence structures differ vastly across languages, leading to confusion and errors.\nStudents also experience vocabulary retention difficulties, as memorizing new words and their meanings requires consistent practice. The fear of making mistakes often causes a lack of confidence, discouraging learners from speaking in real-world situations. Additionally, immersion challenges arise when students don’t have enough exposure to native speakers, making fluency harder to achieve.\nExternal factors, like limited time for practice or lack of resources, further hinder progress. Without a structured learning approach, students may feel overwhelmed and struggle to stay motivated.\nDespite these obstacles, success is possible! Consistent practice, engaging with native speakers, and using language apps can all accelerate learning. Overcoming self-doubt and embracing mistakes as part of the process is key. After all, learning a language isn’t just about rules—it’s about connection.\nWhat strategies have worked for you in language learning?", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: An airplane is made up of several key parts, each with a specific role. The fuselage is the main body of the aircraft, where the crew, passengers and cargo are carried. It connects all the other parts of the plane together. The wings are crucial for flight, as they generate lift when air flows over them, allowing the plane to stay in the sky. Attached to the back of the fuselage is the tail, which has two important sections: the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. These help keep the airplane stable and allow the pilot to control its direction, preventing unwanted movements like tilting or yawing. The engines provide the thrust needed to propel the plane forward. Most airplanes use jet engines, which push air out at high speed, creating the forward motion required for flight. Together, these parts ensure that the plane can fly safely, efficiently, and in the right direction.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: How would it look if the American flag were combined with the flags of Canada and Mexico? \nShould it be the American flag with two additional stars, or should it include the Canadian maple leaf and the eagle on a cactus eating a snake as part of the design (as small icons)? I can imagine it could be divided into three equal parts to symbolize that each party has the same rights and obligations. \n\nTo clarify, this is about the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the US, Canada, and Mexico. After years of negotiation, it came into force in January 1994.\nIt's hard to remember, but before NAFTA, the countries had different tariffs for various goods to protect their domestic industries. Imagine how much effort it must have taken to transport goods across borders without smartphones and advanced computers—lots of paperwork and signing. After forming the market, NAFTA reduced the amount of customs duties among the members. It has had a profound effect on trade relations, especially in agriculture; for example, Mexican fruits and vegetables flow into the US.\n\nAs a matter of fact, there are both positive and negative impacts on the members. \nBefore NAFTA, Mexico was a self-sufficient country, but now it is flooded with US agricultural products and meat, which are cheaper than domestic products. Smaller Mexican domestic agriculture companies have had to close under the cost pressure. Canada is now a major exporter of raw materials but has to fight against environmental exploitation. Completely different in US, for labor cost reduction were jobs relocated from the US to Mexico. \n\nHowever, I believe they need to address the problems in the right order to save small producers and ensure overall benefits for all members.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Law [SEP] Prompt: Rewrite the termination section of the contract to take into account possible discrimination either against or by the employer or employee. Compare your amendment with the model. This is a non-graded activity. [SEP] Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.", "task_id": "c2b11467-88a4-414c-b759-f88079c5b4d5", "level_title": "Law", "label": 0}

Kyoto is renowned for its well-preserved temples, traditional tea houses, and beautiful gardens. The city exudes a sense of tranquility, with its narrow streets and wooden machiya houses. Kyoto's cultural heritage is evident in landmarks like the Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion) and Fushimi Inari Shrine, where thousands of torii gates create a mesmerizing pathway. Unlike Tokyo's fast-paced lifestyle, Kyoto invites you to slow down and appreciate the beauty of nature and history. The city's seasonal festivals, such as cherry blossom viewing in spring and autumn leaf viewing, highlight its deep connection to the natural world.\n\nWhile Tokyo dazzles with its modernity and vibrant energy, Kyoto captivates with its historical charm and peaceful ambiance.

While talent and intelligence can open doors, discipline is what keeps those doors open. Discipline means having the ability to stay committed to your goals even when motivation fades. It’s waking up early to study, even when you feel tired. It’s choosing long-term rewards over short-term pleasures. Many successful people will tell you that their achievements didn’t come from moments of inspiration alone, but from small, disciplined actions repeated every single day.\n\nDiscipline also teaches you resilience. Life will present challenges, setbacks, and failures, but those who remain disciplined are better prepared to face them. They don’t give up after one failure—they learn from it, adjust their path, and keep moving forward. Ultimately, success is built not on luck, but on steady effort. With discipline, anything becomes possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 0}

Free thinking gives the writer the freedom to explore their ideas and thoughts without the bounds of restrictions. It gives the writer the liberation from rules and norms and helps them freely gather their ideas which helps in creating unique masterpieces.\n\nListing is a technique that could be more useful for people who are more inclined towards their logical thinking rather than creative thinking.

It is more useful in cases of problem solving, new idea generation or suggestion-making for an improvement of an existing condition or situation.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}

It aimed to reduce or eliminate customs duties among the three countries, facilitating the free movement of goods and services across borders.\n\nNAFTA had a profound impact on trade relations, particularly in industries such as agriculture. For example, Mexican fruits and vegetables gained easier access to the U.S. market, increasing trade volume and providing American consumers with more affordable produce. Similarly, American and Canadian companies benefited from expanded export opportunities in various sectors, such as manufacturing and automotive industries.\n\nDespite its advantages, NAFTA also had drawbacks. Some American and Canadian workers lost jobs due to increased competition from Mexican industries, where labor costs were lower. However, the agreement contributed to economic growth in all three nations. Overall, NAFTA played a crucial role in strengthening North American trade and economic integration.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find focused free writing and questioning the most useful. Focused free writing allows me to channel my thoughts in a structured yet creative way. By concentrating on a single topic, I can delve deeper into my ideas without the distraction of unrelated tangents. This technique helps me overcome writer’s block and often leads to unexpected insights that improve the depth of my work. It’s especially effective when exploring complex subjects or drafting the initial stages of an essay.\n\nOn the other hand, questioning is a technique that encourages curiosity and critical thinking. By asking \"why,\" \"how,\" and \"what if\" questions, I can examine a topic from multiple perspectives, uncovering hidden layers of meaning. This method enhances my analytical skills and ensures that my writing addresses potential questions a reader might have, making it more engaging and comprehensive.\n\nThese techniques complement each other well; focused free writing generates raw ideas, while questioning refines and organizes them into coherent, impactful content.

It all started when he decided to take a spontaneous road trip to the countryside. Armed with nothing but his camera and a sense of curiosity, Arjun set off early in the morning, hoping to capture some stunning landscapes.\n\nAs he drove through winding roads and picturesque villages, he stumbled upon an old, abandoned mansion hidden behind a dense grove of trees. Intrigued, Arjun parked his car and decided to explore. The mansion, though dilapidated, had an eerie charm that beckoned him inside.\n\nTo his surprise, Arjun discovered a hidden room filled with antique furniture, dusty books, and a mysterious locked chest. After some effort, he managed to open the chest and found a collection of vintage photographs and letters dating back to the early 1900s. The letters revealed a long-lost love story between the mansion's original owners, adding a touch of romance to his adventure.\n\nArjun spent the rest of the day documenting his findings and imagining the lives of the people who once lived there. By the time he left, the sun was setting, casting a golden glow over the mansion. It was a day he would never forget, and one that reminded him of the magic that can be found in unexpected places.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this fictional tale!

{"text": "Prompt Level: Aviation [SEP] Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane consists of several key parts that work together to ensure it can fly safely and efficiently. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane, providing space for passengers, cargo, and the cockpit where the pilots control the aircraft. It also serves as a structural frame that holds the other parts in place.\n\nThe wings are crucial for flight. They generate lift by moving air faster over the top surface than the bottom, creating an upward force that allows the plane to stay in the air. The shape and angle of the wings are carefully designed to provide the most efficient lift.\n\nThe tail of the airplane, also known as the empennage, consists of the horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer helps to keep the plane level and prevent pitching, while the vertical stabilizer controls the plane’s yaw, or side-to-side movement.\n\nFinally, the engines provide the thrust needed for the airplane to move forward. Most commercial airplanes use jet engines that take in air, compress it, mix it with fuel, and then expel it at high speed to propel the aircraft forward.\n\nEach of these parts works together to ensure the airplane can fly smoothly and safely.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 15-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learners often encounter a range of challenges, which can vary based on their background, the language being learned, and learning contexts. Pronunciation and accents pose significant hurdles, as learners struggle with unfamiliar sounds not present in their native language, making it difficult to understand and be understood by native speakers. Vocabulary acquisition is another common issue, with students finding it tough to remember and accurately use new words, especially when they resemble words in their native language (false cognates).\n\nGrammar and syntax present further difficulties, as each language has unique rules that can differ greatly from the learner's native tongue. Listening comprehension is also a challenge, with fast speech, dialects, and idiomatic expressions often hindering understanding of real-time conversations. Speaking confidence is frequently undermined by anxiety about making mistakes, leading to reluctance in verbal communication.\n\nCultural nuances are another layer of complexity, as language is intertwined with culture, requiring learners to grasp cultural references and social norms. Additionally, maintaining motivation and persistence is crucial yet challenging, as language learning is a long-term commitment. Limited access to quality resources and the need to balance language study with other responsibilities further complicate the learning process. Lastly, language interference from one's native language can lead to errors, necessitating strategies to minimize these issues and enhance language proficiency.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

One key issue is that employees are uncomfortable attending mixed-branch sessions, which may be affecting participation and motivation.\n\nOn the other hand, while Skills Pro is more expensive and has been described by some as offering challenging course content, completion rates are high. This suggests that although the courses are demanding, they are also effective.

The first stage of the fligh was being developed as usually, when suddenly the cockpit indicator in relation with the nose gear started to flash. Immediately, the first officer notified the issue to the captain and informed via radio to the air traffic control service in charge of the flight course monitoring, as well as to the flight attendants. Despite the flight was being coursed in totally normal conditions and there were enough fuel to get to Phoenix, the crew noticed some strange sounds from the lower exterior part of the fuselage. Consequently, the captain, after being advised by the en-route air traffic controllers, decided to deviate from the route initially scheduled and approach San Francisco International Airport (California), where there were the key elements in case of an emergency landing. \nAfter having performed an approach to the airport´s control tower, the controllers and other traffic in the vicinities informed the captain about the problem they were facing. The aircraft´s nose gear wheels were cocked at 90 degrees to the left side. Once the issure was confirmed, the captain decided to land at San Francisco, and told the crew to inform the passenger, and to be prepared for an emergency landing and a rear evacuation of the plane. \nHowever, due to the captain´s expertise and capabilities, he/she was able to touch down successfully, after having burned some fuel gallons while performing holding patterns near the airport.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: The debate on whether companies have a responsibility to society or solely to their shareholders is a critical conversation in today's business landscape. Advocates for corporate social responsibility (CSR) argue that companies, as influential members of society, have an obligation to contribute positively to the communities and environments they impact. On the other hand, critics assert that a company's primary duty lies in maximizing shareholder value.\n\nFor CSR\nProponents emphasize the mutual relationship between corporations and the societies in which they operate. As lil@213 points out, businesses thrive because communities provide them the infrastructure and workforce needed to function. Therefore, giving back through sustainable practices, fair wages, and community support is both ethical and strategic. Jack@MSU highlights that CSR is not just altruistic—it often leads to consumer loyalty, which directly benefits the bottom line. Customers increasingly favor businesses that demonstrate responsibility, creating a win-win situation for corporations and society alike. CSR also fosters goodwill, reduces risks, and ensures long-term sustainability, aligning business operations with societal expectations.\n\nAgainst CSR\nConversely, critics argue that CSR distracts from a company's core mission: profit generation. theG8T echoes Milton Friedman's perspective that businesses exist to serve shareholders, not society. Forcing corporations to engage in CSR may lead to inefficiencies, with resources diverted away from profitable ventures. JackD_92 critiques CSR initiatives as token efforts, often more about public image than meaningful change. Additionally, patty925 argues that social welfare should remain the government's responsibility, ensuring fairness through legislation rather than leaving it to corporate discretion.\n\nConclusion\nUltimately, the role of companies in society depends on one's philosophical stance. While CSR can drive long-term value and social good, it also raises questions about the boundaries of corporate responsibility and the balance between ethical obligations and shareholder priorities.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Step 1: Assess your loan eligibility\nBegin by evaluating whether you meet the lender’s basic eligibility requirements. These typically include your age, income, employment stability, credit score, and existing financial obligations. Most lenders prefer applicants with a steady source of income and a good repayment track record. A credit score of 750 or above is considered favourable. Assessing these parameters in advance helps you determine your borrowing capacity.\n\nStep 2: Decide the loan amount and tenure\nOnce you know you are eligible, evaluate how much you need to borrow. This should be based on the property value, available savings, and the EMI you can manage comfortably. Choosing the right tenor is essential. A longer tenure reduces your EMIs but may increase overall interest costs, while a shorter tenure results in higher EMIs but lower interest outgo.\nPlayUnmute\nFullscreen\n\n\nTo simplify this calculation, you can use a Home Loan Eligibility Calculator by Bajaj Housing Finance Limited. Based on your date of birth, city of residence, monthly income and obligation, the calculator provides an approximate loan amount you can borrow.\n\nStep 3: Compare home loan rates in India\nBefore selecting a lender, compare home loan rates in India offered across financial institutions. Look for not just the lowest home loan rates, but also check:\nProcessing fees and associated charges\nRepayment flexibility\nPost-disbursement customer support\nTransparency of terms and conditions\nStep 4: Fill out and submit your application\nOnce you have selected your preferred lender, proceed to fill out the home loan application either online or by visiting a branch. You can choose to apply online with Bajaj Housing Finance Limited by submitting a simple home loan application form. After submission, a representative will connect with you within 24 hours* to guide you through the next steps.\n\nStep 5: Submit home loan documents\nProper documentation is essential for smooth and timely loan approval. Though documentation requirements vary among lenders, the common documents include:\n\nIdentity and age proof: PAN Card or Form 60 (mandatory), Aadhaar Card, Passport, Voter ID, and Driving licence\nAddress proof: Recent utility bills, Passport, and Aadhaar Card\nIncome proof: Latest salary slips, Form 16 or ITR, Bank statements (for salaried applicants), ITRs, audited financial statements, and business registration proof (for self-employed applicants)\nProperty documents: Sale agreement or builder allotment letter, Title deeds, property registration receipt, NOC, and approved building plan.\nStep 6: Application review and sanction\nThe lender will review your application, verify your documents, and assess your credit profile. If approved, you will receive a sanction letter stating the approved loan amount, tenure, interest type and rate, repayment structure, and terms and conditions.\n\nStep 7: Property verification and legal due diligence\nBefore disbursing the loan, the lender conducts a thorough verification of the property. This includes legal checks of ownership and title, a review of approvals and compliance documents, and technical valuation.\n\nStep 8: Loan disbursement\nFollowing successful verification and agreement, the loan is disbursed. Disbursement may happen in one go (for ready-to-move homes) or in phases (for under-construction properties), based on the payment schedule. Bajaj Housing Finance Limited offers quick disbursal within 48 hours* post document verification and approval.\n\nStep 9: Repayment begins\nYour home loan EMIs begin based on the disbursed amount and the agreed schedule. Paying EMIs on time without defaulting can help you improve your credit score and avoid late penalties.\n\nBefore finalising your loan, it is advisable to use a home loan EMI calculator to estimate your monthly repayments. Planning in advance with the help of an EMI calculator helps you make an informed borrowing decision", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Report on Recommended Training Company: Skills Pro\n\nAfter a thorough evaluation of potential training companies, we recommend Skills Pro for our employee development needs. Although Skills Pro commands a higher price point, its superior quality and effective outcomes justify this investment.\n\nWe assessed two contenders: TrainQuick and Skills Pro. TrainQuick, while economical and flexible, has not gained traction in our other branches. Feedback indicates that employees are uncomfortable when classes are mixed with participants from other locations, which detracts from the learning experience. Consequently, its utilization has been minimal, suggesting it may not meet our training objectives effectively.\n\nIn contrast, Skills Pro offers robust and comprehensive course content that, although challenging, has resulted in high completion rates among participants. The difficulty level ensures thorough mastery of skills, enhancing employee competencies significantly upon course completion. Furthermore, Skills Pro is poised for expansion, potentially offering even more tailored and diverse courses in the near future.\n\nWhile the expense of Skills Pro exceeds that of TrainQuick, the investment in quality training is invaluable. Enhancing employee skills effectively will drive performance and contribute positively to our organizational goals. We recommend proceeding with Skills Pro as our designated training partner.\n\nFeedback on the progress will be accessible within 72 hours for all applicable courses.\n\n", "task_id": "28757296-8797-428f-a562-0b03c304b341", "level_title": "14-Advanced", "label": 5}

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In India, robots are increasingly being integrated into sectors like healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and customer service. Hospitals are using robotic surgical systems for precision procedures, while drones and robotic harvesters assist farmers in monitoring crops and boosting productivity. In urban centers, robots greet customers at banks, hotels, and airports, offering multilingual support and streamlined services. This technological leap brings a mix of optimism and curiosity. On the positive side, robots can handle repetitive or dangerous tasks, freeing humans to focus on creative and strategic work. They improve efficiency, reduce human error, and can even make services more accessible in remote areas. However, there's a flipside—automation may displace jobs, especially in industries reliant on manual labor. It also raises ethical concerns around data privacy and surveillance. Personally, I view robots as powerful tools, not threats. Their impact depends on how responsibly we design and deploy them.

When the communities allows and gives  to the corporations to set up their business its the joint responsibility of all to equally contribute towards the  socities wellness and growth.\n\nThe main motive of the corporations should not be profit maximisation or wealth maximisation by tampering the environment.

Its a two way street, communities allowing to gain the profits of entities and entities contributing for the community.\n\nWhen the corpoartions performs their duty well they get positive feedback from customersand for any business customers are the king. So when the corporation positively contributes they gain customer loyalty. Although one corporation cannot make a huge difference to the society as they cannot take care of the entire society, the collective effort of the mulitple corporation together makes a huge impact towards the society. When everyone contributes their share and the sume from all those entities are combined the total can be a  huge impact towards the societial problems.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 2}

We forecast a return on your investment starting from Year 4. From Year 4, the forecasted profit will be $1 million per year. We guarantee that within six years, you will have recouped your investment and started realizing a profit.\n \nRisk assessment\nWe've factored any possible economic downturn into our forecasted revenues and profits. Our projected figures have taken any worst-case scenarios into account.

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is made up of different parts, such as the fuselage, wings, tail, and engines.\nThe fuselage is a critical component of an airplane that plays a role in the airplane's performance, safety, and passenger comfort. The size, shape, and materials of the fuselage affect the airplane's speed, maneuverability, and fuel economy. The fuselage includes the cockpit, passenger cabin, and cargo hold.\nThe wings play a critical role in generating lift, which allows the airplane to fly. Wings come in different shapes and sizes, and their design, shape, size, and location determine their use. The wings carry fuel tanks.\nThe tail is the rear part of the airplane, which provides stability and control to the airplane. The tail keeps the airplane balanced and allows the pilot to control the tilt of the airplane during maneuvers.

[SEP] Response: Comparison of New York City and Los Angeles\n\nNew York City and Los Angeles are two of the most iconic cities in the United States, but they offer very different lifestyles. New York City is known for its fast-paced environment and towering skyscrapers. The city is bustling 24/7, and there's always something to do, whether it's exploring Broadway shows, visiting museums, or simply walking through the busy streets. The energy of the city is contagious, and people often rely on public transportation to get around due to the city's compact nature.\n\nIn contrast, Los Angeles presents a more laid-back atmosphere. While it is a major urban hub, its sprawling layout and car-centric culture create a more relaxed vibe compared to New York. The city is famous for its entertainment industry, with Hollywood being the heart of the film and television world. The sunny weather and proximity to beautiful beaches also make Los Angeles a more outdoor-oriented city, with residents enjoying activities like hiking, surfing, or relaxing by the ocean.\n\nWhile New York thrives on its density and constant activity, Los Angeles shines with its open spaces and focus on leisure. Both cities have unique offerings, yet they are polar opposites in terms of pace and lifestyle.", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Many planes also have flaps on the wings that help control speed and direction.\n\nThe tail, also known as the empennage, is located at the back of the airplane. It includes the vertical stabilizer (which helps keep the plane flying straight) and the horizontal stabilizer (which helps control up and down movement). The tail helps the pilot keep the airplane balanced and stable during flight.\n\nFinally, the engines provide the thrust needed to move the airplane forward.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 12-Upper Intermediate [SEP] Prompt: Write about how to develop leadership qualities. You can write about personal experiences or what you have seen happen in others. What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: To be a good leader, certain qualities are very important. First, a leader must have good communication skills, meaning they can explain ideas clearly and listen to others. This helps build trust and understanding among a team. Second, a leader should be confident but also humble. Confidence helps with decision-making, while humility allows a leader to accept mistakes and learn from them.\n\nI once worked with a leader who showed these qualities during a difficult project. We had a tight deadline, and the team was feeling stressed. Our leader stepped in, calmly explaining the situation and giving clear instructions. He also took the time to listen to each team member’s concerns, showing real empathy. When things went wrong, he didn’t blame anyone but helped us find solutions together. His confidence in handling the pressure made us all feel more motivated to do our best.\n\nI believe most people have the potential to be a leader. Leadership skills can be developed over time with practice and experience. Not everyone will become a top leader, but many can take on leadership roles in different situations.

{"text": "Prompt Level: Medical industry [SEP] Prompt: You are a medical resident who writes a blog about the health industry. One of your readers has asked you a question. Read the question, then write a suitable answer. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The journey of a doctor usually begins with studying in medical school, which lasts from 5 to 7 years, where basic sciences are learned and diseases are identified and how to diagnose and treat them. This stage requires a lot of study and commitment, and is often intense.\n\nAfter the first years of theoretical study, the student moves to practical training in hospitals, where he learns how to deal with patients and follow up on medical cases practically. This stage is a major turning point because it requires new skills such as communicating with patients,\n\nAfter graduating from medical school, the doctor begins the residency program, which is a specialized training that may last from 3 to 7 years depending on the specialty. During this period, resident doctors work long hours and may be exposed to great psychological and physical pressure. Here they learn how to treat complex cases and rely on themselves in making medical decisions.\n\nAfter residency, the doctor can choose a specific specialty, and this requires an additional stage known as a fellowship, where he trains in advanced skills in his field of specialization. This stage gives him deep experience and may last for several years.\n\nDuring the years of training, the doctor receives a salary, but it may not be enough compared to the long hours and pressures he is exposed to. However, after completing training, doctors enjoy a distinguished professional status and a stable income, but it varies according to the specialty and the place where they work.\n\n6. Working in a hospital or clinic:\nWorking in hospitals or clinics depends on the specialty, as doctors deal with different cases on a daily basis and treat patients. Each work environment has its challenges, as working in a hospital may be more crowded and require long working hours, while clinics may have more regular working hours.\n\nIn short, the medical profession is a noble profession, but it requires a lot of commitment and dedication to serving others. During their professional journey, the doctor learns to be humble and patient, and is highly appreciated by society, but they must also be prepared to bear the constant pressures of work.

[SEP] Response: Combating Counterfeit Goods\n\nTo effectively combat counterfeiting, the Inspector highlights several actions both companies and the public can take. Companies should invest in secure packaging, unique labeling, and traceable serial numbers to make it harder for counterfeiters to replicate products. They are also encouraged to work closely with customs and law enforcement agencies, sharing information and taking legal action when necessary. Regular training for staff and awareness campaigns can also help detect and prevent counterfeiting.\n\nThe public also plays a vital role. Consumers are urged to buy from reputable retailers and to be cautious of deals that seem too good to be true. Checking labels, packaging quality, and seller reviews can help identify fake goods. The Inspector encourages people to report any suspected counterfeit items to the authorities, as this helps investigations and supports broader efforts to shut down illegal operations.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a concept that has gained significant traction in recent years, reflecting the growing recognition that businesses have a responsibility beyond profit-making. CSR encompasses a range of practices and policies that companies implement to manage their impact on society and the environment. It is rooted in the idea that businesses should contribute positively to the communities in which they operate, addressing social, economic, and environmental issues.\n\nOne of the key aspects of CSR is environmental sustainability. Companies are increasingly adopting eco-friendly practices, such as reducing carbon emissions, minimizing waste, and using renewable energy sources. These efforts not only help protect the planet but also enhance the company's reputation and build trust with consumers who are becoming more environmentally conscious.\n\nAnother important dimension of CSR is social responsibility. This includes initiatives aimed at improving the well-being of employees, supporting local communities, and promoting diversity and inclusion. For example, companies may invest in employee training and development, engage in fair labor practices, and support charitable causes. By doing so, they create a positive work environment and contribute to the social fabric of society.Economic responsibility is also a crucial component of CSR. Businesses can drive economic growth by creating jobs, paying fair wages, and engaging in ethical business practices. This not only benefits the economy but also fosters a sense of loyalty and trust among stakeholders.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Sometimes renting a house can be much beneficial from financial point of view. The rental yield is not pretty high and capital appreciation is also limited. So overall buying a home will not give much returns as a whole. Another concerning point is that the capital gets locked for a considerable period of time.However this is only from the financial point of view. There can be other factors as well. We need to consider the qualitative factors as well. Buying a house an give a person social security. Family parameters should also be taken into consideration. After all the financial and qualitative aspect one comes to a final decision of buying or renting a house. After that comes the decision how to finance it. It is less likely that one uses entire savings to buy a house. Usually one ends up taking a loan. A thorough study and in depth analysis should be taken place so as to decide to obtain it from which financial institution. Special impetus should be given to the fact that the rate of interest is lowest, the financial institution should be trusted and the terms of repayment must be favourable.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}

Use the notes to help you. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: Abstract\nThis study explores the expected impact of the Sun Valley Dam construction on the local sloth population. Using an advanced PC simulation, the research analyzed various factors affecting sloth livelihoods, such as habitat area and food availability. The simulation revealed that the primary threats to the sloth population would stem from habitat loss and a reduction in food variety due to the dam’s construction. These two factors are expected to be the most significant contributors to population decline. In light of these findings, it is recommended to relocate the local sloth species to the neighboring Corona Valley before construction begins to prevent ecological disruption and potential extinction. This proactive measure is crucial to preserving the species in the region.\n", "task_id": "76bba4e9-a91a-49e2-89a6-129b5a013873", "level_title": "Sciences", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 15-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning is a rewarding but often challenging journey. Students frequently face difficulties that range from pronunciation struggles to mastering grammar and vocabulary retention. One common issue is overcoming the fear of making mistakes. Many learners hesitate to speak because they worry about errors, which can hinder their progress. Confidence-building exercises, such as practicing with native speakers or engaging in conversations, help students gain fluency.\n\nAnother challenge is understanding cultural nuances. Language is deeply tied to culture, and learners may struggle with idioms, slang, or expressions that don’t directly translate. Exposure to authentic materials, such as movies, books, and conversations, enhances cultural comprehension.\n\nAdditionally, memorizing vocabulary and grammar rules can be daunting. Rote learning often fails to stick, so students benefit from active learning techniques, such as writing practice, using words in context, and spaced repetition systems.\n\nConsistency is also crucial—many learners start with enthusiasm but struggle with maintaining a regular study schedule. Setting achievable goals and incorporating language learning into daily routines can help sustain progress. \n\nBy addressing these challenges with patience and persistence, students can improve their proficiency and enjoy the process of mastering a new language. Would you like suggestions on effective study strategies?", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language students encounter a variety of issues and challenges that can impede their progress. \n-What are the primary barriers to language learning? \nOne major challenge is maintaining motivation. Language acquisition is a gradual process, and students often feel discouraged by the slow pace of improvement, especially when fluency seems distant. \n-How can students stay motivated? \nSetting realistic goals and acknowledging small successes can help sustain motivation.\n-What role does grammar play in language learning difficulties? \nThe complexity of grammar and syntax poses another significant challenge. Language learners may struggle with new grammatical structures that differ from those in their native language. \n-Why is grammar challenging? \nUnderstanding and applying these structures requires both memorization and practical usage, which can be daunting.\n-How does pronunciation impact language learning? \nPronunciation is another hurdle, with many languages containing unfamiliar sounds. This can lead to misunderstandings and frustration, particularly in verbal communication. \n-What strategies can help with pronunciation? \nRegular practice with native speakers and using language learning apps can improve pronunciation skills.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Maritime [SEP] Prompt: Write a report about a collision between your vessel and a right whale. Use your own ideas. Write 100-150 words. Type in the input box. [SEP] Response: Preventing Ship-Whale Collisions\nPreventing collisions between ships and whales is crucial for marine conservation. A primary method is speed reduction, especially in known whale habitats or during migration seasons. Many maritime organizations recommend vessels travel at 10 knots or less in these areas, as slower speeds give whales more time to react and allow ships to alter course more effectively.\n\nAnother key strategy involves real-time whale detection systems. These can range from trained lookouts scanning the waters to advanced technologies like hydrophones that detect whale vocalizations, or even thermal imaging. Route deviation is also vital; ships should reroute to avoid areas with high whale concentrations whenever possible.\n\nFinally, data sharing and awareness campaigns play a significant role. By sharing whale sighting data and educating mariners on best practices, we can collectively reduce the risk of these unfortunate incidents.", "task_id": "511ccd73-9db8-45e5-8f85-10e244841ce2", "level_title": "Maritime", "label": 5}

Also, treat your coworkers with respect and kindness, avoid getting entangled in negative talks. \nFurther, look to your manager for guidance and mentorship. Since, the mentor can provide insights into navigating office politics while helping you grow professionally. Office politics can be frustrating ,but responding with anger or annoyance won't help.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility is an esential aspect of modern business practices that goes beyond more profit generation. It refers to the commitment of companies to conduct their operations in an ethical manner, considering their impact on society and the environment. Companies that embrace CSR not only enhance their brand reputation but also contribute positively to the communities in which they operate.\nOne of the key arguments for CSR is that it fosters trust between businesses and consumers. In today's world, consumers are increasingly aware of the social and environmental implications of their purchases. They prefer to support companies that demonstrate a commitment to ethical practices, sustainability, and community engagement. This consumer preference can lead to increased loyalty and sales, ultimately benefiting the company's bottom line.\nFurthermore, CSR initiatives can improve employee morale and attract top talent. When employees feel that their company is making a positive impact, they are more likely to be engaged and motivated in their work. This can lead to increased productivity and lower turnover rates.\nIn conclusion, corporate social responsibility is not just a moral obligation; it is a strategic advantage.\nCompanies that prioritize CSR can build stronger relationships with consumers and employees, leading to long-term success and sustainability. It is imperative for businesses to recognize the importance of their role in society and actively engage in practices that promote social good.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The main body of an aircraft is known as the fuselage. It typically has a long, narrow, tubular shape designed to minimize air resistance and enhance aerodynamic efficiency. Inside the fuselage is the cabin, where the flight crew and passengers are accommodated throughout the journey. The landing gear is housed in the lower section of the fuselage and can be retracted after takeoff and deployed again during landing.\n\nExtending from either side of the fuselage are the wings, which are fundamental to generating lift. They are slightly curved—a design feature known as an airfoil—that allows air to move more quickly over the top surface than the bottom, creating the lift necessary for flight. Attached to the rear edge of the wings are flaps, which are hinged control surfaces. When lowered, flaps increase the curvature and surface area of the wing, enhancing lift during critical phases such as takeoff and landing.\n\nThe stability of the aircraft is largely maintained by the tail assembly, located at the rear of the plane. The vertical component of the tail is referred to as the vertical stabilizer or fin, which helps maintain directional stability. Attached to it is the rudder, a movable surface that enables the aircraft to yaw, or turn left and right, during flight.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), signed by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, came into effect in January 1994 after years of negotiation. Its main goal was to reduce or eliminate customs duties between the member countries, promoting economic integration and boosting trade. From a Brazilian perspective, NAFTA served as a significant example of regional cooperation and influenced discussions within Mercosur, the trade bloc Brazil is a part of.\n\nNAFTA had a strong impact on trade flows, particularly in the agricultural sector. For instance, Mexico significantly increased its exports of fruits and vegetables to the U.S. While the agreement brought economic growth and increased trade among members, it also led to challenges such as industrial relocation and labor market shifts.\n\nAlthough Brazil was not a party to NAFTA, it observed its outcomes closely. The agreement highlighted both the opportunities and risks of deep trade liberalization. In comparison, Mercosur has taken a more cautious approach, focusing on gradual integration and protection of local industries. Still, NAFTA's model continues to inform Brazil’s trade policy, especially in negotiations with extra-regional partners.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write back to them about the state of the industry in your country, or internationally, it's up to you. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: \n\nTelecommunications\nTypes of telecommunications companies\nService providers\nThese companies provide local and long-distance wired telephone service, known to industry insiders as POTS – ‘plain old telephone service.’ wired providers include the large long-distance providers. A new generation of companies is laying fiber-optic wire networks to handle the rapidly increasing data traffic.\n\nWireless service providers\nThese companies have made it possible to communicate in the far corners of the earth where there’s no existing wireline infrastructure. Wireless communication uses technologies such as cordless telephones cellular telephones and satellites. Instead of wires and cables, radio waves sent through space are used as the medium for communication. An important characteristic of these companies is high consolidation of carriers and use of partnerships, which allows them to reach wider geographic areas and gain economies of scale.\n\nSatellite telecommunication services\nSatellite telecom services can be separated into fixed satellite services such as INTELSAT; low earth orbit companies (LEOs), which include Iridium and mega-LEO Teledesic; direct-broadcast satellite companies; and the global positioning system (GPS). Satellite services include everything from navigation systems used in automobiles to video broadcast and data transmission.\n\nInternet service providers (ISPs)\nThe internet has become an integral part of the telecommunications industry as voice and data networks converge. ISPs are the companies that make it possible for people to go online. They provide services like internet transit, domain name registration and hosting, software and leased line access and collocation. Recently the stock market for the telecommunications and IT-related industries has seen a downturn, causing many ISPs to face restructuring, takeovers and mergers.\n\nCustomer premise equipment (CPE) manufacturers\nCPE includes telecommunications equipment, such as telephones, fax machines, modems, voicemail systems, private branch exchanges (PBXs) and inside wiring located at a subscriber’s premises and connected with a carrier’s communication channels at the demarcation point. Telecommunication service providers are the main purchasers of telecommunications equipment.\n\nNetworking equipment and fiber optics manufacturers\nNetworking equipment includes the equipment that allows the local area network (LAN) to operate, including routers, hubs, switches and servers. Fiber optics consist of the optical fiber and fiber-optic cable, transmitters, receivers and connectors that carry data and voice messages.\n\nWireless and satellite communication equipment manufacturers\nThese are actually different categories grouped together for convenience, since the equipment for the different sectors is quite distinct. These companies create the hardware necessary for the satellite and wireless communication to take place.", "task_id": "d491686c-8998-4062-bd13-27562deecdbe", "level_title": "Telecommunications", "label": 5}

Make it interesting and descriptive, and remember to check for pronoun reference. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Writing descriptively is a powerful technique that brings scenes, characters, and emotions to life by appealing to the reader’s senses. It goes beyond simply stating facts; it paints vivid pictures through carefully chosen words and details. When writing descriptively, an author might describe not just how a place looks, but how it smells, sounds, feels, or even tastes. For example, instead of saying “The room was messy,” a descriptive writer might say, “Clothes were strewn across the floor, and the scent of old pizza lingered in the air.” This kind of writing allows readers to immerse themselves in the story, visualizing every element as if they were experiencing it themselves. Strong descriptive writing often uses figurative language such as metaphors and similes, as well as precise adjectives and verbs. It requires careful observation and attention to detail. Ultimately, writing descriptively makes narratives more engaging and memorable by helping readers connect emotionally and sensorially with the text.", "task_id": "52a760cd-9898-4cce-bb43-c490923b2b45", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 0}

Fighting broke out for control of the mineral-rich Argos Region, as well as between certain minority groups who were made refugees. There is also evidence of an attempt at ethnic cleansing of a minority group.\n\nSix months ago the military staged a coup to reunite the Federation.

These armies have had small battles between themselves over disputed territories while resisting operations by the Federal forces based in Federal Territory.\n\nUntil a month ago the situation was a stalemate, however, the various factions have been rearming under the pretence of negotiations. Recently, strong leadership in Beta has resulted in a campaign that has pinned down Federal forces and Beta forces have also launched an all-out attack through Alpha territory to seize valuable land in Argos.\n\nThis has resulted in considerable civilian casualties, refugees and dislocation of population.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is not just an ethical obligation but a practical necessity in today's interconnected world. While some argue that a company's sole responsibility is to maximize profits for its shareholders, this view overlooks the long-term benefits of investing in societal and environmental well-being.\nFirst, CSR fosters trust and loyalty among consumers. In a competitive market, companies that demonstrates genuine care for societal issues often attract and retain customers who value ethical practices. This, tur, enhances brand reputation and can lead to increased profitability. As lil@213 pointed out, it's a two-way street-businesses thrive in communities that they support and invest in.\nSecond, CSR initiatives improve employee satisfaction and productivity. Offering fair wages, promoting diversity, and creating sustainable workplaces cultivate a positive work culture, reducing turnover and associated costs. This aligns with Jack@MSU's observation that CSR can contribute directly to a company's bottom line.\nOn the contrary, dismissing CSR as mere marketing, as JackD_92 suggests, undermines its broader impact. While some companies may exploit it superficially, genuine CSR initiatives can address pressing global issues like climate change, inequality, and resource depletion-areas where governments alone often fall short.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

This positive outlook is underpinned by expectations of massive investment inflows from various international markets, alongside robust internal demand within Hong Kong. The current environment strongly suggests a promising outlook for the HSI. \na significant surge in investments originating from Mainland China.\nDespite an initial dip to 20,956", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) iit's an essential aspect of modern business practices. In today's interconnected world, companies are expected not only to deliver financial returns for their shareholders but also to contribute positively to society and the environment. This expectation comes from customers, employees, investors, and the broader public, putting pressure on businesses to adopt meaningful CSR initiatives.\nHowever, CSR should be more than a marketing exercise. Authenticity matters. The most successful CSR programs are those deeply integrated into a company’s mission and operations, with clear goals, consistency, and transparent reporting.\nIn summary, corporate social responsibility is both a moral imperative and a strategic advantage. Businesses that act responsibly help build a more sustainable and equitable society while benefiting themselves through improved reputation and stakeholder trust. Ultimately, a genuine commitment to CSR helps ensure long-term business success in an ever-evolving world\nIn a world where consumers have many choices, CSR can be a distinguishing feature that tips the balance in favor of one company over another. Ultimately, aligning business strategies with social values is not only the right thing to do but also makes smart business sense, fostering a win-win situation for companies, customers, and communities alike.\n\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Finally, they let the five pass winners into the large room where the band members were relaxing. We all just nervously introduced ourselves and chatted about the music for about 10 minutes. Then we were escorted out. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. So amazing!

{"text": "Prompt Level: 15-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning is an enriching yet challenging endeavor that many students embark upon. A primary issue that students often face is the complexity of grammar rules. Each language has its own set of grammatical structures, and these can be intricate and difficult to master. For instance, understanding the correct use of tenses or sentence structures in a new language can be daunting, especially if they differ significantly from those in the learner's native tongue.\n\nAnother challenge is vocabulary acquisition. Expanding one's vocabulary in a new language requires consistent effort and practice. Students might struggle to remember new words, their meanings, and their correct pronunciation. This can be exacerbated by the lack of immediate immersion in a language-speaking environment, which limits practical usage and retention.\n\nPronunciation is also a common hurdle. Different languages have unique sounds that may not exist in a learner's native language, making it difficult to produce these sounds correctly. This can lead to misunderstandings and frustration in communication.\n\nAdditionally, cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions can pose difficulties. Understanding the cultural context behind certain phrases or expressions is crucial for effective communication but can be challenging for those not immersed in the culture.\n\nTo address these challenges, language students can benefit from immersive experiences, such as engaging with native speakers, using language-learning apps, and consuming media in the target language. Consistency and patience are key to overcoming these obstacles and achieving fluency.  ", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Businesses operate within a larger social and environmental ecosystem, and their actions can significantly impact communities and the environment.\nCSR initiatives can enhance a company's reputation, build trust with stakeholders, and contribute to long-term sustainability. Companies can drive positive change and address social and environmental issues through their resources and influence. A company's primary responsibility is to its shareholders:\n 1. The primary goal of a business is to generate profits for its shareholders, who invest in the company with the expectation of financial returns.\n2. CSR initiatives can be seen as secondary to the company's core mission of maximizing shareholder value.\n3. Some argue that companies should focus on their core business and let governments and non-profits handle social and environmental issues.\nSome companies have successfully integrated CSR into their business models, while others have faced criticism for prioritizing profits over social and environmental concerns. \nCSR initiatives can create shared value for both the company and society, driving business success while addressing social and environmental challenges. Companies should be transparent about their CSR initiatives and be held accountable for their impact on society and the environment.\nThese perspectives highlight the complexity of CSR and the need for companies to balance competing interests and priorities.\n\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 4}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: While celebrities often inspire and entertain us, the culture surrounding them can sometimes be problematic. \n\nFirstly, our obsession with celebrities can lead to unhealthy idolization. It's easy to get caught up in their glamorous lives and forget about our own. This can create unrealistic standards of beauty, success, and happiness, making us feel inadequate in comparison.\n\nSecondly, the invasion of privacy is a significant issue. Imagine having every detail of your personal life exposed and sensationalized by the media. This relentless scrutiny can take a toll on celebrities' mental health and sets a dangerous precedent that privacy is a luxury rather than a right.\n\nMoreover, the commercialization of celebrity status can be troubling. Many celebrities endorse products and lifestyles that may not truly reflect their values, driven by financial gain rather than genuine belief. This can mislead fans and promote consumerism, making us buy things we don't really need.\n\nLastly, the disproportionate influence celebrities wield can be concerning. Their opinions on social and political issues often overshadow those of experts, leading to misinformation and skewed public perceptions.\n\nIn conclusion, while celebrities can positively impact society, the culture surrounding them often promotes unhealthy behaviors and values. It's important to keep a balanced perspective and prioritize our own well-being over celebrity worship.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home in India is a significant milestone, but the process can be quite complex and time-consuming. The first step is to determine your budget and preferred location. Housing prices vary widely across the country, with cities like Mumbai and Delhi having some of the highest prices, averaging around INR 26,780 per square foot in Mumbai. Once you've identified a property, the next step is to apply for a home loan.\n\nApplying for a home loan involves several steps, including assessing your eligibility, choosing a lender, and selecting the right loan product. You'll need to fill out an application form and provide various documents such as ID proof, address proof, income statements, and property documents. The lender will then verify your information and conduct a property valuation before approving the loan. Interest rates for home loans in India currently range from 8.35% to 14.50% per annum, depending on the lender and loan amount.\n\nUsing a real estate agent or mortgage broker can be beneficial, especially for first-time buyers. Real estate agents can help you find suitable properties and negotiate prices, while mortgage brokers can assist in finding the best loan deals and navigating the application process. However, their services come at an additional cost. Overall, while buying a home in India can be challenging, proper planning and the right assistance can make the process smoother and more manageable.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: The debate around Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a crucial one, and in my opinion, companies absolutely have a responsibility to society that extends beyond merely maximizing profits for shareholders. While some argue a company's sole duty is to its investors, this perspective feels increasingly outdated. Businesses don't operate in a vacuum; they exist within communities, utilize shared resources, and rely on a healthy society for their workforce and consumer base. This interdependency creates an ethical obligation to contribute positively to the broader good.\n\nBeyond ethical considerations, CSR makes undeniable business sense. Consumers increasingly value and reward companies with strong social and environmental records, fostering loyalty and enhancing brand reputation. Furthermore, a genuine commitment to fair employee benefits and sustainable operations often leads to higher productivity, lower turnover, and a more engaged workforce. While some might view CSR spending as a mere marketing tactic, truly integrated efforts build long-term value and resilience, far surpassing any fleeting PR gains.\n\nUltimately, while governments certainly set regulations, responsible companies go beyond minimum compliance, proactively addressing societal challenges. Integrating social and environmental responsibility into core operations isn't just about doing good; it's about building a more reputable, sustainable, and ultimately more profitable future for all stakeholders involved.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Tell Mr. Richards to consult the itinerary for details of the trip's actiivities. Write no more than 100 words. Compare your text with the model. [SEP] Response: Positive thinking is more than just a mindset—it is a powerful tool that can transform your entire life. When you focus on the good, even in difficult situations, you train your mind to see opportunities instead of obstacles. This simple shift in perspective can improve your mood, relationships, health, and success.\n\nPeople who practice positive thinking are often more resilient. They bounce back from failure faster and learn from their mistakes. They approach challenges with confidence and believe in their ability to grow and improve. This optimism creates a sense of hope that helps them keep moving forward, even when times are tough.\n\nPositive thinking also affects physical health. Studies show that people with a positive outlook are less likely to suffer from stress-related illnesses. They often sleep better, have lower blood pressure, and enjoy better overall well-being.\n\nOf course, staying positive doesn’t mean ignoring reality or pretending that everything is perfect. It means choosing to face life with courage and faith, trusting that things can get better. It involves gratitude, self-compassion, and surrounding yourself with supportive people.\n\nYou can develop positive thinking by practicing daily affirmations, setting realistic goals, and focusing on what you can control. Even small habits like smiling more or writing down things you're thankful for can make a big difference.\n\nIn a world full of negativity and pressure, choosing positivity is a powerful act. It can change your life and inspire those around you. So, no matter where you are in your journey, remember: your thoughts have power. Choose them wisely, and you can create a brighter future—one positive step at a time.", "task_id": "c0729dc9-ae73-4316-8da4-1f705c92e769", "level_title": "Travel Industry", "label": 0}

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In India, robots are increasingly being integrated across various sectors, revolutionizing industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, automobile, hospitality and agriculture. In factories, robots enhance productivity and precision, reducing human error and operational costs in assembly line. In healthcare, robotic surgery and AI-driven diagnostic tools improve the quality of care and patient outcomes. In agriculture, drones and automated machinery help optimize crop management and yield. While these advancements promise enhanced efficiency and economic growth, they also raise concerns about job displacement and the widening skills gap. The reliance on robots could lead to reduced employment opportunities for low-skilled workers, necessitating robust retraining programs. Additionally, the ethical implications of AI and robotics in decision-making processes warrant careful consideration. Overall, while robots have the potential to significantly boost productivity and improve quality of life, they must be integrated thoughtfully to ensure equitable benefits across society and minimize adverse social impacts.", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is not merely a philanthropic endeavor, but a crucial aspect of sustainable and ethical business practices. While some argue that a company's sole responsibility is to maximize shareholder profits, a broader perspective recognizes the interconnectedness of business and society.  Companies benefit significantly from the communities they operate in, utilizing resources, infrastructure, and human capital.  Therefore, a reciprocal relationship is essential.  Investing in local communities, promoting sustainable practices, and ensuring fair labor conditions are not just altruistic acts, but strategic moves that foster long-term growth.\nConsumer behavior further reinforces the importance of CSR.  Increasingly, consumers are conscious of the social and environmental impact of the products and services they purchase.  Companies with strong CSR records build brand loyalty and attract socially conscious customers, ultimately boosting their bottom line.  This demonstrates that CSR is not just an expense, but an investment that can enhance profitability.\nWhile some critics argue that CSR is simply a marketing ploy, or that its impact is negligible compared to overall profits, these arguments miss the point.  Even small CSR initiatives can have a significant positive impact on local communities and raise awareness about important social and environmental issues.  Furthermore, while government regulation plays a vital role in setting minimum standards, corporations have the resources and reach to go beyond these minimums and contribute proactively to societal well-being.  In conclusion, CSR is not just a moral imperative, but a practical necessity for businesses seeking long-term success in an increasingly interconnected world.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Findings indicated that loss of habitat and reduction of food variety will be the primary factors caused by the dam's construction, leading to population decline.

Survey\n\nDefinition: A quantitative research method involving structured questionnaires distributed to a large audience to collect data on opinions, behaviors, or demographics.\n\nPurpose: Used to gather standardized and measurable data that can be analyzed statistically.\n\nStrengths: Efficient for reaching a large population; provides a broad overview of trends and patterns; results are easily quantifiable.\n\nLimitations: Limited depth of insight; potential for response bias if questions are unclear or poorly designed.\n\n3. Interviews\n\nDefinition: A qualitative research method involving one-on-one conversations between a researcher and a participant to gather in-depth information.\n\nPurpose: Used to explore personal experiences, opinions, and motivations in detail.\n\nStrengths: Allows for deep exploration of topics; adaptable to individual responses; builds rapport, encouraging openness.\n\nLimitations: Time-consuming; requires skilled interviewers; prone to interviewer bias and may not represent broader populations.\n\nEach method serves different research needs, with focus groups and interviews providing rich, qualitative insights, while surveys offer a broad, quantitative overview.\n", "task_id": "cdb32f32-8025-46a7-84fd-c887feec3117", "level_title": "Research", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: In India, robots are increasingly being integrated into various sectors, revolutionizing the way tasks are performed. In manufacturing, robots are used for assembly lines, enhancing precision and efficiency. In healthcare, robotic surgery and automated medication dispensing systems are becoming more common, improving patient outcomes. Additionally, robots are employed in agriculture for tasks like planting and harvesting, which helps in addressing labor shortages and increasing productivity.

[SEP] Response: The FDA is responsible for drug regulation in the U.S.\nThe FDA's roles include drug safety and packaging.\nThe FDA is involved in monitoring the sale of proprietory drugs.\nEthical drugs, dispensed by doctors and pharmacists, are monitored by medical personnel.\nUp until the end of the nineteenth century, anyone could sell drugs, without having to prove they actually worked.\nNow, any new drug has to be tested by the FDA before it is released onto the market.\nTHE FDA monitors over-the-counter drugs continually. For example, after it emerged a certain drug was dangerous if taken with alcohol, the FDA ruled that warning labels must be included in the packaging.\nDrug regulation\n\nDrugs can produce harmful effects when manufactured or taken improperly, therefore drug development and availability is under strict government control in most countries\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the government agency responsible for regulating food and medical treatments in the United States. Its responsibilities include ensuring that drugs and therapeutic devices are safe and effective for their intended uses and that labels and packaging of products are truthful and informative.\n\nIn the United States, the FDA determines how drugs are produced and how they are sold Drugs that can be sold over the counter (OTC), without a prescription from a physician, are called proprietary drugs. They are considered safe for unsupervised use by the general public. Drugs that must be prescribed by physicians and dispensed by pharmacists are known as ethical drugs. Their use is monitored closely by medical personnel.\n\nBefore 1900, any individual could sell a drug without providing medical proof of the therapeutic benefits. The first law passed to change this was the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, which required drug manufacturers to state the content, strength and purity of each drug they produced. Legislation passed over the years - such as the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 - stipulated that new drugs be safe for humans, required manufacturers to prove the efficacy of new drugs, and established rules for manufacturing and prescribing habit-forming drugs, particularly those with a high abuse potential Drug manufacturers are required to submit samples of new drugs to FDA laboratories for testing, and their labeling must also be approved before the products are sold.\n\nThe U.S. government and its regulatory agencies continually monitor the development and use of all drugs sold in the United States to ensure that the American public has access only to drugs that are safe and effective. For example, the FDA recently introduced legislation requiring warning labels on all over-the-counter medication after research indicated that the non-aspirin pain reliever acetaminophen can cause liver damage when taken in high doses in combination with large quantities of alcohol.\n\nPharmacy today all rights reserved", "task_id": "d3ead51b-9893-419c-9bbf-4006296fadf9", "level_title": "Pharmacy", "label": 3}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, several stand out as particularly useful. Metaphor and symbolism are invaluable for adding depth and layers of meaning to writing. They allow writers to convey complex ideas and emotions in a more relatable and impactful way. For instance, using a metaphor can transform a mundane description into something vivid and thought-provoking, while symbolism can imbue a narrative with richer significance.\n\nFree writing and focused free writing are excellent for overcoming writer's block and generating raw material. Free writing encourages a flow of ideas without self-censorship, which can lead to unexpected insights and creative breakthroughs. Focused free writing, on the other hand, directs this spontaneous flow towards a specific topic, helping to refine and develop ideas more systematically.\n\nListing and questioning are practical techniques for organizing thoughts and exploring different angles of a topic. Listing helps in brainstorming and structuring content, ensuring that all relevant points are covered. Questioning prompts deeper analysis and critical thinking, pushing the writer to consider various perspectives and details.\n\nCubing is particularly useful for examining a subject from multiple viewpoints, enhancing the depth and breadth of the writing. By looking at a topic through different lenses, writers can develop a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding.\n\nOverall, these techniques collectively enhance creativity, clarity, and depth in writing, making them essential tools for any writer.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

During our last discussion, I clearly informed you that failure to comply with the dress code would result in further action.

Additionally, you have been wearing a sweatshirt, which is not permitted under company policy.\n\nPlease be aware that this serves as your final warning on this matter. If you do not begin complying with the dress code immediately, your employment may be terminated.\n\nI sincerely hope this will not be necessary, so I urge you to take this warning more seriously than ever.\n\nSincerely,\nSusan\n\n", "task_id": "659483c6-62eb-4109-bcb3-08c5a8e01586", "level_title": "Office", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, metaphor, symbolism, and questioning stand out as the most useful to me. Metaphor allows for vivid comparisons that breathe life into writing, helping readers connect abstract ideas to tangible imagery. Symbolism, on the other hand, enriches writing by layering deeper meanings beneath the surface, making narratives more engaging and thought-provoking. These techniques are particularly valuable in creative writing, where emotional depth and layered interpretations enhance storytelling.\nAdditionally, questioning serves as a powerful tool to develop ideas and encourage critical thinking. By asking \"what if\" or \"why,\" writers can push their thoughts further, uncovering fresh perspectives and unexpected angles. This technique is incredibly effective when brainstorming or refining arguments in analytical writing. While free writing and loop writing help generate ideas freely, structured techniques like listing and cubing provide organization, making them useful for planning essays or breaking down complex topics.\nEach technique has its own strengths, but the most effective ones depend on the writing purpose and style.\n", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Insurance [SEP] Prompt: Explain in one sentence the factors which affect the premium of a liability policy. Write the sentence below. Use the text to help you. This is a non-graded activity. [SEP] Response: In the United States, there are seven basic types of home insurance. However, most homes are covered by two types, called Homeowner's 2 (HO-2) and Homeowner's 3 (HO-3). HO-2 covers the residence and personal property against 17 different types of peril, including fire, smoke, windstorm, theft, falling objects, electrical surges and water damage caused by home appliances. HO-3 covers all of the perils in HO-2 and adds all other perils not stated in the policy, excluding flood, earthquake, war and nuclear accident.\n\nThe owner must first determine how much it would cost to replace the house and many of the items inside. Most homeowner policies contain replacement cost coverage on the home and actual cash value coverage on personal property. Many policies also have automatic annual adjustments for inflation. This increases the amount of coverage on the home to keep pace with rising building costs.\n\nLiability coverage is an important part of any home insurance policy. It covers financial liability in case someone unrelated to the insured suffers a serious injury on the property. The general level of liability protection in the United States is $100,000, but many people have coverage of $300,000 or even more. Most policies set limits for items like jewelry, collectibles, and computers. If you own expensive items, you can pay extra premiums to have those items fully insured under what is called a floater.\n\nMany factors go into determining the premiums for a homeowner's policy. The age of the home, the materials used to build it, where it's located, the square footage and the number of rooms all play a role. Homeowners can usually save money on insurance policies by raising their deductible. In general, the higher the deductible, the lower the premiums.\n\n", "task_id": "7964647a-2eea-455e-8d70-715ee0b209f5", "level_title": "Insurance", "label": 0}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in the United States can be a complex and sometimes daunting process, particularly for first-time buyers. The process involves several steps and significant paperwork, but with preparation and understanding, it can be managed effectively.\n\nFirstly, the housing market in the U.S. varies significantly by region. In many urban areas and popular cities, housing can be quite expensive, with prices often rising faster than the national average. Conversely, rural and less densely populated areas might offer more affordable options.\n\nWhen it comes to financing, applying for a home loan (mortgage) is a multi-step process. Potential buyers need to gather financial documentation, such as income statements, tax returns, and credit reports. Lenders will evaluate these to determine creditworthiness. The process involves filling out substantial paperwork, including a loan application and various disclosures.\n\nInterest rates fluctuate based on economic conditions, but as of 2023, they have been relatively high compared to previous years, hovering around 6-7% for a 30-year fixed mortgage. Lower rates might be available for those with excellent credit scores or who opt for adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nWhile it's not mandatory to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker, they can be incredibly helpful. Real estate agents guide buyers through the home search and negotiation process, while mortgage brokers can assist in finding competitive loan rates and terms. These professionals can streamline the process, making it more manageable and less stressful.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane comprises several important parts, each with a specific function that helps it fly safely and efficiently.\n\nThe fuselage is the main body of the airplane. It holds the cockpit, where the pilots sit, as well as the passenger cabin or cargo space. It also connects all the other parts of the airplane.\n\nThe wings are essential for flight. They create lift, which allows the airplane to rise into the air. The shape of the wings and the movement of air over them generate the necessary force to keep the plane flying. Some wings also have flaps and slats that help takeoff, land, and control speed.\nThe tail provides stability at the back of the airplane. It consists of the vertical stabilizer, which prevents the plane from swaying side to side, and the horizontal stabilizer, which helps control the up-and-down movement. The tail ensures the airplane flies smoothly in the right direction.\nFinally, the engines provide thrust, which moves the airplane forward. Most commercial airplanes have jet engines, while smaller planes might use propellers. Without engines, the airplane would not have the power to take off or stay in the air.\nEach of these parts works together to make flight possible.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

It fosters a positive environment where team members feel valued and understood. When communication is clear and open, it reduces misunderstandings and conflicts, leading to a more harmonious and productive work environment. Employees are more likely to collaborate effectively, share ideas, and work towards common goals.\n\nMoreover, good communication enhances employee engagement and morale. When leaders communicate transparently and listen to their team, it builds trust and respect. Employees feel more connected to the organization and are motivated to contribute their best efforts. This, in turn, can lead to higher job satisfaction and lower turnover rates.\n\nIn today’s fast-paced and diverse work settings, mastering communication skills is more important than ever.

In fact, they specifically praised our dedication to quality, which speaks volumes about the progress we’ve made.\n\nOf course, this success didn’t come without its challenges. Just three months ago, we were facing a series of unresolved defects that threatened to undermine our credibility. On top of that, we encountered a few smaller technical hiccups that added to the pressure.\n\nHowever, rather than letting these issues define us, we used them as a catalyst for change. We rethought how we deliver updates, making the process more reliable and responsive. At the same time, we strengthened our Quality Assurance practices to catch problems earlier. Crucially, none of this would have been possible without the close collaboration between our teams—engineering, support, and QA all pulled together.\n\nLooking ahead, we’re not stopping here.

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: The Hang Seng Index (HSI), which is Hong Kong’s primary index, has demonstrated consistent growth over the past six months. This growth has been primarily driven by significant investment from Mainland China. The influx of international investment has notably bolstered the properties and utilities sub-indices. Six months ago, the HSI had fallen to 20,956 points, but it has since climbed to an impressive peak of 27,499 points. This remarkable increase has caught many investors off guard, especially given the market's inherent fluctuations. Experts are optimistic, predicting that the index will continue its upward trajectory over the next year, supported by substantial investments from other countries and robust internal demand within Hong Kong. However, it is crucial to remain vigilant, as no index can sustain indefinite growth. Therefore, it is advisable to approach future investments with a degree of caution, ensuring that we are prepared for any potential market corrections.", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 4}

Operating costs are estimated between $6-$14 per barrel for bitumen, while producing synthetic crude ranges from $18-$22 per barrel. Supply costs are slightly higher, between $14-$24 per barrel for bitumen and $36-$40 for synthetic crude. Oil output is expected to grow significantly, with projections reaching 3.9 million barrels per day by 2015. \n\nConclusion:\nTraditional markets are likely to expand, but this anticipated growth will also require access to new or emerging markets to fully absorb increased supply.\n\nMy recommendations are: check crude oil prices regularly, acquire more detailed production data, evaluate the cost of transporting skilled labor to the area, and initiate first tests to assess in the field.\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "b99c403f-3a8e-4397-a157-2644d1952584", "level_title": "Oil and Gas Industry", "label": 4}

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In my country, robots are increasingly being used across various industries, from manufacturing and healthcare to customer service and agriculture. In factories, robots handle repetitive tasks like assembling products or welding parts, improving efficiency and reducing the risk of injuries. In hospitals, robotic assistants help with surgeries and deliver supplies, while in restaurants and stores, some robots serve food or assist customers. Personally, I feel both excited and cautious about the rise of robots. They have the potential to make life easier, safer, and more productive, especially by handling dangerous or boring tasks. However, I also worry about the impact on employment, as automation could replace many jobs, particularly for low-skilled workers. Socially, robots may improve convenience and precision, but they might also lead to less human interaction and widen the gap between those who can afford technology and those who cannot. In the future, society must find a balance—embracing innovation while also ensuring fairness, retraining workers, and protecting essential human connections.", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

The family time that I had in there was precious. As there is no issue of traffic in jamshedpur, my father used to return by 5:30pm everyday. My entire family spent every evening together. This place has the best of schools. Can anyone imagine a city of 224km^2 having 169 schools !! Yes, you read it right. This is the most amazing thing about this small City. It promotes education on a large scale. If you want to live in a clean, green city which has no hassles of traffic, electricity supply or water supply, give your children the best of schooling (secondary and higher secondary), this is one of the best cities.

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is a complex machine with several important parts that work together to make flight possible.\n\nThe fuselage is the main body of the airplane, where passengers and cargo are located. It provides structural support and holds the cockpit, where the pilots control the plane.\n\nThe wings are crucial for creating lift, allowing the plane to stay in the air. They are designed with a specific shape to help air move faster over the top than beneath, generating lift. Wings also often contain fuel tanks and may have ailerons to control the roll of the aircraft.\n\nThe tail includes the vertical stabilizer (the fin) and the horizontal stabilizer (the tailplane). The vertical stabilizer helps to keep the airplane steady by preventing unwanted side-to-side motion, while the horizontal stabilizer ensures the plane remains stable in pitch, preventing it from climbing or descending unexpectedly.\n\nFinally, the engines provide the thrust necessary for the plane to move forward. They push the airplane through the air and are usually located on the wings or the rear of the fuselage, depending on the plane's design. These components work together to keep the plane in motion and maintain control during flight.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: To lead a celebrity life, you must keep your reputation in check and always treat others with respect. Maintain an active social media presence. Celebrities often amass huge followings on social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram. Express yourself authentically, and your fans will find you. It seems like celebrities get a lot of perks such as being brand ambassadors for big brands, having access to exclusive parties and events, walking the red carpet and attending the Met Gala, and of course the money that comes with it. This all looks really attractive to regular people. However, this all comes with a price that we often tend to ignore until we face the harsh reality. \"Being famous\" may seem like a glamorous and desirable lifestyle, but the reality is often much different. The lack of privacy, high expectations, limited freedom, lack of genuine relationships, and mental health challenges can make being famous a very difficult and overwhelming experience.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: The current situation of the Spanish real estate market is broadly characterised by the high demand for housing, especially new construction, and the shortage of supply. As a result of this mismatch between supply and demand, the price of housing continues to rise. The average price of new housing in Spain has reached €2,930/m² in June 2024, with large cities such as Barcelona (€5,262/m²) and Madrid (€4,493/m²) having the highest demand, the lowest supply and, consequently, the highest prices. All these factors, combined with the fact that the average salary in Spain is relatively low, around €2,200 gross per month, mean that most people have to apply for a bank loan to buy their home. \n\nIn Spain, you can buy a home through real estate agencies or from individual to individual. Buying a property from an individual offers personalised service and saves on commissions, while real estate agencies offer expert advice and speed up the paperwork. \n\nOnce you have found the perfect house, it is time to face the process of applying for a loan. The main requirements of banks when granting a mortgage have to do with the applicant's financial situation. In order to know the stability and good current and future financial solvency of the client, the bank asks for pay slips and work history, and checks that he or she has no other outstanding debts. \n\nA good tip when applying for a loan, is to compare different mortgage loan offers from different banking entities. During this process, you also have to decide which type of mortgage best fits your financial situation: \n- Fixed rate: the same installment and the same interest rate during the life of the mortgage. \n- Variable rate: the interest rate, and consequently the installment, vary depending on the reference index published by the banking entities, which is reviewed every 6 months. \n- Mixed rate: a fixed rate is applied during the first years of the loan and then a variable interest rate is applied.\n\nAnother aspect to take into account is the fees associated with the application and granting of the mortgage loan:\n- Opening fee: paid to the bank at the beginning of the loan for paperwork and management.\n- Account fee associated with the mortgage: opening an account, with associated fees, to manage the payment of the installments.\n\nIn addition, we must not forget that mortgages have a financing limit of up to 80% of the value of the property, as well as an amortization period ranging from 20 to 30 years. \n\nIn short, taking out a mortgage is a long process that requires taking time to carefully study the options and possibilities in order to obtain the best financing.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: One of the strongest pillars of the company I work for is corporate social responsibility (CSR), and I couldn’t be more proud of that! I truly believe that all companies should embrace this sense of responsibility, considering the significant impact they have on local communities.\nSome people argue that CSR is nothing more than a cheap marketing tool to create a good public image. While it’s true that CSR can enhance a company's reputation, its benefits go far beyond that. Studies have shown that companies with strong CSR programs experience higher employee satisfaction, lower turnover rates, and increased productivity. Consumers also value these efforts — many take a company’s social and environmental practices into account before making a purchase.\nCSR is not just about giving back; it's a two-way street. When companies invest in the well-being of the community, they’re also investing in their own long-term success. A healthier, more stable society creates a better environment for business to thrive.\nIn short, I believe that companies have a responsibility not just to their shareholders, but to society as a whole. Profit and purpose can, and should, go hand in hand. To receive great returns, you must be willing to make meaningful investments — and CSR is one of the smartest investments a company can make.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In Kolkata, one of the most popular and legendary creatures in local folklore is the **Bhoot**, a ghostly figure that features prominently in the city's rich tradition of supernatural tales. The Bhoot is often described as the spirit of a person who has met an untimely or tragic death, unable to find peace and thus lingering in the physical world. In Bengali culture, these spirits are usually depicted as pale, ragged figures with hollow eyes, wandering aimlessly at night in search of vengeance or redemption.\n\nThe Bhoot's presence is often associated with eerie, dark corners of Kolkata, such as abandoned buildings, old neighborhoods, or even the banks of the Hooghly River. Kolkata’s dense fog and narrow, dimly lit alleys add to the chilling atmosphere that makes these legends come alive, particularly during festivals like **Poila Boishakh** (Bengali New Year) and **Durga Puja**, when the veil between the living and the dead is said to be thinnest.\n\nIn some variations of the story, the Bhoot is a mischievous entity, playing pranks on the living, while in others, it is more malevolent, causing fear and harm. Many families in Kolkata recount eerie experiences, contributing to the creature's enduring place in the city's cultural history. The Bhoot reflects the city's connection to both the tangible and spiritual realms, symbolizing the mysteries that lie just beyond the realm of the known.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Based on our discussion, here’s a summary of the key issues and how they may be affecting you:\n\nYour long work hours and high stress levels are leading to poor sleep and constant fatigue. Sitting all day, especially in an unsupportive chair, is likely causing your back pain. Smoking and excessive coffee intake may be quick fixes for energy, but they increase stress and harm your health in the long term.

Aim to go to bed and wake up at consistent times to improve sleep. Swap some coffee for water or herbal tea, and gradually cut back on smoking. Take short breaks during work to stretch or walk, and consider a more ergonomic chair. Try cooking simple, healthy meals and limit TV time by replacing it with light exercise or reading.\n\nThese changes will reduce your stress, boost energy, and improve your overall health.

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is a complex machine composed of several essential components, each playing a crucial role in ensuring its functionality and ability to fly. At the core is the fuselage, the main body of the aircraft, which houses the cockpit, passenger cabin, and cargo space. The cockpit contains the controls and navigation systems, enabling pilots to operate the airplane. The fuselage's structure is designed to withstand pressure differences during flight, ensuring passenger safety and comfort.\nThe wings are perhaps the most critical elements for flight. Their aerodynamic shape creates lift by generating lower pressure on the upper surface and higher pressure underneath. Flaps and ailerons on the wings further enhance control during takeoff, landing, and turns.\nThe tail assembly, also known as the empennage, provides stability. It includes the vertical stabilizer, which prevents side-to-side motion, and the horizontal stabilizer, which manages pitch control.\nFinally, engines, whether jet or propeller-based, generate the thrust necessary for forward motion. Together, these parts harmonize to enable safe and efficient air travel.\n", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: When I was a child, I had lots of books and would read them by putting a desk lamp on my desk. However, these days, you can buy the books you want to read on your smartphone or the internet, and you can read them in the dark thanks to the light from the screen, so you can read even in a dark room. I can do this right up until just before I go to bed, and I can't seem to stop. This means that my dependence on them is increasing. These days, smartphones show you how long you've been using them each day for each week, so you can control it yourself.\nIn addition, magazines and newspapers that are delivered by subscription are now also delivered to smartphones, and the business environment is changing. On the other hand, the number of advertisements attached to newspapers and subscriptions is decreasing. With regard to advertisements, a system has been introduced that allows you to turn pages, and pop-ups appear when you turn the pages, and in the same way, it is possible to earn income from advertisements.", "task_id": "7e0827d0-955c-484a-8c4f-81fe6a574af8", "level_title": "11-Upper Intermediate", "label": 4}

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: To effectively motivate your employees, consider implementing several strategies that make them feel valued and engaged. First, offer incentives that align their success with the company’s, creating a sense of ownership and shared achievement. Encourage personal and professional growth by taking an active interest in their career paths. Provide opportunities for additional training and mentorship, demonstrating that you are invested in their future. Promoting a healthy work-life balance is also key; show that you understand and respect their lives outside of work, which will enhance loyalty and job satisfaction. Additionally, make sure to listen to your employees, especially when they voice concerns or complaints. Feeling heard increases their sense of importance and boosts overall morale. Finally, always treat your subordinates with respect, just as you would expect from your superiors.\n\nOn the other hand, avoid actions that can demotivate your team. These include disrespecting employees, taking credit for their work, losing your temper in stressful situations, and allowing them to unfairly take the blame for mistakes. Failing to recognize good work or offer praise for achievements also leads to disengagement. By fostering a positive, respectful, and open work environment, you’ll keep employees motivated, engaged, and committed to their roles and the company’s success.\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: On Friday morning, at precisely 2:30 AM, a significant event unfolded at the dock involving Barry Black and Wayne White. The anticipation was palpable as the large shipment of cigarettes arrived via the luxurious yacht, Empress of the Seas. Earlier that day, a phone call had been made around midnight to inform a contact named Shirley about the impending delivery. Questions of reliability loomed, especially with the date being Friday the 13th, often deemed unlucky.\n\nAs the shipment began to offload, chaos erupted when several suspects attempted to flee the scene. Law enforcement reacted swiftly, managing to capture most of these individuals, including three designated human mules involved in transporting the contraband. This operation was the culmination of a year-long investigation into Barry Black, raising suspicions of possible connections to drug smuggling. The haul, estimated to be worth $5 million in black market cigarettes and cigars, marked one of the largest shipments intercepted to date. Fortunately, no drugs were found during the operation.\n\nThe shipment was logged upon its return to the station at 4:54 AM on that fateful day, sealing an unfortunate fate for Barry Black. With the investigation still ongoing, authorities remained vigilant, aware that this case could lead to wider implications within the realm of organized crime.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in India can be both exciting and complex, depending on the buyer's financial situation and knowledge of the process. The overall process involves several stages, including finding a property, obtaining a loan, and completing legal formalities.\n\nThe application for a home loan usually requires filling out multiple forms, such as personal details, income verification, and property-related documents. Lenders may require a good credit score, stable income, and a down payment of 10-20% of the property's value. The paperwork can be overwhelming, especially for first-time buyers. Many lenders also ask for property appraisals and legal checks, adding to the documentation burden.\n\nHousing prices in India are expensive, particularly in urban areas like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore.

So, common sense dictates that the Geothermal Fluxcapacitor E-XZ3 is the better design.  \nIn terms of fuel efficiency and environmental impact, using hydrogen instead of gasoline is a big advantage. Some people think a green supercar can't compete with the speed and horsepower of the Geothermal Fluxcapacitor XZ3.

Yes, the XZ3 has a higher top speed but it would be really useful to consider the future of the industry. Do we really want to lose market share tomorrow for a few more mph today?

I’d like to propose a third option that might offer a balance between cost savings and customer experience.\n\nWhat if we relocate to the East Market District? It’s a growing area just 10 minutes from downtown, with significantly lower rent—around $2,800/month for similar-sized spaces. The district is becoming popular with boutique businesses and has good foot traffic, especially on weekends. We could set up a smaller showroom there to maintain a physical presence and continue offering personalized service.\n\nAt the same time, we could expand our digital presence and offer on-site fittings at offices and schools, as Ken suggested. This hybrid model would allow us to reduce costs, retain loyal customers, and reach new ones through convenience and technology.\n\nWe could also host monthly pop-up events downtown to stay visible in the high-traffic area without the full-time rent commitment.\n\nLet me know what you think—happy to explore this further!\n\nBest,\nKen\n", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

A true friend is someone who supports you, listens to you, and shares both happy and difficult moments with you. Without friends, life can feel lonely and less meaningful.\n\nFriendship teaches us empathy, patience, and trust. When we are with friends, we learn how to cooperate, communicate, and care for others. Good friends help us become better people. They encourage us to reach our goals and stand by us when we fail.\n\nIn today’s fast-paced world, it is easy to lose touch with friends. That is why it is important to make time for them and keep the connection strong.

[SEP] Response: Report on Recommended Training Provides: Skills Pro\n\nIntroduction\nThis report evaluates two training providers, TrainQuick and Skills Pro, and recommends the best option for our company’s training needs. While TrainQuick is cheaper and more flexible, Skills Pro offers higher quality and better outcomes.\n\nEvaluation of Training Providers\nTrainQuick provides affordable training with flexible scheduling. However, it has not been widely used in our other branch, and employees dislike mixed-branch training sessions. This could lead to low engagement and reduced effectiveness.\n\nSkills Pro is more expensive, and some employees find the course content difficult. However, most participants complete the training successfully, indicating strong instructional quality. Additionally, Skills Pro plans to expand its course offerings, which could benefit us in the long run.\n\nRecommendation\nDespite the higher cost, Skills Pro is the better option. High-quality training leads to better employee performance, making it a worthwhile investment.\n\nConclusion\nTo ensure effective training and employee development, we should choose Skills Pro. The benefits outweigh the cost, making it the best choice for our company’s long-term success.", "task_id": "28757296-8797-428f-a562-0b03c304b341", "level_title": "14-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Setting up a new 5G network is no easy task, so I’ll try to break this down for you into small, easy-to-understand steps. In order to get government approval to roll out a new 5G network, we’ll have to demonstrate that we understand the existing mobile network and explain how we plan on integrating our own service.\n\nTo start with, our new service has to be able to communicate with and integrate into the current mobile network technology. This consists of a network of base stations, the core circuit switched network, which handles voice calls and text, a packet switched network, which handles mobile data, and the public switched telephone network to connect subscribers to the wider telephony network. Of course, we will also have to show that our service follows 5G standards, such as WCDMA.\n\nOnce this has been demonstrated to the proper governmental authorities, we need to prove that we will respect customers’ privacy with our new service. After that, we’ll have to show that we are following all the anti-monopoly regulation. This is to ensure that no one company takes control of the entire market.\n\nOnly when all of this has been completed, can we begin to approach mobile phone manufacturers, who will be able to supply the phones that will run our new service.\n\nFinally, after having passed all of these benchmarks, we will be in a very good position to gain government approval.

They dwell in subterranean realms or sacred rivers and are believed to guard treasures and hidden knowledge.\n\n🌊 In Hinduism, Nagas play a complex role. They're associated with water and fertility, and are seen as protectors of springs, wells, and rain. Some stories describe benevolent Nagas who aid humans, while others portray them as fierce and vengeful when disrespected. One of the most famous Nagas is **Shesha**, the cosmic serpent who serves as the resting couch of Lord Vishnu.\n\n With their mesmerizing appearance and deep spiritual significance, Nagas symbolize duality—danger and protection, wisdom and mystery.

A true friend is someone who supports you, listens to you, and shares both happy and difficult moments with you. Without friends, life can feel lonely and less meaningful.\n\nFriendship teaches us empathy, patience, and trust. When we are with friends, we learn how to cooperate, communicate, and care for others. Good friends help us become better people. They encourage us to reach our goals and stand by us when we fail.\n\nIn today’s fast-paced world, it is easy to lose touch with friends. That is why it is important to make time for them and keep the connection strong. Whether through a simple message, a call, or spending time together, maintaining friendships requires effort.\n\nIn conclusion, friends are not just people we enjoy spending time with—they are essential to our emotional well-being.

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is made up of several important parts, each with a specific function that helps it fly safely and efficiently. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane. It is where passengers and cargo are carried, and it also connects all the other parts of the aircraft. Inside the fuselage, you can find the cockpit, where the pilots control the airplane.\n\nThe wings are essential for flight. They are designed to create lift as the airplane moves through the air. This lift is what allows the airplane to rise off the ground and stay in the sky. Wings can also hold fuel tanks and sometimes house the landing gear.\n\nAt the back of the airplane is the tail, which helps keep the airplane stable and balanced during flight. The tail has smaller parts like the horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer, which control the pitch (up and down movement) and yaw (side to side movement) of the airplane.\n\nFinally, the engines provide the power needed to move the airplane forward. As the engines push the airplane ahead, air flows over the wings, creating lift. Together, these parts work as a team to make flying possible.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

It's understandable to feel stressed with work and personal relationships, especially when both seem challenging at the same time. Here are a few thoughts that might help:\n\nWork Stress:\n\nCommunication: It might be helpful to have a candid conversation with your manager or team leader about your experiences and what motivates you. Sometimes management isn't aware of the impact their actions (or lack thereof) have on their team.\nFocus on What You Can Control: While it's frustrating not to receive acknowledgment, try to focus on the quality of your work and the satisfaction it brings you. Maybe set personal goals or find ways to recognize your own achievements.\nConsider Your Options: If things don't improve, it might be worth considering other opportunities. Updating your resume and exploring job openings can give you a sense of control and hope for change.\nRelationship Issues:\n\nOpen Dialogue: If you haven't already, try to have an honest conversation with Tia. Understanding each other's perspectives might help you decide the best course of action, whether that's working on the relationship or parting ways amicably.\nReflect on Your Needs: Consider what you need from a relationship and whether it's being met. This can help guide your decision and ensure future relationships are fulfilling.\nTake Time for Yourself: It's important to take care of yourself emotionally. Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax.\nGeneral Tips:\n\nSeek Balance: Make sure you're dedicating time to self-care and activities you enjoy, whether it's exercise, hobbies, or spending time with friends.\nReach Out: Don't hesitate to talk to a friend, family member, or therapist who can offer support.\nMindfulness Practices: Techniques like meditation or deep-breathing exercises can help manage stress and improve emotional well-being.\nRemember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and seeking support is a strong step toward managing these challenges. I'm here if you need someone to talk to or bounce ideas off of.\n\nTake care,", "task_id": "9032f3ed-5da1-4efe-b4dd-c9470bb35d65", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Understanding Counterfeit Goods for protecting Consumers and Society from Fakes\n\nCounterfeit goods are imitation products designed to deceive consumers by mimicking genuine brands.\nThese faked products affect a wide range of societies and industries, from fashion electronics to pharmaceuticals and automotive parts.\n\nTypes of counterfeit goods are various. Luxury items: Designer handbags, watches and apparel; Electronics: headphones, batteries and smartphones; Medicines: Counterfeit drugs and supplements; Everyday items: Cosmetics, toys and food products.\n\nThe counterfeiting goods have a huge effect on society.\nCounterfeit goods harm legitimate businesses, leading to economic losses, job cuts, and damage to brand reputations.\nSuch goods may pose serious safety risks, especially in medicines, cosmetics, foods and electronics which can endanger health and security.\nProfits from such goods and services often lead to crime, further threatening communities.\n\nFor identifying counterfeiting goods, close attention should be paid by the following things: extremely lower prices than authentic products; inferior quality materials, stitching or packaging; wrong product names or altered logos; Lack of authenticity certificates or serial numbers.\n\nIf we find such counterfeit goods, what we should do is the following: If we suspect a product is fake, avoid using it and report the seller to consumer protection agencies or the product owner; Retain receipts and document your purchase for proving where you bought it; By remaining cautious and acting responsibly, we can help protect ourself and the broader community against the dangers of counterfeiting.\n\nLet's be careful not to purchase such products and to eliminate these types of counterfeit goods from society.", "task_id": "788dc6fa-5111-4a7c-b2c1-a9ddebd0b1a2", "level_title": "Police and Immigration", "label": 4}

Neither of us had any experience, but we were eager to unleash our inner artists. As the instructor demonstrated how to shape the clay on the wheel, Alex confidently nodded as if he were a pottery prodigy. When it was his turn, things took a hilarious turn.\n\nAlex started the wheel spinning at full speed, and the clay seemed to have a life of its own. It wobbled and wiggled, and before we knew it, the clay flew off the wheel and landed right on the instructor's apron. Everyone burst into laughter, including the instructor, who assured Alex that it was a common rookie mistake.\n\nDetermined to redeem himself, Alex tried again, but this time he accidentally splashed water everywhere, drenching his own masterpiece. By the end of the class, Alex's creation resembled a lopsided pancake rather than a bowl. We left with clay in our hair and on our clothes, but with memories that would last a lifetime. It turns out that pottery might not be Alex's calling, but it certainly provided us with a hilarious story to share.", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: The Big Online Debate\nDo you believe companies have a responsibility to society? Or do you think a company's only responsibility is to its shareholders? We invite you to join this discussion by posting your opinion on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nFor CSR\n\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: The Hand Seng Index (HIS) in Hong Kong has grown in the past six months, going from a low of 20,956 to a high of over 27,499. This has been mainly due to investment from Mainland Chia. Properties and Utilities Sub-indices in particular have experienced a dramatic rise due to the country's growth.

This was followed, however, by a sharp decrease, though it did not reach the preceding lows, remaining at 20,956 The good news is that this downturn preceded the current growth.

[SEP] Response: To create a comparison and contrast between my favorite place and another city, I'll choose Kyoto, Japan, as my favorite place and contrast it with New York City, USA.\n\nKyoto, Japan vs. New York City, USA\n\nCultural Heritage and Atmosphere:\n\nKyoto: Known for its rich cultural heritage, Kyoto is often considered the heart of traditional Japan. It is home to numerous ancient temples, shrines, and traditional wooden houses. The city exudes a serene and contemplative atmosphere, with picturesque landscapes and well-preserved historical sites, such as Kinkaku-ji (the Golden Pavilion) and Fushimi Inari Shrine. The city’s atmosphere is tranquil, offering a respite from the hustle and bustle of modern life.\nNew York City: In contrast, New York City is a global hub of modernity and diversity, often referred to as \"The City That Never Sleeps.\" It is characterized by its towering skyscrapers, bustling streets, and vibrant cultural scene. NYC is rich in contemporary art, theater, and music, with iconic landmarks like Times Square, Central Park, and the Statue of Liberty. The city's atmosphere is energetic and fast-paced, attracting people from all over the world.\nSize and Population:\n\nKyoto: Kyoto is a relatively small city compared to New York, with a population of about 1.5 million people. The city's size makes it more navigable and offers a sense of intimacy and community. It's easier to explore on foot or by bicycle, allowing residents and visitors to immerse themselves in the local culture.\nNew York City: NYC is one of the largest cities in the world, with a population exceeding 8 million. Its sheer size and density contribute to its vibrant and dynamic nature. The city is divided into five boroughs, each with its own distinct character, making it a melting pot of cultures and experiences.\nEconomy and Opportunities:\n\nKyoto: While Kyoto has a strong local economy, particularly in tourism and traditional crafts, it does not offer the same level of business opportunities as larger metropolitan areas. The economy is more focused on preserving cultural heritage and supporting local industries.\nNew York City: Known as a financial powerhouse, NYC is a global economic leader, offering vast opportunities in finance, media, fashion, technology, and more. Wall Street is the epicenter of global finance, and the city attracts professionals seeking career advancement and networking opportunities.\nLifestyle and Living Costs:\n\nKyoto: Living in Kyoto can be more affordable than in major global cities, with a slower pace of life. The cost of living is moderate, and residents often enjoy a balanced lifestyle with access to nature, such as the nearby Arashiyama Bamboo Grove or the Philosopher's Path.\nNew York City: NYC is known for its high cost of living, with expensive housing and daily expenses. The fast-paced lifestyle can be both exhilarating and exhausting, with endless entertainment options and a 24/7 urban experience.\nConclusion:\nKyoto and New York City each offer unique experiences and attractions. Kyoto is ideal for those who appreciate history, tradition, and a peaceful environment, while New York City appeals to those who thrive in a dynamic, cosmopolitan atmosphere. Both cities, in their own ways, capture the essence of their respective cultures and provide enriching experiences for residents and visitors alike.", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 12-Upper Intermediate [SEP] Prompt: Write about how to develop leadership qualities. You can write about personal experiences or what you have seen happen in others. What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Developing leadership skills is an ongoing process that involves self-awareness, practice, and a willingness to learn. Some of the most important qualities for a good leader are empathy, effective communication, responsibility, and vision. For example, an empathetic leader can understand the needs of the team and create a more collaborative environment, while good communication avoids potential misunderstandings and aligns the group's goals.\nAccountability is essential: when a leader admits mistakes and seeks solutions, he or she inspires trust. Vision, on the other hand, allows the leader to motivate his or her team toward clear and meaningful goals. An example of this would be a manager who identifies an employee's talent and offers them opportunities for growth, contributing to the development of both.\nI believe that everyone has the potential to become a good leader, as long as they are willing to work on their skills and overcome the challenges that arise along the way. Leadership is not a gift that is born with, but rather a set of behaviors and attitudes that can be learned and improved over time.", "task_id": "ce3f3898-f2a7-4978-8f4f-17596f229f1d", "level_title": "12-Upper Intermediate", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Challenges Faced by Language Learners\n\nLearning a new language can be an exciting yet challenging journey. Language students often encounter various issues that can hinder their progress. Here are some common challenges:\n\nPronunciation Difficulties: Many students struggle with the correct pronunciation of words. This can be due to differences in phonetic systems between their native language and the new language. Mispronunciation can lead to misunderstandings and frustration.\n\nVocabulary Retention: Memorizing new vocabulary is a significant hurdle. Students often find it difficult to remember and use new words in context. This challenge is compounded by the vast number of words they need to learn.\n\nGrammar Complexity: Understanding and applying grammar rules can be daunting. Each language has its own set of grammatical structures, which can be confusing for learners. Mistakes in grammar can affect the clarity of communication.\n\nListening Comprehension: Students often find it hard to understand spoken language, especially when native speakers talk quickly or use slang. This can make it difficult to follow conversations, watch movies, or listen to music in the new language.\n\nSpeaking Confidence: Many learners feel anxious about speaking in a new language. Fear of making mistakes or being judged can prevent them from practicing speaking, which is crucial for language acquisition.\n\nCultural Differences: Language learning is not just about words and grammar; it also involves understanding cultural nuances. Students may struggle to grasp idiomatic expressions, humor, and social norms, which are essential for effective communication.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, language learners can adopt various strategies such as regular practice, using language learning apps, engaging in conversations with native speakers, and immersing themselves in the culture of the language they are learning. With persistence and the right approach, these obstacles can be managed, leading to successful language acquisition.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Based on the results of my investigation, the best options are Train Quick and Skills Pro.\nTrain Quick remains the first choice in term of cost and flexibility, in fact, its course are very cheap however the major drawback is that its courses are being implemented in other branches of our company and employees don't like it when we mix them with people from other branches in their classes.\nBy contrast, looking at the data,  Skills Pro courses are more expensive and the high cost is the major drawback of the product. However Pro Skills is the first choice in terms of the quality of its course, the course content has been described as difficult but people who take the course often finish it successfully. \nIn conclusion, I believe that Pro Skills represents the best option for us.\n", "task_id": "28757296-8797-428f-a562-0b03c304b341", "level_title": "14-Advanced", "label": 3}

[SEP] Response: My favorite city is Tokyo, a vibrant metropolis known for its futuristic skyline, efficient public transport, and rich cultural heritage. Tokyo is a city that never sleeps, offering endless entertainment, shopping, and dining options. The blend of tradition and innovation is striking—you can visit ancient temples in the morning and explore high-tech districts like Akihabara in the afternoon. The city is clean, safe, and incredibly organized, making it a joy to explore.\n\nThen there is Goa, a coastal paradise in India known for its relaxed vibe, beautiful beaches, and Portuguese-influenced architecture. Unlike Tokyo’s fast-paced lifestyle, Goa invites you to slow down. Life here revolves around the sea, music, and food. The streets are less crowded, and the atmosphere is more laid-back and spontaneous.\n\nWhile Tokyo impresses with its precision and energy, Goa charms with its simplicity and warmth. Both places are unforgettable, but they offer completely different experiences—one is a bustling urban wonder, the other a peaceful retreat.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The whole concept of celebrity has become increasingly problematic, especially when we focus on individuals who seem to thrive solely on their public image rather than any notable talent or contribution to society. One such example is the reality TV star, whose only claim to fame is being famous for being famous. This trend encourages a shallow, superficial culture where individuals are idolized for their looks, wealth, and drama-filled lives rather than their intelligence, creativity, or efforts to make a meaningful difference in the world. The constant media attention they receive can be seen as an unhealthy obsession, distracting society from more important issues. Furthermore, many of these celebrities seem to lack the responsibility that comes with their influence. They often promote unrealistic standards of beauty, wealth, and success, which can contribute to mental health issues among vulnerable followers. Instead of using their platforms for meaningful causes, they often focus on self-promotion and perpetuating a culture of excess. This not only undermines the true potential of celebrity but also reinforces harmful societal values.\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

As humans are a social animal, acknowledgement of our hard work from others acts as a morale booster. Lack of such appreciation and acknowledgement makes you stressed out.\nHowever there are many ways to deal with the stress. The best way is to take a break and calm down. Focus on giving your best output and leave the rest on the almighty. I may be sounding spiritual but that's what the maximum you can do. You can try to mediate and try to forget things.

You can also plan a vacation with her as you will be free from your job and both can get time to spend with each other. Vacations in a quiet peaceful place act as a great stress buster. You can also restart your swimming as you liked it a lot earlier. Doing things you like also act as a great  stress buster. You can also learn cooking as you always wanted to learn.

[SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in India can be both exciting and challenging due to the complexity of the process. Homeownership is highly valued, but rising real estate prices, especially in metropolitan areas, make it a significant financial commitment.\n\nThe process begins with identifying a suitable property through real estate agents, online portals, or direct builders. Many buyers prefer using real estate agents for better property options and smoother negotiations. Once a property is finalized, applying for a home loan is the next step.\n\nHome loan applications involve extensive paperwork. Banks require identity proof, income statements, employment details, property documents, and credit history. Loan approvals depend on the applicant's credit score, income stability, and the property’s legal status. Interest rates in India typically range from 7% to 9%, though they vary based on market conditions and the applicant’s financial profile. Both fixed and floating interest rate options are available.\n\nThe process can be time-consuming due to multiple verifications and legal formalities. Buyers often hire legal advisors to ensure the property has a clear title. While applying directly to banks is common, many people use mortgage brokers to compare loan offers and secure better terms.\n\nOverall, while buying a home in India involves significant effort, proper planning and financial management can simplify the journey toward homeownership.\n", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

A well-known face can attract a larger audience and spark conversations that lead to meaningful action.\n\nPersonally, I think it is the responsibility of governments and national leaders to ensure that unjust situations are addressed and that no one is neglected. However, it is also challenging to tackle every issue that arises in a society. For those cases where leaders fall short, civil society must come together to provide solutions, and celebrities can play a crucial role in bringing visibility to these efforts.\n\nWhen used ethically, the influence of celebrities can inspire collective action and foster empathy among people who might not otherwise feel connected to certain causes. However, it is essential to remain vigilant and ensure that the focus stays on the cause, not on the celebrity.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: Learning a new language can be exciting, but it also comes with a lot of challenges. One issue I had at the beginning was understanding native speakers. They speak so quickly that I couldn’t catch a thing. I asked myself, “Should I focus more on listening practice or try to improve my vocabulary first?” Eventually, I realized I needed both. I got the hang of listening by watching movies with subtitles, and now I can understand a much more.\n\nAnother challenge was speaking. I always worried about making mistakes. I asked, “What if I sound silly?”. I’ve finally managed to speak more confidently by practicing with friends and not caring so much about being perfect.\n\nAlso, memorizing vocabulary can be boring. I don’t know if it’s going to be any faster, but next time I might try using flashcard apps or make little stories with the words.\n\nIn the end, language learning is a long journey.

Read the question, then write a suitable answer. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi A Possible Med Student,\n\nFirst off, I’m excited that you’re considering a career in medicine! It’s definitely a rewarding but challenging journey, and I’ll try to answer your questions based on my experience as a resident.\n\nBecoming a doctor requires years of education and training. After completing a medical degree, you’ll move on to clinical training, which includes internships, residency, and potentially fellowship depending on your specialty. Yes, clinical training is demanding – expect long hours, lots of learning, and sometimes high stress. But it’s also incredibly fulfilling to see patients recover or improve under your care.\n\nAs for career options, the medical field is vast. You can specialize in surgery, pediatrics, psychiatry, emergency medicine, or countless other areas. There’s also room for research, teaching, or administrative roles if that interests you.\n\nRegarding compensation, while you do earn a salary during your internship, residency, and fellowship, it’s true that the pay can be lower than expected, especially in the early years. Living expenses may feel tight, but it’s manageable if you budget wisely.\n\nFinally, working in a clinic or hospital is dynamic. You’ll encounter a wide range of cases, and the fast-paced environment often requires quick thinking and teamwork. It can be tough, but the difference you make in patients’ lives makes it all worthwhile.\n\nGood luck, and feel free to reach out if you have more questions!\n\nBest,\nGaby\nMedical Resident & Blogger\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "ae90d852-9ab7-47ca-a8f8-4a90eaec83f4", "level_title": "Medical industry", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Society and Leisure [SEP] Prompt: You are a life coach. It's your job to advise people on their lifestyle choices. You're in a consultation with a new client, Pete. Listen to him describe his lifestyle and take notes. [SEP] Response: Positive thinking is more than just a mindset—it is a powerful tool that can transform your entire life. When you focus on the good, even in difficult situations, you train your mind to see opportunities instead of obstacles. This simple shift in perspective can improve your mood, relationships, health, and success.\n\nPeople who practice positive thinking are often more resilient. They bounce back from failure faster and learn from their mistakes. They approach challenges with confidence and believe in their ability to grow and improve. This optimism creates a sense of hope that helps them keep moving forward, even when times are tough.\n\nPositive thinking also affects physical health. Studies show that people with a positive outlook are less likely to suffer from stress-related illnesses. They often sleep better, have lower blood pressure, and enjoy better overall well-being.\n\nOf course, staying positive doesn’t mean ignoring reality or pretending that everything is perfect. It means choosing to face life with courage and faith, trusting that things can get better. It involves gratitude, self-compassion, and surrounding yourself with supportive people.\n\nYou can develop positive thinking by practicing daily affirmations, setting realistic goals, and focusing on what you can control. Even small habits like smiling more or writing down things you're thankful for can make a big difference.\n\nIn a world full of negativity and pressure, choosing positivity is a powerful act. It can change your life and inspire those around you. So, no matter where you are in your journey, remember: your thoughts have power. Choose them wisely, and you can create a brighter future—one positive step at a time.", "task_id": "1e1666cf-3408-4a45-98ef-823784c658f4", "level_title": "Society and Leisure", "label": 5}

Listing, on the other hand, helps me to generate and organize ideas, ensuring that my writing is clear and cohesive.\nThese techniques complement each other well, and I often find myself using them in conjunction.

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find free writing and questioning to be particularly useful. Free writing allows for the uninhibited flow of ideas, helping to overcome writer's block and uncover hidden thoughts and perspectives. By writing continuously without worrying about grammar or structure, I can explore my thoughts more deeply and generate raw material that can be refined later.\n\nQuestioning, on the other hand, is a powerful technique for developing ideas and deepening understanding. By asking questions about a topic, I can explore different angles and uncover new insights. This technique helps in creating a more comprehensive and nuanced piece of writing. It encourages critical thinking and ensures that I consider various aspects of the subject matter.\n\nCombining these techniques, I can start with free writing to generate ideas and then use questioning to refine and expand on those ideas. This approach not only enhances creativity but also ensures that my writing is well-rounded and thoroughly explored. Overall, these techniques are invaluable tools in the writing process, helping to produce more thoughtful and engaging content.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: Society and Leisure [SEP] Prompt: You are a life coach. It's your job to advise people on their lifestyle choices. You're in a consultation with a new client, Pete. Listen to him describe his lifestyle and take notes. [SEP] Response: Key industry players\nMost of the pharmaceutical industry is concentrated in developed regions – the U.S., Europe and Japan. The market is characterized by complex national regulations and consolidation among the largest international groups.  An important reason for these mergers is the need for economies of scale, as well as the increasing amount of money dedicated to research and development (R&D).\n\nGlaxoSmithKline\nGlaxoSmithKline is a leading company focusing on research. The company was formed in 2000 through the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. Their headquarters are in the U.K., and their operations are based in the U.S. It employs more than 90,000 people worldwide and has offices in nearly every country of the world. This pharmaceutical giant holds an estimated 7 percent of the world's pharmaceutical market.\n\nConcentrating on four therapeutic areas (anti-infectives, central nervous system, respiratory and gastro-metabolic), among its most prominent products are Paxil, for depression, and Advair, for asthma. GSK is a leader in the vaccine area and has a growing portfolio of oncology products, including Hycamtin and Zofran for treating cancer. The company’s R&D budget is about $7 billion.\n\nPfizer\nPfizer is one of the world's largest consumer healthcare and pharmaceutical companies, having acquired Warner-Lambert in the year 2000. The company has three business segments: human health, animal health and consumer healthcare. The consumer business includes many of the world's best-known brands, among them Halls, Tetra, Benadryl, Sudafed, Listerine, Desitin, Schick, Visine, Bengay, Lubriderm and Zantac.\n\nMerck & Co.\nAnother leading company is Merck, a global, research-driven pharmaceutical company working toward the discovery, development, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of human and animal health products – directly and through its joint ventures. One recent partnership was initiated with another drug giant, Sanofi-Aventis SA, to become the world's largest seller of animal medications. Merck also provides group prescription drug benefit services through Merck-Medco Managed Care LLC (Merck-Medco).

{"text": "Prompt Level: 12-Upper Intermediate [SEP] Prompt: Write about how to develop leadership qualities. You can write about personal experiences or what you have seen happen in others. What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Leadership is not something you’re born with; it’s a skill you can learn and improve. Good leaders inspire and guide others, but becoming a leader takes effort and practice. The most important leadership qualities include self-awareness, which means knowing your strengths and weaknesses, and empathy, which helps you understand and support others. Leaders also need a clear vision to set goals and adaptability to handle challenges. While not everyone may want to lead, anyone willing to work on these skills can become a leader. \nTools like SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) can help you grow. For example, by understanding your strengths, you can use them to your advantage. By recognizing your weaknesses, you can work on improving them. Opportunities, like training or new tasks, can help you practice leadership, while being aware of challenges allows you to plan ahead. Another useful tool is the SMART goal method (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). For instance, you might set a goal like, “Improve teamwork by leading one project in the next three months and getting feedback from the team afterward.” \nDeveloping leadership skills is about learning and growing step by step.

[SEP] Response: On June 13, 2010, at 1818 Pacific Daylight Time, InterStar Airways Flight 293, landed at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), San Francisco, California, with the nose wheels cocked at 90 degrees. InterStar Airways was operating the airplane as a scheduled domestic passenger flight. The captain, first officer, four flight attendants, and 141 passengers were not injured. The flight departed Oakland, California, at 1531 as a non-stop to Sky Harbor International Airport, Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nThe captain noted no problems during the initial departure, and observed a positive rate of climb. The flight crew noted an error message displayed on the control board. There was a fault message for a nose landing gear shock absorber.  The data indicated that the gear handle was positioned to the down position, and there was an error message of a fault for the nose wheel steering.  \n\nThe flight diverted to San Jose, California. The captain was asked to perform a flyby of the tower for verification on the gear status. The tower, InterStar ground personnel, and a local news helicopter advised him that the nose gear was cocked 90 degrees to the left. When he found out this information, the captain decided to divert to SFO because it had optimum field conditions, a longer runway, and a better emergency support services. The crew flew for several hours to burn fuel so that they could land at a lighter weight.\n\nThe captain advised the cabin crew that in the event that the nose gear collapsed, evacuation from the front doors was not available so everyone would deplane from the rear exits. The flight crew continually updated the cabin crew and passengers about the situation, and advised the cabin crew to prepare for emergency procedures.  \n\nThe captain flew the airplane for the landing. He touched down at 120 knots, and applied normal braking at 90 knots. He held the nose gear off of the ground as long as possible. At 60 knots, the flight crew shut down the engines. They did not use reverse thrust or auto-braking. During the landing, the forward cabin crew could smell burnt rubber. The air traffic control tower confirmed that there was no fire, and the captain announced this to the cabin crew. After this notification, the passengers deplaned normally using an air stair.\n\nUpon touchdown, the tires rapidly deflated and tore apart, and both wheels were worn into the axle. During landing, the airplane's trajectory was not affected by the abnormal configuration or subsequent tire destruction, and the airplane stayed on the runway centerline.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: To be honest, I find the whole idea of celebrity culture somewhat troubling. While I appreciate that many celebrities work hard and have genuine talent, I’m bound to say that the level of attention they receive often seems excessive. For example, the media tends to focus more on what celebrities wear or who they are dating rather than their actual work. This creates unrealistic standards and encourages people, especially young fans, to value appearance and fame over substance. I can’t help but feel that this obsession with celebrity lives distracts us from more important issues. That said, I do recognize that some celebrities use their platform for good causes, which is commendable. However, I would argue that society should be more critical of how much influence we allow them to have. To put it mildly, the constant glorification of celebrity lifestyles can lead to unhealthy comparisons and a distorted sense of reality.

[SEP] Response: Facing the blank page is sometimes a torment so great that it would make climbing the Himalayas seem like a Sunday stroll; it's a hardly exaggerated hyperbole to describe the initial fear. The cursor blinks, like a mocking eye in the symbolism of the void to be filled. My mind is a chaotic field where ideas collide; to cope, I sometimes launch into free writing, letting everything flow unfiltered, an uninterrupted torrent of words. Then, an idea catches my attention, a spark that I decide to explore precisely. This is targeted free writing, like a laser beam on a precise point. I turn around this point, I come back to my sentences, I go deeper, it's the movement of the loop digging its furrow. I list the facets of the subject: its causes, its consequences, its actors, its colors, its sounds. I ask myself questions: Why is this important? Who am I writing for? What's missing? How does this subject connect with others? I try to see it from six different angles, like a mental cubage: describe it, compare it, associate it, analyze it, apply it, argue for or against it.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Celebrity Culture\n\nCelebrity worship is not a new concept. Humans are wired to be in awe of the alpha species since long. However, the definition of celebrity has certainly changed over the years. Whilst earlier, celebrities were people who had achieved something extraordinary in any field, be it academics, entertainment, sports, etc. Nowadays, the definition has broadened and anyone can achieve their 15 minutes of fame, as predicted by Andy Warhol.\n\nThe advent of internet and social media has made it possible for a layman to get famous, by just being in the right place at the right time.\n\nIt would be unfair to solely criticize hero worship of celebrities as there is also a lot of good that can be achieved if the influence of celebrities is wielded in a positive manner. One instance would be when Princess Diana helped destigmatize mingling with HIV patients just by the simple act of hugging a child in a hospital.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

He is known as the guardian of the forests and their animals, protecting them from hunters and anyone who tries to harm nature. His most striking characteristic is his feet, which are turned backward, serving to confuse those who pursue him by leaving tracks that lead in the opposite direction of his actual movement. The legend describes Curupira as a short being with red or fiery hair, who moves with great agility through the forest. He uses whistles and shouts to frighten and disorient invaders, guiding them away from his territory. Those who disrespect the forest or hunt predatorily are targets of his tricks and punishments. The story of Curupira is an important element of Brazilian popular culture, conveying values of respect and environmental preservation. His presence in the popular imagination reinforces the importance of harmony between humans and nature, serving as a constant reminder of the need to protect Brazil's natural resources.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Of the nine writing techniques introduced, metaphor and loop writing stand out to me as particularly useful. Metaphors allow for a more vivid and creative way to express ideas, making abstract concepts more tangible and engaging. They can transform a simple description into something more thought-provoking, which I find helpful in sparking deeper connections and insights in my writing. For example, describing a difficult situation as \"walking through a storm\" can instantly convey both the struggle and the resilience needed to overcome it.\n\nOn the other hand, loop writing offers a way to overcome writer’s block and refine ideas. The process of looping—where you write and then come back to expand on or refine what you've written—allows for organic development of thoughts and ensures that I don't feel stuck in one place.

Taking into account the enhanced environmental legislation and the consumer demand for the innovative technology the second design suits best for the launch next year. It helps us to be the foremost pioneers in quest of nurturing environmentally friendly designs while offering superb aerodynamics and traction. Thus, my final recommendation is that we utilize hydrogen powered design so that we can ride these currents and position ourselves favorably for the future", "task_id": "64058d7e-9b06-4ed8-9b01-5b7efb9fb3ef", "level_title": "Automotive", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most fascinating legendary creatures from Japanese folklore is the **Kitsune**. These mythical foxes are revered for their intelligence and magical abilities. Kitsune, which means \"fox\" in Japanese, are believed to possess the power to shapeshift into human form, often transforming into beautiful women to trick or enchant humans. They are associated with Inari, the Shinto deity of rice, fertility, and prosperity, and are thought to act as the deity's messengers.\n\nKitsune are known to have multiple tails, with legends stating that they can grow up to nine tails as they age and gain more wisdom and power. A nine-tailed fox is considered the most powerful and is known as a **Kyūbi no Kitsune**. These creatures are also said to have the ability to generate fire or lightning, possess incredible longevity, and have the capacity to enter and manipulate dreams.\n\nWhile Kitsune can be benevolent and protective, they can also be mischievous or malevolent, depending on the tale. They often serve as moral lessons, warning against greed, arrogance, and disrespect towards others. The duality of the Kitsune—capable of both kindness and trickery—adds a rich complexity to their legend, making them one of the most enduring and intriguing figures in Japanese mythology.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Write 50-70 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: A hotel is a commercial establishment that provides lodging, meals, and other services to guests, travelers, and tourists. Hotels can range from small family-run businesses to large international chains. Most hotels list a variety of services, such as room service, laundry, and concierge. Some hotels also offer meeting and conference facilities, fitness centers, and spas.\n\nAs a commercial enterprise, hotels are also dependent on advertising and on potential customers becoming aware of their hotel and booking it. Therefore, most hotels are also represented on the Internet. Often with their own website and on hotel search and booking portals as well as on blogs, yellow pages and online industry directories. Here it is important to present the hotel appealingly and to provide it with good descriptions of hotels.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHotel Online Web Presence\nLearn How To Create Written Description Of Hotels\nHotels Online Blogs\nTen Tips for Writing great Descriptions for Hotels\nHow To Avoid Writing Confusing Words When Describing A Hotel\nDescriptions of Hotels – Conclusion\nOnline Presence of Hotels and the Importance of Descriptions of Hotels thereby\nTo have a successful hotel business in the modern age, it is essential to have a strong online presence. Guests expect to be able to find information describing a hotel online, and they will often make their decision about where to stay based on what they find.\n\nThere are a number of ways to establish an online presence, but one of the most important ones is to have a well-designed website. A hotel’s website should be easy to use and informative, giving potential guests a good idea of what the hotel has to offer. It is also important to ensure that the website is optimized for search engines. This will help potential guests find the hotel when they are looking for accommodations in the area.\n\nIn addition to having a website, a hotel should be listed on popular travel websites and booking platforms, as well as have a strong social media online presence. This is easily accomplished by using formal language when writing and describing a hotel in textual blog content, allowing a hotel to become more appealing. These strategies ensure that a hotel’s brand awareness grows and that it has the resources and opportunities to connect with past and future potential guests.\n\nTip for your Descriptions of Hotels:\nUse the knowledge and skills of the crowd to have unique hotel descriptions written for your hotel or hotel portal. Learn more about clickworkers\n\n\nLearn How To Create Written Description of Hotels\nWriting hotel descriptions can be both challenging and rewarding. Hotel descriptions are meant to give potential guests an idea of what the hotel is like and what they can expect when they stay there. It’s essential to paint a picture that accurately reflects a hotel, and keep it up to date, while also highlighting what makes it unique and special.\n\nA few factors to keep in mind when describing a hotel are to pay attention to how you showcase the location, amenities, rooms, service, and overall experience. To can create better content identify and explain each feature like this:\n\nLocation – Describe the location by identifying if the hotel is centrally located or if it’s near any attractions or landmarks. You can include interesting facts and figures about this but don’t bombard readers with too much information.\nAmenities – Highlight the kind of amenities the hotel offers. If there is a pool, spa, gym, restaurant, or bar you are going to want to mention that. As well as free breakfast.\nRooms – Inform consumers of the types of rooms you have and point out if they are accessible, spacious, modern, or well-appointed. Include as many details as possible such as “hot burner plates available upon request, detailed size information on the height of beds and furniture in all rooms, and floor levels to find those specific rooms”. This helps non-disabled individuals and individuals with disabilities who seek that information.\nRates – Be sure to include information about special rates and discounts that may be available, especially around holidays and other special event days.\nService – Go into detail on the kind of service guests can expect. For example, you can state that your staff is friendly and efficient or offer airport shuttle or concierge service. Highlighting services is also a great opportunity to share a little bit about the history of the hotel. And make sure to mention any unique selling points or awards the hotel may have received for its service.\nOverall experience – Display the hotel’s overall feeling or atmosphere it wants to represent to consumers. For families, hotels can say that their hotel is warm and inviting. For business travelers, hotels can say their hotel is luxurious and sophisticated.\nPhotos and Video gives hotel websites a boost\nMost hotels rely on one page and contact form to provide most of the information to potential guests. The problem is that those two are not enough to get a complete picture of what the hotel can offer. This is why photos and videos are so important.\n\nShowcasing photos and videos on a hotel website or social platform can help educate potential customers so they can make an informed decision before choosing the hotel.\n\nHotels Online Blogs\nHotel descriptions are becoming a more prominent part of search engine marketing technology, however, they are more difficult to write than they might sound. To make a description of hotels writing bulletproof, unskippable, and exciting is by having a blog feature. Because hotels are not just places to stay they are also a place where people go for a vacation. This means that when describing a hotel the information should include details about what activities you can do in them and not just about the room.\n\nThe best content to write within a blog feature is blog posts, social media posts, guest blog posts, and video posts.\n\nBlog posts – A discussion where a writer talks about popular topics and posts on a regular basis so that readers are always engaged.\nSocial media posts – Short visual or written text postings that talk about popular topics and post regularly so that your followers are always engaged.\nVideos – Live or prerecorded content that shows what the hotel is like or highlights its features. There are many ways videos can be compelled. It can be short ones like Reels or TiKToks or longer content which is used more on Facebook and Instagram. Social media videos can be linked or posted in a blog post very easily.\nGuest blog posts – Written content of the hotel experience or opinion from a visitor’s point of view. An example of this could be a post titled “My Weekend Getaway At The Hilton Hotel” and be written by a popular travel blogger.", "task_id": "ea5ec6e9-44ee-446c-a9e5-d8e47081f763", "level_title": "12-Upper Intermediate", "label": 0}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Training Company Recommendation: Skills Pro\n\nThis report recommends Skills Pro as our training provider. We evaluated two companies: TrainQuick and Skills Pro.\n\nTrainQuick, while cost-effective and flexible, has a significant drawback: low adoption in other branches.  Employee feedback indicates resistance to mixed-branch classes, suggesting potential cultural or quality mismatches.  This low utilization negates the benefits of its flexibility and lower cost.\n\nSkills Pro, though more expensive, offers a higher quality training program.  While the course content is considered challenging, the high success rate among participants demonstrates its effectiveness.  This rigorous approach is likely to yield better long-term results through improved employee skills and performance.  Furthermore, Skills Pro's plan to expand its course offerings indicates a commitment to growth and a wider range of relevant training options in the future.\n\nWhile the higher cost of Skills Pro is a factor to consider, the superior quality, high success rate, and future expansion potential make it a worthwhile investment.  A cost-benefit analysis, comparing the return on investment of improved employee skills against the training cost, is recommended.  We believe Skills Pro will provide a greater return on investment than TrainQuick.", "task_id": "28757296-8797-428f-a562-0b03c304b341", "level_title": "14-Advanced", "label": 5}

Compare your text with the model. [SEP] Response: NTASIA – Background Information for Deploying Units\n\nThe situation in the Federation of Pantasia began to cause the international community concern a year ago when an election resulted in a vote to break up the federation and form two separate countries for its two main ethnic groups, the Alphas and the Betas. Fighting broke out for control of the mineral-rich Argos Region, as well as between certain minority groups who were made refugees. There is also evidence of an attempt at ethnic cleansing of a minority group.\n\nSix months ago the military staged a coup to reunite the Federation. Although a large portion of the armed forces have returned to Federal control, elements have remained loyal to the new governments of Alpha and Beta. These armies have had small battles between themselves over disputed territories while resisting operations by the Federal forces based in Federal Territory.\n\nUntil a month ago the situation was a stalemate, however, the various factions have been rearming under the pretence of negotiations. Recently, strong leadership in Beta has resulted in a campaign that has pinned down Federal forces and Beta forces have also launched an all-out attack through Alpha territory to seize valuable land in Argos.\n\nThis has resulted in considerable civilian casualties, refugees and dislocation of population. There are reports of executions, rape, destruction of property and infrastructure. It is also believed that Beta has established concentration camps as part of its ethnic cleansing policy.", "task_id": "f5795954-97ae-4728-b576-81b7571f3755", "level_title": "Office", "label": 0}

Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in India can be a complex process, but with the right guidance, it becomes manageable. The first step is to identify the property you wish to purchase. Housing prices vary significantly depending on the location, with metropolitan areas like Mumbai and Delhi being more expensive compared to smaller cities and towns.\n\nOnce you have chosen a property, the next step is to apply for a home loan. This involves a considerable amount of paperwork. You will need to provide proof of identity, address, income, and employment, along with property documents. Banks and financial institutions also require a good credit score to approve a loan.\n\nInterest rates on home loans in India typically range between 7% and 9%, but this can vary based on the lender and your credit profile. It's essential to compare rates from different banks to get the best deal. Fixed and floating interest rate options are available, each with its pros and cons.\n\nUsing a real estate agent can be beneficial, especially for first-time buyers. Agents can help you find properties that meet your criteria and assist with negotiations. Similarly, a mortgage broker can help you navigate the loan application process, ensuring you get the best terms and rates.\n\nOverall, while the process of buying a home and securing a loan in India involves several steps and considerable paperwork, with proper planning and professional assistance, it can be a rewarding experience leading to homeownership.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Hi there,\n\nThanks for your thoughtful question—it's one I get often, and I’m glad you’re exploring medicine with curiosity and realism.\n\nBeing a doctor is incredibly fulfilling, but yes, the path is long and challenging. Medical school is rigorous, especially clinical training, which demands both mental focus and emotional resilience. You’re expected to absorb a vast amount of information, make quick decisions, and work long hours—all while learning to communicate with compassion.\n\nDuring residency and fellowship, you do get paid, but it’s not a high salary, especially considering the hours (often 60–80+ per week) and student loan debt. That said, you usually can make ends meet with budgeting.\n\nThe day-to-day work varies greatly depending on your specialty. In hospitals, things move fast, and you often deal with critical situations. Clinics tend to be more structured with regular hours, focusing on continuity of care and long-term relationships with patients. There are also non-clinical paths like research, education, or health policy.\n\nIf you’re passionate about science and helping people, and can handle pressure and delayed gratification, it’s an incredibly meaningful career. Shadow some doctors if you can—it’s the best way to see if it’s right for you.\n\nWishing you all the best on your journey!\nRVH", "task_id": "ae90d852-9ab7-47ca-a8f8-4a90eaec83f4", "level_title": "Medical industry", "label": 5}

Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Media has transformed dramatically over the course of my lifetime: from print newspapers and broadcast television to digital platforms and on-demand content. In the past, people relied heavily on newspapers, magazines, and scheduled TV programs for news and entertainment; these sources were limited, yet trusted. Today, I primarily use digital media—news apps, podcasts, social media, and streaming services—which offer instant access to a vast range of content. This shift has changed my reading habits significantly: I now consume shorter articles, skim headlines, and often multitask while listening to audio content. Although this provides convenience and variety, it has also reduced the depth of my engagement with long-form reading. Moreover, the constant flow of updates can be overwhelming; therefore, I’ve learned to curate my sources carefully. In essence, while media has become more accessible and interactive, it demands greater discipline to stay informed without becoming distracted. In essence, while media has become more accessible and interactive, it demands greater discipline to stay informed without becoming distracted.

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: The Hang Seng Index (HSI), which is a major stock market index in Hong Kong, has experienced notable and steady growth over the past six months. This positive trend is largely attributed to significant investment inflows from Mainland China, which have boosted investor confidence and market activity. Among the various sectors represented in the index, the Properties and Utilities Sub-indices have shown particularly dramatic increases. This surge is closely linked to the robust economic growth and demand coming from China, which has had a direct impact on these sectors. Six months ago, the HSI experienced a decline, dropping to 20,956 points. However, since that low point, the index has rebounded impressively, reaching a high of 27,499. Financial experts and market analysts are optimistic about the future performance of the Hang Seng Index. They believe that the index will continue to rise in the coming year, driven not only by ongoing massive investments from other countries but also by strong internal demand within Hong Kong itself. This outlook suggests a promising period ahead for investors and the Hong Kong stock market as a whole.\n", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 4}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: As I read through the provided postings on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), I was struck by the contradicting views on the role of companies in the society. While some argue that CSR is a moral imperative, others contend that a company's sole responsibility is to its shareholders. In my opinion, CSR is not only a moral obligation but also a strategic imperative for businesses.\nAs lil@213 pointed out, companies have a significant impact on the development of society, and it is essential that they give back to the communities where they operate. This can be achieved through sustainable operations, fair employment benefits, and philanthropic initiatives. These efforts, not only do contribute to the well-being of society, but they also make good business  sense, as Jack@MSU noted. Companies with a strong CSR record are often rewarded with customer loyalty, which can lead to increased profits and competitiveness.\nWhile some may argue that CSR is a luxury that only affluent companies can afford, I believe that it is essential investment for all businesses. By integrating CSR into their operations, companies can mitigate risks, enhance their reputation and create long term value.\nIn conclusion, CSR is not a choice, but a necessity for businesses that want to thrive in today's social conscious market. By embracing CSR, companies can not only contribute to the greater good but also ensures their own long term gain or success.\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 4}

Motivating a team is both an art and a science, and the best managers know how to balance encouragement with clear expectations.\nOne of the most effective ways to inspire your team is by fostering a positive and supportive work environment. Recognizing individual and group achievements—both big and small—helps boost morale and reinforces good performance. Encouraging open communication ensures that your team feels heard and valued. Set clear, achievable goals and provide the necessary resources for success. Most importantly, lead by example—your enthusiasm and commitment will set the tone for the team.\nHowever, there are strategies to avoid. Micromanaging can diminish confidence and stifle creativity. A lack of transparency or inconsistent communication can lead to confusion and disengagement. Setting unrealistic expectations can frustrate employees and lower motivation. Also, neglecting team-building efforts can weaken collaboration and trust.\nBy focusing on empowerment, clarity, and support, you'll cultivate a motivated and high-performing team.

Make it interesting and descriptive, and remember to check for pronoun reference. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi Tanya,\n\nHope you are doing well! \nAs per your request, I am sharing this incident with you from my school days. At times one feels that things can’t go any worse, and the instance I am going to share is definitely one of those times. It was the day before my chemistry practical examination and all the students were required to bring with them their chemistry record. The day before, I had spent most of my time at my friend - Rosy’s house playing badminton, so you can assume that I was more than nervous about the upcoming examination. When I reached school and had entered my class, I saw everyone with their records and experienced a sick feeling in my stomach. Had I brought my record? I skimmed through my bag immediately and realized with utmost horror that I had not! We are not allowed to bring phones to our school, so there was no way I could have anyone bring my record. As I had no other option, I borrowed Rosy’s bicycle and decided to sneak out of school. I rode home at full speed, but as luck would have it, it had rained the night before and I was drenched through. As soon as I reached home, I changed into a new uniform and began searching for my record notebook. I searched frantically for about twenty minutes but still could not find it. Since I had sneaked out of school, I had to make up an excuse for leaving. So, I took the first bag I could find, and if anyone asked where I had been, I would show them my bag and hope that they wouldn’t ask any further questions.\n\nThis time I made sure to wear a raincoat to save the P.T. teacher the trouble of scolding me for coming in with a wet uniform. I spent most of the ride to school thinking about how I would break the news to my chemistry teacher. When I finally did reach school, I rushed back into class and settled into my seat, like I had never left it. As I sat there pitying myself, Rosy slapped me on the back and started laughing. I could not discern what was so funny, and I was not amused. When she continued laughing for about five minutes, I was irked and asked her what she thought was so funny. She then pulled out my chemistry record note from under my desk, handed it to me and then started laughing all over again. I felt embarrassed, frustrated and relieved all at the same time. I was saved of my teacher’s wrath, but no one could save me from being ridiculed by my friends.\nHope this story gives you a good giggle!\n\nBest Regards,\nMadhu.", "task_id": "52a760cd-9898-4cce-bb43-c490923b2b45", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Police and Immigration [SEP] Prompt: Now prepare the content for an informative web page about counterfeit goods. Be sure to keep the following points in mind: Types of counterfeit goods, the effect of counterfeiting on society, the signs of a fake, what to do if you discover fake goods.  Write 250-300 words. [SEP] Response: Saturday afternoon and the market’s crowded with the usual shoppers, all looking for a bargain. Instead of spending your day at the glitzy designer stores at the Urban Village Shopping Mall, you join the crowd of people gathered at the knock-off market. You notice one vendor selling cheap designer handbags and accessories, and you think about how trendy you would look wearing that watch or those fashionable shoes. Who could blame you for wanting a bargain? But after you understand the real cost this multi-million dollar counterfeiting industry has on the global economy, you may change your mind.\n\nEstimated by the International Chamber of Commerce that counterfeit goods comprise 5 to 7% of global trade. The majority of these products are common, household goods we use every day - cigarettes, alcohol, perfume, DVDs, clothing, shoes and accessories, computer supplies and software, and electronic goods like batteries. Even toothpaste makes the list in a few countries. However, even though a product is fake, it will probably cost the same as the real thing. Not only are you getting an inferior quality product, but you’re also not saving any money!\n\nOn the one hand, some people argue that major corporations are making millions of dollars in profit and need to be challenged. Perhaps counterfeiters are doing a community service? On the other hand, the more we as consumers buy these knock-off goods, the more we contribute towards job losses when the brand-name company’s profits go down. What’s more, when drugs, foods and electronic products are fake, they can be seriously dangerous because of the poor quality of the product; they can even be fatal in some cases, so it’s best to avoid counterfeit goods altogether.\n\nDon’t miss the second article in this series highlighting the dangers of counterfeit pharmaceutical products in next month’s edition.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: NAFTA is a regional trade agreement among the countries of North America. The member states of the agreement are: The US, Canada and Mexico. It took them years to negotiate about the terms of this agreement, but finally in January 1994 the agreement came into force.\nNAFTA reduced or eliminated customs duties among the members of the agreement, and as a result it has had a profound effect on trade relations, especially in agriculture. What this meant was, that business among the member countries became much easier, for example Mexican fruits and vegetables started to flow into the US.\nAs a matter of fact the consequences of this agreement had both positive and negative impacts on the member states. For example NAFTA contributed to the relocation of manufacturing jobs from the US to Mexico, particularly in industries like automotive and textiles, due to lower labor costs. This led to job losses for some US workers and downward pressure on wages for those with lower levels of education. But nevertheless, overall benefits all three members received were bigger than negative con of the agreement.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: \nFor Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is vital for modern businesses as it aligns with ethical practices and sustainable growth. Proponents argue that CSR enhances a company's reputation, builds consumer trust, and fosters customer loyalty. By addressing social and environmental issues, companies can differentiate themselves from competitors and create a positive brand image. CSR initiatives can lead to operational efficiencies and cost savings, such as reducing waste or conserving energy. Furthermore, engaging in CSR attracts and retains employees who value social consciousness in their workplace. It also opens up new market opportunities by appealing to socially responsible investors and consumers. Ultimately, CSR contributes to long-term business success and societal well-being.\n\nAgainst Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):\n\nCritics of CSR argue that it diverts focus from a company's primary economic role—maximizing shareholder value. CSR can be seen as a distraction, imposing additional costs and operational complexities that do not directly contribute to profit. Some believe that CSR initiatives are often superficial, serving as public relations tools rather than genuine commitments to social change. This \"greenwashing\" can mislead consumers and stakeholders. Additionally, detractors claim that CSR efforts can lead to conflicts of interest, with businesses potentially prioritizing social goals over economic performance. Critics assert that the responsibility for societal and environmental challenges should lie with governments and NGOs, not profit-driven corporations.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 15-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language is a transformative journey, yet it's often fraught with a unique set of challenges that can deter even the most enthusiastic students. One primary hurdle is the sheer volume of new vocabulary and grammatical structures. Memorization can be tedious, and without consistent practice, newly acquired knowledge quickly fades. Furthermore, many learners struggle with a lack of immersion. In non-native speaking environments, opportunities for authentic communication are limited, making it difficult to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application. This can lead to a pervasive fear of making mistakes, paralyzing students and preventing them from engaging in conversations crucial for fluency.\nBeyond the linguistic complexities, motivational issues often arise. The initial excitement can wane when progress feels slow or plateaus. Maintaining discipline for consistent study, especially alongside other commitments, becomes a significant test of perseverance. Cultural nuances also pose a considerable challenge; a language isn't just words but a reflection of a culture, and misinterpretations can easily occur without sufficient cultural understanding. Finally, finding effective and engaging learning resources can be a struggle. Overcoming these obstacles requires dedication, a willingness to embrace errors as part of the learning process, and a strategic approach to continuous practice and self-correction.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: The discussion around Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is one of the most compelling conversations in business ethics today. Some argue that companies, as integral parts of society, must contribute positively to the communities they operate in. Others believe businesses exist solely to generate profits for their shareholders, and social responsibility should fall to governments and nonprofit organizations.\nPro-CSR Advocates emphasize that businesses benefit from their surrounding communities and should reciprocate by supporting local initiatives, fair employee wages, and sustainable operations. They also highlight how consumers prefer ethical businesses, making CSR a sound financial investment. Companies like Patagonia and Ben & Jerry’s have shown that social initiatives can lead to brand loyalty and long-term profitability.\nCritics of CSR, on the other hand, argue that businesses are primarily economic entities, not charitable organizations. Milton Friedman famously stated that a corporation's only responsibility is to maximize shareholder value. Some skeptics also believe CSR efforts are often superficial and used for marketing purposes rather than genuine social good.\nAs sustainability and ethical consumerism gain momentum, this debate will likely continue evolving. Where do you stand? Should businesses prioritize social good alongside profit-making, or should they stick to shareholder interests?yes\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Banking and Finance [SEP] Prompt: You are a journalist for a financial magazine. You've been asked by your editor to write a report on the performance of the Hang Seng (HSI) stock market index. You have some notes and a graph as your guide. Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: **HSI Shows Strong Recovery and Promising Outlook**\n\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI) in Hong Kong has seen a strong and steady rise over the past six months, fueled largely by renewed investment from Mainland China. After dipping to 20,956 six months ago, the index has since climbed impressively to a recent high of 27,499 — a significant rebound that reflects growing investor confidence.\n\nMuch of this growth has been driven by the Property and Utilities sub-indices, which have surged on the back of increased activity and expansion from Chinese firms. These sectors, seen as stable and essential, have become particularly attractive in a climate of cautious optimism.\n\nMarket analysts remain bullish on the HSI’s future, predicting continued upward momentum into next year. They cite not only sustained interest from Mainland investors but also a rising wave of international capital and a recovery in Hong Kong’s domestic demand.\n\nWith both regional and global factors aligning in its favor, the HSI is positioning itself as one of Asia’s top-performing indices — offering opportunities and optimism to investors watching the post-pandemic recovery unfold.", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 5}

Be sure to polish your work before you submit it. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: When it comes to choosing favorite cities, New York City is always at the top of my list. The Big Apple is a whirlwind of energy, with its iconic skyline, diverse culture, and endless possibilities. It's the kind of place where you can find yourself eating a bagel in Central Park in the morning, visiting the Met in the afternoon, and catching a Broadway show by night. The city is a living, breathing entity, always on the move. The subway system, though sometimes chaotic, is a lifeline that connects the city's vibrant neighborhoods, each with its own unique flavor.\n\nOn the flip side, Tokyo offers a completely different but equally captivating experience. The first thing that strikes you about Tokyo is its incredible blend of the ultramodern and the traditional. One moment you're in the neon-lit streets of Shibuya, surrounded by towering digital billboards, and the next, you're in a serene temple in Asakusa, taking in the tranquility. Tokyo’s public transportation is a marvel of efficiency and cleanliness, making it easy to explore every corner of the city. The food scene is another highlight, with everything from world-class sushi to comforting bowls of ramen.\n\nNew York and Tokyo are both dynamic cities, but they offer different vibes. New York is all about diversity and cultural richness; it's a place where you can experience the world in a single city. Tokyo, on the other hand, impresses with its seamless integration of cutting edge technology and deeprooted traditions. Each city has its own unique charm and leaves a lasting impression, making them both top destinations on any traveler's list.", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In the current age of consumerism, celebrities play a major role by being the brand ambassadors for various brands. These celebrities usually appeal to the emotions of the consumers during their decision-making process, because a consumer is very likely to recollect the name of a brand their favorite celebrity has endorsed. Their impact can be usually seen in how the customers equate a celebrity with the brand they endorse.\n\nThe burning question that needs to be explored is whether these celebrities themselves use the products they endorse. These days we see artists endorsing ice-creams and other sweets, whereas on the contrary, we see them admitting on the talk shows that they themselves stay away from sugary and processed foods for keeping their health on check. There are also celebrities who endorse products that contain tobacco like Paan Parag, which are known to be addictive and cancer-causing. Normalizing such behaviors like smoking or substance use sends a very dangerous message to their followers.\n\nAs uncle Ben says in the Spiderman movie, “With great power comes great responsibility”, it is important for the celebrities to be mindful and understand the impact they have on the public. They should refrain from endorsing such harmful products/brands and should strive to set good examples for the people.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: The Properties Sub-index is one of the four sub-indices of the Hang Seng Index, which also includes Finance, Utilities, and Commerce & Industry1. The Properties Sub-index specifically tracks the performance of companies in the real estate sector. This sub-index includes 10 company stocks that are primarily involved in real estate activities2.\n\nOver the past six months, the Properties Sub-index has experienced significant growth, largely driven by investments from Mainland China. This influx of capital has led to increased demand for real estate, resulting in higher property prices and improved financial performance for companies within this sector1.\n\nThe methodology for selecting constituents of the Properties Sub-index involves evaluating eligible securities within the real estate industry based on factors such as market capitalization, turnover, and financial performance1. The goal is to ensure that the sub-index accurately reflects the overall performance of the real estate sector in Hong Kong.\n\nExperts believe that the Properties Sub-index will continue to rise in the coming year, fueled by ongoing investments from Mainland China and other countries, as well as strong internal demand in Hong Kong.", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: Law [SEP] Prompt: Review your notes and write a case report stating who was found guilty and why. Briefly comment on whether you found the verdict appropriate. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.", "task_id": "bb0d114c-9550-4f27-9138-b2eb14c39437", "level_title": "Law", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Developing leadership qualities is an ongoing process that involves self-knowledge, practice and learning from experiences.

When a leader puts himself in others' shoes, he creates an environment of trust and collaboration, essential for the group's success.\n\nMost important quality is emphaty because empathy is an extraordinary quality that brings countless benefits to both personal and professional relationships. When we are empathetic, we are able to put ourselves in someone else's shoes, understanding their emotions, challenges and perspectives.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most fascinating legendary creatures from Indian mythology is the Nāga. Nāgas are serpent-like beings that appear in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions. Often depicted as half-human and half-cobra, they are considered powerful and wise, dwelling in the underworld (Pātāla) or in bodies of water like rivers and lakes.\n\nNāgas are deeply symbolic—representing both danger and protection. In Hinduism, they are associated with water, fertility, and the underworld. The most famous Nāga is Shesha, the cosmic serpent who serves as the bed of Lord Vishnu. Another well-known Nāga is Vāsuki, who was used as a rope during the churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthan).\n\nIn Buddhist lore, Nāgas are protectors of the Buddha and his teachings. One tale tells of a Nāga sheltering the meditating Buddha from a storm by spreading its hood over him.\n\nThough sometimes feared for their temper, Nāgas are also revered and worshipped, especially during festivals like Nāga Panchami, where devotees offer milk and prayers to snake idols seeking blessings and protection.\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has sparked considerable debate, with arguments both for and against the idea that companies should prioritize social and environmental concerns alongside profits. However, I strongly believe that CSR is not just a moral obligation—it is a business necessity.\nCompanies exist within a broader social framework, and their operations directly impact communities, employees, and the environment. Ignoring these responsibilities can lead to public backlash, reduced consumer trust, and long-term financial losses. Businesses that engage in ethical practices—such as fair wages, sustainable sourcing, and community support—build stronger relationships with their stakeholders. As one contributor, Jack@MSU, pointed out, CSR makes good business sense because consumers care. A company that demonstrates genuine social commitment is often rewarded with customer loyalty, enhanced brand reputation, and even increased profitability.\nOn the other hand, some argue that a corporation’s sole duty is to maximize profits for shareholders, as Milton Friedman famously stated. While profitability remains a priority,ethical business conduct can contribute to financial success rather than hinder it. Companies that embrace CSR attract top talent, reduce regulatory risks, and foster innovation by investing in sustainable solutions.\nUltimately, businesses should not view CSR as a burden but as an opportunity—an investment in long-term success, societal well-being, and environmental sustainability. Responsible companies don’t just thrive; they shape a better world for future generations.\n\n\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

This consists of a network of base stations, the core circuit switched network, which handles voice calls and text, a packet switched network, which handles mobile data, and the public switched telephone network to connect subscribers to the wider telephony network.

He was on a hike in the Amazon rainforest, near Poxoréu, Mato Grosso – you know, the kind of place where you expect to see incredible wildlife, not… well, this.\n\nHe’d stopped for a water break by a small, secluded waterfall when he heard it: a faint, almost melodic humming sound. Curious, he pushed through some thick foliage and found himself in a small clearing. And there it was. Not a jaguar, not a rare bird, but a perfectly preserved, miniature, bright green spacesuit, no bigger than a teacup, resting on a mossy rock.\n\nHe swears it was glowing faintly. He didn't touch it, just stared, absolutely dumbfounded. Before he could even process what he was seeing, a tiny, iridescent butterfly, unlike any he’d ever seen, fluttered down, landed on the helmet, and then — get this — the humming stopped, and the spacesuit just vanished. Poof! Gone.\n\nLeo’s usually so grounded, so logical. But he came back from that hike a changed man, buzzing with an energy I’ve never seen. He’s convinced he stumbled upon something truly extraordinary. And honestly, after hearing him tell it, I’m starting to wonder if we’re really alone after all.", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: \nHang Seng Index Report\n\nOver the past six months, the Hang Seng Index (HSI) in Hong Kong has demonstrated steady growth, primarily driven by significant investment from Mainland China.

One major concern is the potential for algorithmic bias, which could lead to discriminatory outcomes for certain patient populations. \n For instance, if an AI model is trained on biased data, it may misdiagnose or recommend inappropriate treatments for individuals from underrepresented groups. Furthermore, the \"black box\" nature of some AI algorithms raises questions about transparency and accountability. Patients and clinicians may struggle to understand how AI systems arrive at their decisions, making it difficult to trust and implement their recommendations. Addressing these ethical challenges requires a collaborative effort, involving clinicians, ethicists, policymakers, and AI developers to ensure responsible and equitable implementation of AI in healthcare", "task_id": "8dab61c3-5199-4396-87e2-1618ae59b47a", "level_title": "7-Intermediate", "label": 5}

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: Hang Seng Index Performance: A Snapshot of Hong Kong’s Stock Market Trends\n\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI), one of Asia's most prominent stock market indices, has recently shown a mixed performance, reflecting a volatile global economic environment. Over the past year, the HSI has experienced significant fluctuations, largely driven by external factors such as geopolitical tensions, global inflation concerns, and shifting investor sentiment in China.\n\nIn the first quarter of this year, the HSI saw a moderate uptick, with key sectors like technology and consumer goods showing strong growth. However, the index faced setbacks in the subsequent months, as concerns over China’s economic slowdown and tighter regulations on big tech companies dampened investor confidence. Despite these challenges, the HSI has shown resilience, maintaining a recovery trend toward the end of the year.\n\nLooking at the performance graph, it's evident that the index struggled to break past major resistance levels, but it remains a barometer for market sentiment in Hong Kong. Analysts believe that the HSI's future performance will depend on the broader global economic recovery, stability in China’s markets, and ongoing regulatory developments.\n\nOverall, while the HSI remains a key indicator for investors, navigating the current volatility requires caution and strategic investment decisions.", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 5}

Inari's foxes are considered messengers and guardians, bringing good fortune to those who honor them.\n\nThe stories of Kitsune vary widely, from mischievous tricksters who play pranks on humans to loyal companions who fall in love with them. Some tales even describe Kitsune as guardians of sacred places, using their powers to ward off evil spirits.\n\nTheir dual nature—capable of both good and mischief—makes Kitsune a complex and intriguing figure in Japanese mythology.

The first location is planned for Lisbon, a hub for remote professionals, with future expansion to Bali and Medellín. Our brand will focus on community-building, sustainability, and affordability while maintaining premium service quality. Strategic partnerships with travel platforms and remote work communities will drive visibility and customer acquisition.\n\nRisk Assessment\nWhile the market opportunity is strong, several risks must be managed. These include economic downturns affecting travel, evolving remote work regulations, and competition from Airbnb and hostels. To mitigate these, we will maintain flexible pricing strategies, continuously adapt offerings based on customer feedback, and prioritize locations with stable tourism and digital infrastructure.

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: \nAmong the nine writing techniques introduced, metaphor and symbolism stand out as particularly useful due to their ability to convey complex ideas and emotions succinctly and powerfully. Metaphors allow writers to draw connections between seemingly unrelated concepts, creating vivid imagery and deeper understanding for the reader. For instance, comparing life to a journey can encapsulate the idea of progress and discovery, enriching the narrative with layers of meaning. Symbolism, similarly, imbues objects, characters, or events with additional significance, allowing writers to communicate themes and motifs subtly. This technique can elevate writing by engaging readers in deciphering hidden meanings, thus making the experience more interactive and thought-provoking.\n\nAdditionally, questioning and focused free writing are invaluable for idea generation and overcoming writer’s block. Questioning prompts writers to delve into the “why” and “how” of their subject, encouraging deeper exploration and critical thinking. Focused free writing offers a structured approach to brainstorming, enabling writers to channel their thoughts in a specific direction while maintaining creative flow. By combining these techniques, writers can develop rich, nuanced content that resonates with their audience, making them essential tools in any writer’s toolkit.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.\n\n\n", "task_id": "f78e1e91-5009-4533-a737-54c9aa0c5353", "level_title": "Law", "label": 5}

Write back to them about the state of the industry in your country, or internationally, it's up to you. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: The internet has become an integral part of the telecommunications industry as voice and data networks converge. ISPs are the companies that make it possible for people to go online. They provide services like internet transit, domain name registration and hosting, software and leased line access and collocation. Recently the stock market for the telecommunications and IT-related industries has seen a downturn, causing many ISPs to face restructuring, takeovers and mergers. \nToday I'd like to talk about telecommunication mergers and introduce some factors that are critical to their success. In the last few years, therehas been a wave of mergersin the communications field. Deregulation and technological innovationhave spurred growth in new services and are intensifying competition in nearly every product area.\nConvergence between computing and telecommunicationshas finally taken hold, enabled by the Internet as the emerging backbone for a global, networked economy.Ongoing research by my company reveals that since the mid-1980s, most large mergers and acquisitions (deals worth more than $500 million) resulted in poor returns to shareholders over the following three years, relative to industry averages.\nSuccessful mergers depend on creating new business designs that can capture the industry's future value growth, and not simply expanding the firms' current business designs.\nThe telecommunications industry, like many others,shows an increasing trend toward 'winner take all' battles, where the player with the superior business design reaps the highest share of the profits.

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Although advances in robotics are the favourite topic of conversation amongst the media, these seem to be a rare sight in most nations of Latin America. Third world countries can only get their grasp on the crumbs that the rest of the world gets rid of once they find a shinier machine to focus on. \n\nThat being said, even with such scarce resources, technological innovations accomplish to reach Latin-Americans through unexpected ways. In populations in which you may be more fixated on getting dressed and feeding your family, the local business have adapted their technology to the demand. AI can be seen in the images printed in mugs and shirts, as, to distinguish themselves, designers generate images through digital platforms that merge already existing art into a new illustration for their business. Due to the limited budget people can allocate to indulge into their hobbies, you may prefer to buy a 3D printed figure of your favourite movie character rather than opting for the official and more expensive version of this item.\n\nThis pattern seems to be evolving however, as the persons that are able to access these tools are venturing into producing items to address more important matters. 3D printed prosthetic arms, for example, allow those who need them the most to move through their day-to-day lives without breaking the bank. Softwares that mimic speech enable new connection opportunities to those with speech impediments, or even those that may speak a different language altogether. \n\nAt the end of the day, it is within the human nature to make-do with what the world gives us, and it only takes a little bit of genius to bend these opportunities and uncover the path for a better future.", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, was a landmark trade agreement that came into effect in January 1994, after years of negotiation. The agreement involved three member states: the United States, Canada, and Mexico. One of its key goals was to reduce or eliminate customs duties (tariffs) between the three nations, promoting easier and more efficient trade.\n\nNAFTA had a profound impact on trade relations, especially in sectors like agriculture. For example, Mexican fruits and vegetables began flowing more freely into the U.S. market, benefiting Mexican producers and providing American consumers with a wider variety of fresh produce. The agreement also helped integrate industries across the three countries, creating cross-border supply chains and fostering economic growth.\n\nHowever, the agreement had both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, it boosted trade and investment opportunities. On the negative side, some sectors, such as manufacturing, saw job losses due to cheaper labor and production costs in Mexico. Despite these challenges, overall, NAFTA benefited all three members by fostering closer economic ties and encouraging growth in key industries.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Zen will address this gap by offering a gourmet, health-conscious menu designed by top chefs from renowned restaurants.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility: A Necessity, Not an Option\n\nThe debate over corporate social responsibility (CSR) highlights a fundamental question: should businesses focus solely on profits, or do they owe something to society? While some argue that corporations should prioritize shareholder value, I believe CSR is not only morally justified but also strategically beneficial.  \n\nCompanies operate within societies, drawing resources, labor, and infrastructure from the communities they serve. In return, they have an ethical obligation to give back. Investing in sustainable practices, fair wages, and community development builds trust and goodwill, strengthening long-term relationships with both employees and customers. For instance, as Jack@MSU points out, companies with strong CSR records enjoy greater customer loyalty, which translates into higher profitability.  \n\nMoreover, CSR fosters innovation and resilience. Addressing environmental challenges, for example, can lead to cost savings and the development of new technologies. Businesses that integrate CSR into their strategies are better equipped to adapt to changing regulations and social expectations.  \n\nCritics argue, like theG8T, that businesses should focus solely on profit and leave societal welfare to governments. However, this perspective ignores the interconnectedness of modern economies. Governments may set regulations, but corporations have the resources and influence to drive progress faster and more effectively.  \n\nIn conclusion, CSR is not just philanthropy; it’s a long-term investment in stability and growth. By embracing social responsibility, companies can secure both public trust and financial success.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

However, recent studies have shown a change in behavior that suggests, in the future, ther will be fewer cars on the road and an increase in the use of public transport.\n\nOne reason for this change is that young professionals have become so attached to their electronic gadgets, that they are willing to give up the privilege of driving for the instant entertainment and communication. The also feel they can be more productive if the work during their commute rather than sitting in traffic wasting time.\n\nAnother factor is that the development of public transport is greener and a more convenient option.\n\nAnother industry undergoing changes is air travel, where the trend is more cost cutting with budget airlines, so they can provide the hard-up traveler with cheaper flights than ever before.\n\nSo, whats next? Maybe space tourism. There are now travel agencies that who specialize in trips into space, at least for those with enough money to pay for it. \nAnd maybe this once-in-a-lifetime adventure is not as far away as we think.", "task_id": "ff0155e4-a137-4a41-a7b2-ebeaf0213c72", "level_title": "Travel Industry", "label": 3}

The object was to find market potential and identify areas for product improvement.\nMethod:\nA total of 2,000 people were surveyed, with 1,000 participants from each city. The sample included a broad range of demographics, and respondents were asked about their approval of the collarless dress shirt and their likelihood of purchasing it.\nFindings:\nApproval and purchase intent were much higher in Shanghai (80% approved, 40% would buy) than in Rio de Janeiro (35% aproved, 20% would buy). Common reasons for dissatisfaction included issues with design, size, color, and material.\nConclusions:\nThe product is considerably more popular in Shanghai than in Rio. Key factors affecting satisfaction were insufficient market research and lack of diversity in design and execution.\nRecomendations:\nFurther research is recommended, particularly in Rio, to better understand consumer needs. Product improvements should focus on design details, sizing, color options, and materials, with special attention given to the Rio market.\n", "task_id": "c4a6991e-c330-41bd-88de-31bb25ee4bf1", "level_title": "Correspondence", "label": 4}

Whether it's starting a new job, moving to a different city, or adjusting to unexpected circumstances, change challenges us to grow and adapt. Although it can be uncomfortable at first, change often brings new opportunities and fresh perspectives.\n\nMany people resist change because it brings uncertainty. It takes us out of our comfort zones and forces us to confront the unknown. However, resisting change can hold us back from reaching our full potential. By embracing it, we open the door to personal development and transformation.\n\nTo make the most of change, it’s important to stay positive, set clear goals, and remain flexible. Accepting that not everything is within our control allows us to focus on what we can influence. Even setbacks can become stepping stones toward success when we adopt a mindset of growth.\n\nSurrounding ourselves with supportive people and taking time to reflect can also help during transitons.

Alcina refugiou-se debaixo do toldo de uma velha loja de ferragens, fechada havia muitos anos. A noite não estava convidativa mas havia sempre quem estivesse disposto a comprar felicidade falsa e prazer duvidoso.\n\nTal como o antigo patrão que a iniciara naquela vida… Uma vida perdida ou talvez não. Doutra forma estaria, aos 36 anos, rodeada de um rancho de filhos que tinha de sustentar, um marido bêbado para aturar, o gado para tratar e as terras para amanhar.\n\nParou um carro. Saiu da cobertura, aproximou-se da janela que desceu lentamente. Entre sorrisos, disparou um costumado cumprimento:\n\n- Boa noite, sortudo…\n\n- Sortudo?\n\n- Sim! Vejo que queres companhia. E estou aqui para te ajudar…\n\nAs frases eram invariavelmente as mesmas, proferidas naquele tom meloso de provocação libidinosa. Afastou-se do carro um pouco para que a apreciasse. O condutor não gostou do que viu e sem nada dizer, arrancou.\n\nMais à frente duas jovens tiveram mais sorte e entraram na viatura.\n\nAlcina nem pestanejou. Já sabia que era assim. A sua idade trazia-lhe profundos sulcos na face, que nem as camadas de base conseguiam disfarçar.\n\nTodavia o corpo parecia menos mau, assim julgava. Vestia nessa noite uma minisaia curta que mais parecia um cinto. Um top cotado e meias de renda. Por cima, um casaco comprido de um vermelho berrante mas atractivo.\n\nRegressou ao toldo e sentou-se no degrau frio e molhado. Encostou a cabeça à parede e adormeceu. Nesse sono acabou por viajar ao seu passado, umas vezes fantástico, outras nem tanto. Parecia sentir ainda o cheiro do pão acabado de cozer e outrossim do corpo gordo e mal-cheiroso do velho que a possuíra pela primeira vez. Aquele sono levou-a de regresso à sua antiga escola, onde as letras e os números a animavam. E à mãe que desejava colocar a filha a estudar mas o pai, austero e avaro, só pretendia dinheiro.\n\nSentiu um toque muito ao de leve no ombro. Acordou sobressaltada e deu de caras com um jovem rapaz que a mirava. Perguntou:\n\n- Não achas que és muito novo para andares às meninas?\n\nO jovem voluntário olhou para os colegas ao lado e sorriu. Insistiu:\n\n- Posso ajudá-la nalguma coisa?\n\nAlcina percebendo finalmente o equívoco, respondeu:\n\n- Hum, só gostava de voltar a ser feliz!\n\nTags:400 palavrasescrita\n link do post comentar favorito\ninícioseguinte »\n5 comentários\n Anónimo  08.12.2014\nlink do comentário\nresponder\ndiscussão\nImagem de perfil\n José da Xã  08.12.2014\nObrigado Paulo.

Construction is expected to take two years. We anticipate return on investment by the second operational year and annual profits of approximately $1 million from then on. Full investment recovery is projected within four years of opening.\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nWe have already accounted for potential economic downturns in our projections. Should the market remain stable, both ROI and profit timelines may be halved. A robust media campaign by Kudos Advertising Agency will ensure market awareness and early traction.

[SEP] Response: Nova Espécie de Ave Descoberta – Um Parente Próximo do Pisco-de-Peito-Ruivo-Americano\n\nTestes de DNA recentes revelaram uma nova espécie de ave que anteriormente se acreditava ser o pisco-de-peito-ruivo-americano (Turdus migratorius). Embora geneticamente relacionada, essa nova espécie identificada apresenta diferenças importantes tanto na aparência quanto no habitat.\n\nFisicamente, ela é um pouco menor que o pisco-de-peito-ruivo-americano e possui um bico visivelmente maior. A plumagem do macho tem um tom mais enferrujado, com menos vermelho no peito do que o habitual nessa outra espécie. Essas características sutis, mas consistentes, ajudam a diferenciá-la em campo.\n\nEmbora habite ambientes semelhantes, a nova espécie apresenta um comportamento diferente durante o inverno. Ao contrário do pisco-de-peito-ruivo-americano, que migra para o sul do Canadá, essa ave permanece no país durante todo o ano — uma diferença ecológica importante.\n\nUsando o sistema formal de classificação zoológica, a nova espécie é classificada da seguinte forma:\n\nReino: Animalia\n\nFilo: Chordata\n\nClasse: Aves\n\nOrdem: Passeriformes\n\nFamília: Turdidae\n\nGênero: Turdus\n\nEspécie: Turdus canadensis\n\n\nO nome sugerido, Turdus canadensis, destaca a forte associação da espécie com o Canadá, especialmente seu comportamento não migratório.

Read the information you have compiled, and make notes to prepare for the writing task. Think about how you will format and set out this information using headings, numbers, bullet points, etc.. [SEP] Response: Apart from the problems of the ongoing conflicts, there has been the constant threat of hunger for the civilians in the area. Earlier in the year the weather was unusually cold and dry, which resulted in crop failures. In recent weeks heavy rains have caused flooding and the destruction of bridges, roads and rail links, cutting off some of the most vulnerable villages.\n\nAs a result of the conflict and because of humanitarian concerns, Chapter VII of the UN Charter was invoked by a special resolution with strong rules of engagement (ROE) to impose peace, separate the warring factions and provide humanitarian care. An Implementation Phase, involving air power supported by ground troops, will be launched at 0600 hours on Monday unless the factions lay down their arms. This seems increasingly unlikely.\n\nIn addition to war-fighting the infantry units will be expected to conduct humanitarian operations, to protect people and improve basic facilities. The Implementation Phase is expected to last one month and then turn into a Stabilization Phase, although it is possible that the war fighting phase will last longer.

[SEP] Response: Hi Pete,\n\nThank you for speaking with me during our recent consultation. Based on our conversation, I’ve noted several lifestyle habits that may be affecting your health and well-being.\n\nWorking long hours and sitting at your desk all day is causing physical strain—particularly back pain—which is likely worsened by a poor-quality chair. This sedentary routine, combined with smoking, high coffee intake, and lack of sleep, is contributing to your constant fatigue and stress. Additionally, your reliance on junk food and lack of physical activity is having a negative impact on your weight and overall energy levels.\n\nTo start making changes, I recommend replacing one coffee per day with a glass of water, taking regular breaks from your desk, and considering light daily exercise such as walking or stretching. Improving your diet by including more fresh fruits and vegetables will boost your energy and mood. Lastly, cutting down on screen time before bed can greatly improve your sleep quality.\n\nSmall adjustments will lead to big improvements over time. Reducing stress, eating better, and staying active will help you feel more energized, focused, and in control of your health.\n\nLet me know if you'd like help setting goals.\n\nBest regards,\nPedro\nLife Coach", "task_id": "ea118437-9196-46db-8e48-834541d37cba", "level_title": "Society and Leisure", "label": 5}

We can also develop a mobile service where tailors visit clients at their convenience for measurements. Regular pop-up fitting events could be scheduled in various business districts or residential areas. Partnering with local businesses or coworking spaces for occasional fittings or events would be beneficial.

First, we propose pushing retirement bonus for workers who are within two years of retirement for example a year paid with benefits per two year.

In addition, we recommend using attrition next years and cutting everyone back to 37 hours a week. This would save about $200,000 a year.\n3.

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: Over the past six months, the Hang Seng Index (HSI) in Hong Kong has shown a steady upward trend, primarily driven by substantial investment from Mainland China. This influx of capital has significantly boosted the Properties and Utilities Sub-indices, which have seen dramatic increases.\n\nSix months ago, the HSI experienced a notable drop. It has begun to falter, slipping to a low of 20,956. However, since then, the index has rebounded impressively, climbing to a high of 27,499. This recovery highlights the resilience and growth potential of the Hong Kong stock market.\n\nLooking ahead, experts are optimistic about the HSI's future performance. They predict that the index will continue to rise over the next year, fueled by massive investments from other countries and strong internal demand within Hong Kong. This positive outlook suggests a promising period for investors and stakeholders in the Hong Kong financial market.", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 5}

Persuade your design team to choose one of the designs for next year’s rollout. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: In today’s fast-paced automotive market, making the right car buying decision can be like navigating a complex maze. With numerous brands, models, specifications, options, colors, packages, and prices to consider, potential car buyers often find themselves overwhelmed by choices.\n\nJATO’s recent survey of 2,500 future car buyers revealed that 29% of people would research online first when buying a new car. This is where car comparison tools can prove to be essential for securing new and repeat business on automotive websites.\n1) Streamlining decision-making process\nImagine a customer is in the market for a hatchback and they’re looking at your brand. There are many things for them to consider – from price points to specification requirements – so having the right information is crucial to support the sales journey.\n\n \n\nUsing a car comparison tool, they can effortlessly access the facts they need, compare your model offering against direct competitors and evaluate specifications side by side. From engine performance and fuel efficiency to safety features and advanced technology, they will have a comprehensive overview that highlights key advantages and differences.\n\n \n\nThis information gives customers clarity and helps to simplify the decision-making process.\n Enhancing transparency and trust\nTransparency is a cornerstone of modern business practices. By offering a car comparison tool, your brand can demonstrate its commitment to providing potential buyers with an honest and unbiased evaluation of their offerings. This fosters trust and reinforces the brand’s credibility – both crucial factors in building lasting customer relationships, recommendations, and repeat business.\n\n \n\n3) Customisation tailored to individual preferences\nCar comparison tools go beyond listing features. They allow potential buyers to explore the various options, colours, and packages available for each model. This means that a buyer can seamlessly experiment with different specifications according to their preferences, budget, and what is available in the market today.\n\n \n\nAccording to JATO’s recent research, the top options people like to add if they have remaining budget are safety features (parking sensors, lane assist etc.). Therefore, a car comparison tool that allows customers to compare safety options from multiple brands – from price to capability – can enhance the customer experience.\n\n \n\nOffering high levels of customisation and direct access to information gives the car buyer more power, ensuring that the final purchase aligns with their preferences and requirements.\n\n \n\n4) Offering a digital first experience\nThe car buying journey has previously involved extensive research, various dealership visits, and test drives. Today, car comparison tools enable brands and customers to streamline the initial research phase, saving valuable time and energy. Customers browsing your website can now conveniently access all the information they need in one place, making the process more efficient and increasing customer satisfaction.\n\n ", "task_id": "64058d7e-9b06-4ed8-9b01-5b7efb9fb3ef", "level_title": "Automotive", "label": 0}

What do you use now, and how has it changed your reading habits? Pay attention to your use of commas, colons and semicolons. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Media has dramatically transformed my life over the years: from the way I consume information to the pace at which I receive it. Initially, my primary sources of news were newspapers and television broadcasts, which provided scheduled updates and limited viewpoints. However, the advent of the internet, along with the proliferation of smartphones, has revolutionized my interaction with media. Now, I have constant, on-demand access to a vast array of resources, from online articles and videos to podcasts and social media platforms. This shift has made staying informed both more comprehensive and overwhelming; it's easy to fall into information overload. Social media, in particular, has blurred the lines between personal and public spaces, facilitating instant communication but also raising concerns about privacy and misinformation. Furthermore, the personalized algorithms on platforms like YouTube and Twitter curate content tailored to my interests, which can be both a boon and a curse; while it ensures relevancy, it can also create echo chambers that reinforce my existing beliefs. Thus, while media has undoubtedly enhanced my ability to connect with the world, it also demands a higher level of discernment to navigate it responsibly.", "task_id": "7e0827d0-955c-484a-8c4f-81fe6a574af8", "level_title": "11-Upper Intermediate", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Police and Immigration [SEP] Prompt: Ms. Smith, a member of the neighborhood watch group, has contacted your department asking for information on how to deal with domestic abuse. Write her an email summarizing the information from the SOADA flyer, and encourage her to contact the organization. [SEP] Response: We are often told to just say “no” to drugs, and that's excellent advice. Drugs have various adverse effects on individuals and society. Besides the obvious health dangers of taking drugs, there are many other ways in which drugs negatively impact our communities.\n\nMany people think that their own health is their own business, but perhaps you didn’t know that drug use also contributes to the spread of HIV. This can be caused by the sharing of drug needles, but HIV is also spread as a result of the impaired abilities of users to make good judgments. Drug users often engage in unprotected sex, which then transmits HIV to several people in a short period of time.\n\nClosely related to this is the burden that drugs have on the health care system, since so much money and resources are spent treating drug addicts, victims of drug-related violence, and others whose health is affected by the illegal drug trade.\n\nDrug use also brings about great economic losses in the community. Drug users tend to have lower productivity at work, or they miss work altogether, costing companies millions of dollars per year. Additionally, millions of dollars are spent every year fighting drug cartels and drug smugglers.\n\nAll of the fighting between drug cartels, drug smugglers, and the authorities not only results in millions of dollars in property and infrastructure damage, but also increased violent crime in our neighborhoods. Drug users are often violent as a result of the influence of drugs or the influence of their desire for them.\n\nRelated to this is the funding of militant groups that comes as a result of drug trafficking. These groups sometimes commit acts of violence and terrorism in order to establish their dominance and take control of the drug trafficking industry.\n\nFinally, even when we do capture those responsible for selling or importing drugs, the justice system becomes burdened as a result of having to deal with the perpetrators of drug-related crimes.
