Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Dear Harry,\n\nCongratulations for your promotion as a Manager.\n\nOne of the most important aspect of being a successful Manager is to have a high performance team.\n\nIn this sense, it is important to have the team motivated. A motivated team is a group that normally produces much more than a demotivated team. Also when you motivate a team it is willing to reach higher standards of quality. Consequently, the company benefits from motivated teams. Additionally, there are also clear benefits for each team member because when an individual has a good performance and a high level of excellence in the services or products where he is involved of his professional career will be enhanced by these skills giving him more opportunities to move forward for reaching a promotion.\n\nBut how can you have a team motivated? There are some key aspects to have into account:\n\n- Listen every team member of your team carefully. If each one realize that you are listening honestly and sympathetically to them then you will build trust on your team.\n\n- Work with your team on a collaborative way. It is not a micromanagement format it is all about how to help them to reach higher goals with your support.\n\n- Recognise their goals in public and reward them. It is not needed to give them more money, sometimes it would be enough with some extra days off, other times a costly and customized training would be more valuable from their perspective to feel rewarded.\n\n- Avoid things like: be angry, don’t praise people when they deserve. If you do these things make sure that you will have a demotivated team.\n\nGood luck with the challenge of having a motivated team.\n [SEP] Correction: <input>Dear Harry,\n\nCongratulations <code a=\"PREP\" c=\"on\">for</code> your promotion <code a=\"PREP\" c=\"to\">as</code> <code a=\"DET\" c=\"\">a </code>Manager.\n\nOne of the most important <code a=\"NOUN:NUM\" c=\"aspects\">aspect</code> of being a successful <code a=\"ORTH\" c=\"manager\">Manager</code> is <code a=\"VERB:FORM\" c=\"having\">to have</code> a high<code a=\"PUNCT\" c=\"-\"></code>performance team.<code a=\"PHRA\" c=\" \">\n\n</code>In this sense, it is important to <code a=\"VERB\" c=\"keep\">have</code> the team motivated.

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, metaphor, symbolism, and questioning stand out as the most useful to me. Metaphor allows for vivid comparisons that breathe life into writing, helping readers connect abstract ideas to tangible imagery. Symbolism, on the other hand, enriches writing by layering deeper meanings beneath the surface, making narratives more engaging and thought-provoking. These techniques are particularly valuable in creative writing, where emotional depth and layered interpretations enhance storytelling.\nAdditionally, questioning serves as a powerful tool to develop ideas and encourage critical thinking. By asking \"what if\" or \"why,\" writers can push their thoughts further, uncovering fresh perspectives and unexpected angles. This technique is incredibly effective when brainstorming or refining arguments in analytical writing. While free writing and loop writing help generate ideas freely, structured techniques like listing and cubing provide organization, making them useful for planning essays or breaking down complex topics.\nEach technique has its own strengths, but the most effective ones depend on the writing purpose and style.\n [SEP] Correction: <input>Among the nine writing techniques introduced, metaphor, symbolism, and questioning stand out as the most useful to me.

Daphne adores the way he tells their love story, but their life together comes to a screeching halt when he realizes he’s in love with his childhood best friend Petra.\n\nDaphne moves in with Petra’s ex fiance, Miles, so Petra and Peter can move in together, leaving Daphne and Miles to put their lives back together.

For example, Miles is neighborly and knows everyone in town while Daphne’s coworkers think she’s a secret agent since no one knows anything about her life. \n\nThey do their best to coexist and avoid each other in the apartment, but eventually start to form a friendship due to their close quarters. Begrudgingly, Daphne agrees to let Miles show her around town, with a countdown to her eagerly awaited Read-A-Thon (the only thing keeping her in Waning Bay) and an unexpected plan to deceive their exes.\n\nDaphne’s job as a librarian means several book references throughout the story, which warms my bookish heart. From a Station Eleven reference to alluding to the author characters from Henry’s Beach Read, these references are a bonus to help the reader illustrate Daphne’s personality based on her literary favorites. \n\nBoth Daphne and Miles are surprised by unexpected visitors, which brings some bumps in the road for their relationship – and a full apartment which presents its own challenges.

[SEP] Response: In my nation, the process of purchasing a property and submitting an application for a home loan can be both thrilling and difficult. Finding a house that suits your needs and budget is the first step. Rising property costs in recent years have made it more challenging for first-time buyers to enter the market, particularly in cities. Although property prices vary widely by region, housing has generally become more expensive with few possibilities for reasonably priced residences.\nAfter you've located a property, you must fill out a number of forms in order to apply for a house loan. A lot of paperwork, including proof of income, employment history, credit ratings, and other financial data, must be provided during this lengthy procedure. A down payment may also be required by lenders, which can be a major obstacle for some purchasers. For a normal house loan, interest rates are usually between 4 and 6%, though they might vary depending on the state of the economy.\n\nAlthough using a mortgage broker or real estate agent is not necessary, many consumers decide to do so in order to negotiate with lenders and handle the complicated paperwork. While a real estate agent can help you find the ideal property, a mortgage broker can help you get the finest loan conditions.

[SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become an integral part of modern business practices, reflecting a company's commitment to ethical behavior, sustainable development, and community engagement. The postings on this topic reveal a spectrum of opinions, ranging from enthusiastic support to skeptical criticism.\n\nProponents argue that CSR initiatives foster a positive public image, enhance customer loyalty, and attract top talent.

These businesses have successfully integrated environmental stewardship and social equity into their core operations, proving that CSR can be a win-win strategy for both the company and society.\n\nCritics, however, contend that CSR is often a facade, a marketing gimmick designed to distract from less savory business practices. They point to instances where companies engage in \"greenwashing,\" promoting environmentally friendly initiatives while continuing harmful practices behind the scenes. This skepticism underscores the need for transparency and accountability in CSR efforts.\n\nIn my view, CSR is not just a moral imperative but a strategic necessity in today's interconnected world.

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language is a rewarding yet challenging experience. Many language learners face common issues that can hinder their progress. One of the most significant challenges is motivation. Consistency is key in language learning, but maintaining interest over time can be difficult, especially when progress seems slow or when faced with the complexities of grammar and pronunciation.\n\nAnother issue is the fear of making mistakes. Many learners hesitate to speak because they fear they will sound incorrect or be misunderstood. This fear can lead to a lack of practice, which, in turn, slows down improvement. Overcoming this fear requires a shift in mindset, focusing on communication rather than perfection.\n\nAdditionally, the learning environment plays a crucial role. Without immersion or constant exposure to the language, learners may struggle to retain vocabulary or develop fluency. This can be particularly challenging for those who do not live in a country where the language is spoken. Language learners must be creative in finding ways to surround themselves with the language, such as through movies, music, or online conversations with native speakers.\n\nLastly, differences in cultural context can be a barrier. Understanding the culture behind a language is essential for full comprehension and communication. Without this understanding, learners might miss out on nuances or idiomatic expressions that are crucial for mastering a language.\n\nBy addressing these challenges, learners can improve their language skills and stay motivated throughout the journey.\n\n\n [SEP] Correction: <input>Learning a new language is a rewarding yet challenging experience.

[SEP] Response: Hang Seng Index: A Volatile Yet Resilient Performance Amid Global Headwinds\n\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI) has experienced a turbulent performance in recent months, reflecting the broader uncertainty in global financial markets. The index, which tracks the largest and most liquid companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has seen a rollercoaster of activity as investors navigate persistent global headwinds, including inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, and China's economic slowdown.\n\nDespite starting the year on a strong note, HSI faced a sharp sell-off in Q2, driven primarily by regulatory challenges in the tech sector and concerns over property developers' liquidity issues. However, the index has shown resilience in Q3, bouncing back as investor sentiment improved following the Chinese government’s recent stimulus measures and easing of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nThe technology sector, a key component of the index, remains a significant driver of volatility, with companies like Tencent and Alibaba fluctuating in response to both market conditions and regulatory shifts.

The process can be both exciting and challenging, depending on various factors such as location, market conditions, and individual financial circumstances.\n\nFirstly, housing prices vary widely across the country, with metropolitan areas like New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles being particularly expensive. Conversely, regions in the Midwest and South often offer more affordable options. As of 2023, the median home price in the U.S. is around $400,000, but this can fluctuate based on the local market.\n\nApplying for a home loan typically involves a detailed process with several forms and documentation requirements. Prospective buyers must provide proof of income, credit history, employment verification, and details about any existing debts. Lenders use this information to assess creditworthiness and determine loan eligibility. Interest rates for mortgages can vary, influenced by the Federal Reserve's policies and economic conditions. As of late 2023, average interest rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage hover around 6-7%, though this can change.\n\nUsing a real estate agent is advisable for navigating the complex home-buying process and for access to market insights and negotiation expertise. A mortgage broker can also be helpful in finding suitable loan options tailored to individual needs. However, handling the process independently is possible for those who prefer a more hands-on approach and have prior experience.\n\nOverall, while buying a home involves considerable paperwork and financial scrutiny, preparation and professional assistance can simplify the process.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, metaphor and symbolism stand out as particularly useful to me. Metaphors allow for vivid and imaginative comparisons, making abstract concepts more relatable and engaging. For instance, describing time as a \"thief\" can evoke a strong emotional response and convey the fleeting nature of moments. This technique enriches writing by adding layers of meaning and enhancing the reader's experience.\n\nSymbolism, on the other hand, imbues objects, characters, or events with deeper significance, often reflecting broader themes. This technique can subtly guide the reader to uncover hidden messages and insights within the text. For example, using a storm to symbolize turmoil or a rose to represent love can create powerful imagery and resonance.\n\nFocused free writing is another valuable technique, as it encourages the flow of ideas without the constraints of structure or perfection. This method can help overcome writer's block and generate raw, authentic content that can later be refined.\n\nOverall, these techniques—metaphor, symbolism, and focused free writing—are instrumental in crafting compelling narratives that captivate and provoke thought, making them indispensable tools in my writing arsenal.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the introduced techniques, free writing and loop writing appear most useful. Free writing allows for a spontaneous and unfettered exploration of ideas, overcoming writer's block and fostering creativity. Loop writing builds upon this by providing a structured framework to refine and develop those initial ideas into coherent narratives. This combination of spontaneity and structure makes it a powerful tool for brainstorming and developing a piece of writing. \nListing and questioning are also valuable, as they provide a means to organize thoughts and explore different facets of a topic. Listing helps in creating a comprehensive overview, while questioning encourages deeper reflection and analysis. These techniques are particularly helpful for organizing thoughts before drafting a piece and for ensuring that all relevant aspects of a topic are considered.\n\nmany different approaches of teaching these organizational and critical skills with freewriting. Peter Elbow and Lynn Hammond both use freewriting in their classes in similar manners. Elbow went through three bouts of teaching before settling on the style he uses today. The first bout occurred during his graduate year at M.I.T. where he \"simply tried to imitate the good teachers (he had) had—to be Socrates and a good guy at the same time\" (Embracing Contraries 67). After teaching in this manner for five years, he went through a \"why should I tell them anything if they don't ask me questions\" stage, in which he taught his classes (sophomore level) based on a three step system.

While fame may stem from genuine talent or accomplishment, the nature of modern celebrity often emphasizes superficial qualities over substance. Celebrities, at times, are placed on pedestals based solely on their curated online personas, rather than on meaningful contributions to society. This can create unrealistic ideals that influence public perception, especially among younger audiences, encouraging materialism and unattainable beauty standards.\nFurthermore, the media’s relentless focus on the private lives of celebrities perpetuates a culture that values voyeurism over genuine engagement.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: For CSR\nCSR is an integral responsibility of all companies now-a -days since they have a big impact on society. A critic claims that companies should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\nAnother critic cites that the reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\nAdditionally, as an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nWhile CSR is considered as an integral part, the problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\nFurther, It's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public.

Last time they tried to reach out to her, she yelled them and said nasty things. At the beginning of her career she was very kind and considerate with the media, paparazzies and fans, but as her fame grew, she became more exclusive and avoided all media. She does not want to sign an autograph neither. And if we are honest most of the success of celebrities are due to the faithful fans and also the media viralization.

NAFTA’s primary objective was to reduce or eliminate customs duties among the member states, thereby fostering increased trade and economic cooperation.\n\nNAFTA has significantly impacted trade relations, especially in the agricultural sector.

The agreement has had both positive and negative effects on its members. While it has boosted trade and economic growth, it has also faced criticism for contributing to job losses in certain industries and raising environmental concerns.\n\nDespite these challenges, NAFTA has overall been beneficial to all three member countries, enhancing economic integration and cooperation across North America.

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Motivating employees requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Start by offering meaningful incentives that connect their personal success to the company’s achievements. When employees feel that their hard work contributes to something bigger—and that they’ll be rewarded for it—they’re more likely to stay engaged. Supporting their career growth through training opportunities and mentorship shows that you’re invested in their future, not just their output. Encouraging a healthy work-life balance and listening to their concerns also builds trust and loyalty. Equally important is how you treat your team: respect, fairness, and recognition go a long way. On the flip side, certain behaviors can quickly demotivate staff. Disrespecting subordinates, taking credit for their work, losing your temper, unfairly shifting blame, or failing to acknowledge good performance can all damage morale. Leaders who avoid these pitfalls and lead with empathy and integrity create a more motivated, productive, and loyal team.

[SEP] Response: Robots are being increasingly used in various sectors in my country, from healthcare to manufacturing and even service industries.

On the positive side, robots can take on tasks that are hazardous to humans, improve productivity, and allow for advancements in medicine and technology. They could also provide solutions to labor shortages and assist in eldercare, as they are increasingly designed to offer companionship and support. However, the rise of robots also poses challenges, such as job displacement, especially in manual labor sectors, and the potential for increased social isolation. The key will be finding a balance between harnessing the benefits of robots and addressing their societal impacts responsibly.

On the positive side, robots can take on <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"\">tasks that are </code>hazardous <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"tasks for\">to</code> humans, improve productivity, and allow for advancements in medicine and technology. They could also provide solutions to labor shortages and assist in eldercare, as they are increasingly designed to offer companionship and support. However, the rise of robots also poses challenges, such as job displacement, especially in manual labor sectors, and the potential for increased social isolation. The key will be finding a balance between harnessing the benefits of robots and addressing their societal impacts responsibly.</input>", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Last weekend, my imaginary friend Alex and I embarked on an unusual adventure that still has me chuckling. We decided to spend the day exploring the old, abandoned amusement park just outside town. As we approached the rusting gates, Alex, with his ever-curious nature, insisted on checking out the haunted house first.\n\nDespite my initial hesitation, Alex's enthusiasm was contagious. As we crept inside, the floorboards creaked under our steps, echoing through the dusty corridors. Suddenly, a gust of wind slammed a door shut behind us, and we both jumped, laughing nervously.\n\nUndeterred, Alex led the way down a narrow hallway lined with cobwebs. Just as we were beginning to feel a bit braver, a mechanical clown, long forgotten in a corner, sprang to life with a dissonant jingle.

Additionally, some criticized NAFTA for not addressing environmental and labor issues enough.\n\nIn 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which introduced updates and improvements to the deal, including better labor protections and environmental standards, aiming to modernize trade relations and address previous concerns.

[SEP] Response: Fuselage\nThe fuselage is the long, narrow tube that forms the main body of the aircraft. Inside, it houses the cabin for the crew and passengers.

Raising the flaps reduces drag, allowing for smoother flight. Flaps can also be used to slow the aircraft down when necessary.\n\nTail (Fin)\nThe tail section ensures stability and controls the direction of the aircraft. The vertical stabilizer (fin) helps maintain balance from side to side, while the horizontal stabilizer controls the up-and-down movement of the nose. Pilots adjust these surfaces to maneuver the aircraft in yaw (left and right) and pitch (up and down).\n\nEngines\nThe engines generate the high power needed for propulsion.

Write 100 - 150 words. [SEP] Response: Cessna 123 experienced a go-around and multiple problems on approach to land at JFK Airport this evening, October 23, 2024. Stronger-than-expected crosswinds during final approach resulted in a loss of stability with the plane. The pilot attempted to correct the track of the aircraft and a rough landing occurred. As the Falcon ML landed, its left landing gear experienced a minor issue which made it come slightly off-center while on the ground. Thankfully all crew were uninjured and safety measures responded as normal.\n\nA post-landing inspection found that in addition to the crosswinds, a small mechanical issue with the landing gear mechanism also compounded towards a harder thump down.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 7.0 [SEP] Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is composed of several key parts, each with a specific function that ensures safe and efficient flight. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane, housing the cockpit, passengers, and cargo. It provides structural integrity and connects all other parts of the aircraft.\n\nThe wings are crucial for flight, generating lift as air flows over and under them. This lift allows the airplane to rise off the ground and stay airborne. The shape and design of the wings are essential for controlling the aircraft's stability and maneuverability.\n\nThe tail consists of the horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer helps maintain the airplane's pitch, preventing it from tipping forward or backward. The vertical stabilizer, or fin, keeps the airplane's yaw in check, preventing it from swaying side to side.\n\nFinally, the engines provide the necessary thrust to propel the airplane forward. They can be jet engines or propellers, depending on the type of aircraft. The engines' power allows the airplane to reach and maintain the desired speed and altitude.

The event lasted three days and on the last day there was a closing cocktail party. He ended up eating something that upset his stomach.

In one of the stopovers, the plane stopped for a long time to pick up passengers from another flight that was having technical problems. His nausea got worse and he started vomiting. The flight attendants tried to help by putting ice on his neck and head, but it didn't help. So, when the plane made another stopover, the captain asked him if he was fit to continue the flight. For lack of alternatives, he said he was prepared to continue his journey. Unwillingly, the captain asked the plane's crew to call an ambulance. When the ambulance arrived, he was put in it while the plane took off. It was one of the worst situations I've ever experienced, my friend said.

[SEP] Response: There are urban legends in my country. Since I was kid, I have known some creatures, but I have never see them. However, most people know these existence of creatures.I think that most these creatures have been created by people who live there. Sometimes, adults want to keep their kids stay calm and behave themselves well. They have made kids believe in monsters or ghosts and take advantages of those fairy tales to control their kids in the way they want. I have never seen one of monsters so far, but it exists in our modern lives. Sushi is one of our cuisines, they are served rice and some fish, but sometimes they are served with rice and vegetable. One of them is rice and cucumbers, and we call it “Kappa” maki, which is cucumber rolled with rich and seaweed.Where dose the term “Kappa” come from? Kappa (kappa) is a Japanese water monster. It is also called the water god, or its dependent, or its temporary form. Along with ogres and tengu, it is considered one of the most famous Japanese yokai. As related tangible relics, there are kappa shrines and kappa mounds (the same as whale mounds and tool mounds) in various places.Kappa are said to be roughly humanoid in form and about the size of a child, inhabiting the ponds and rivers of Japan. Clumsy on land, they are at home in the water and thrive during the warm months. They are typically greenish in color or yellow-blue, and either scary or slimy skinned, with webbed hands and feet, and a turtle-like carapace on their back. Inhuman traits include three anuses that allow them to pass three times as much as gas as humans. Despite their small stature they are physically stronger than a grown man.The kappa are sometimes said to smell like fish, and they can swim like them. While potentially dangerous and mischievous, they are said to be very honourable, always keeping promises and being highly intelligent.According to some accounts, a kappa's arms are connected to each other through the torso and can slide from one side to the other.  While they are primarily water creatures, they do on occasion venture onto land. They have a dish in their head which must be filled with water at all times. When they venture on land, the \"dish\" on their head can be covered with a metal cap for protection.

[SEP] Response: The free writing technique is a valuable tool for developing creativity, overcoming writers block and enhancing flow of ideas. By allowing writers to write continuously without worrying about grammar, punctuation, or structure, free writing encourages the mind to explore thoughts freely and organically.

It removes the fear of making mistakes and helps silence the inner critic, which can often hinder the creative process.\nMoreover, free writing serves as a warm-up exercise that gets the brain engaged before starting more structured writing tasks.

On the positive side, robots can enhance human capabilities and improve the quality of life, but society will need to adapt through education, reskilling programs, and new policies to ensure the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

[SEP] Response: Property and Liability Insurance Assessment \nFalling Bricks:\nThe primary hazard is the potential for loose bricks to fall, causing injury to people or damage to property.\nPotential for Falling Objects:\nOther falling objects, like debris from mortar or other materials associated with loose bricks, should also be considered.\nStructural Integrity:\nLoose bricks may indicate a broader structural issue, potentially increasing the risk of further damage. \nSeverity:\nEvaluate the potential impact of falling bricks, considering factors like:\nHeight of bricks: Higher bricks increase the potential for significant impact and injury.\nBrick material: Bricks made of heavier materials pose a higher risk.\nLocation of bricks: Bricks located near pathways, windows, or open areas increase the likelihood of someone being struck.\nCondition of bricks: Evaluate the looseness of the bricks and how long they have been loose.\nWeather conditions: Evaluate the impact of wind, rain, and temperature on the bricks.\nStructural integrity: If the wall has a history of issues, this increases the likelihood of falling bricks. \nProperty Liability Insurance:\nProperty owners are often covered for liability claims if someone is injured on their property, including injuries caused by falling bricks. \nDuty of Care:\nOwners have a duty to maintain their property and ensure it is safe for others. Failure to address loose bricks could lead to liability claims. \nNegligence:\nIf an owner knew or should have known about the loose bricks and failed to address them, they could be found liable for damages. \nWarning Signs:\nIf repairs are not feasible or immediate, warning signs can be used to alert people to the potential hazard.\nRegular Inspections:\nRegular inspections of the exterior can help identify and address loose bricks before they become a significant hazard.

The data indicated that the gear handle was positioned to the down position, and there was an error message of a fault for the nose wheel steering.  \n\nThe flight diverted to San Jose, California. The captain was asked to perform a flyby of the tower for verification on the gear status. The tower, InterStar ground personnel, and a local news helicopter advised him that the nose gear was cocked 90 degrees to the left. When he found out this information, the captain decided to divert to SFO because it had optimum field conditions, a longer runway, and a better emergency support services. The crew flew for several hours to burn fuel so that they could land at a lighter weight.\n\nThe captain advised the cabin crew that in the event that the nose gear collapsed, evacuation from the front doors was not available so everyone would deplane from the rear exits. The flight crew continually updated the cabin crew and passengers about the situation, and advised the cabin crew to prepare for emergency procedures.  \n\nThe captain flew the airplane for the landing. He touched down at 120 knots, and applied normal braking at 90 knots. He held the nose gear off of the ground as long as possible. At 60 knots, the flight crew shut down the engines. They did not use reverse thrust or auto-braking. During the landing, the forward cabin crew could smell burnt rubber. The air traffic control tower confirmed that there was no fire, and the captain announced this to the cabin crew. After this notification, the passengers deplaned normally using an air stair.\n\nUpon touchdown, the tires rapidly deflated and tore apart, and both wheels were worn into the axle. During landing, the airplane's trajectory was not affected by the abnormal configuration or subsequent tire destruction, and the airplane stayed on the runway centerline.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find focused free writing and questioning to be the most useful. Focused free writing allows me to explore a topic in depth without worrying about structure or grammar, which helps me uncover ideas I didn’t know I had. It’s especially helpful when I’m stuck or unsure how to begin a piece. By narrowing my attention to a specific subject, I can generate meaningful content while still maintaining the freedom to express myself creatively.\nQuestioning is another technique I rely on often. Asking questions like “Why does this matter?” or “What would happen if…?” helps me dig deeper into a topic and develop a stronger argument or narrative. It encourages critical thinking and helps me see different angles, which is essential for persuasive or reflective writing. While techniques like metaphor and symbolism add flair, I believe focused free writing and questioning are foundational tools that help shape the core of my ideas. They make the writing process more engaging and productive, especially during the early stages of brainstorming and drafting.\n [SEP] Correction: <input>Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find focused free writing and questioning to be the most useful.

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the various writing techniques, I find metaphor, free writing and cubing to be the most useful. Metaphors allow me to express complex or abstract ideas in more tangible terms, creating a vivid image that connects with readers on an emotional level. They help me see ideas from different angles, adding depth to my writing. For example, describing a challenging situation as 'climbing a mountain' makes the struggle feel more real and relatable. \nFree writing is anotes technique I use often. It helps me bypass any internal criticism or blocks by allowing me to write continously without worrying about structure or precision. This helps me uncover raw thoughts and ideas that I might not otherwise express. Focused free writing, where I set a specific topic or question, refiness this process, providing a loose direction while still maintaining the freedom of flow. \nCubing, whit its multiple perspectives on a topic, is useful for exploring all angles of an idea.

First of all, you need to fix the loose bricks on the top of the building, they can fall off and injure someone who walks outside the building; secondly, you do not have air conditioning that could cause to be very hot the workplace and not feasible to a place to work properly. Besides, there is poor lighting and this cause some damage for your employees and of course for your sales. Finally, I strongly recommend to move the stacked boxes because they are blocking the sprinklers and  in case of fire, they will not work properly to reduce the fire.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Read an email from your friend and give advice on some stressful problems he is having. Type in the input box. Write 100-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi Leon,\nI’m really sorry to hear how stressed you’ve been feeling lately. It seems like your work situation is causing you a lot of stress, especially with the new management. It’s really frustrating to feel like your hard work isn’t being recognized. If you haven’t already, it might help to claim your space by having an open conversation with them about the lack of acknowledgment. Sometimes, a small change in communication can provide relief, but if things don’t improve, consider whether staying there long-term is worth it. Your well-being should come first. \nAs for Tia, it’s painful when relationships go through a rough patch, especially when you thought things were going well.

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: **Challenges Faced by Language Learners**\n\nLearning a new language is an exciting but often difficult journey. Many students face common challenges that can slow their progress. One major issue is pronunciation. How can students sound more like native speakers? It often takes a lot of listening and practice to pronounce words correctly. Another problem is vocabulary retention. How can learners remember so many new words? Without regular review and use in real-life situations, words are easy to forget.\n\nGrammar is another obstacle. Many languages have complex grammar rules that differ from a student’s native language. For example, word order or verb conjugation might be confusing. Students may ask themselves: How do I know which grammar rule to use? Mistakes are common, and that can lead to frustration.\n\nConfidence is also a big challenge. Why do some students hesitate to speak? Fear of making mistakes or being judged can prevent learners from practicing out loud. Finally, finding time and motivation is not easy. How can students stay consistent in their learning? Without strong habits, it’s easy to lose focus.\n\nIn conclusion, language learning involves many challenges—pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, confidence, and motivation. However, with patience, regular practice, and a positive attitude, these difficulties can be overcome.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a landmark trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which came into effect in January 1994 after years of negotiation. The primary objective of NAFTA was to reduce or eliminate customs duties among the member countries, thereby fostering a more integrated and efficient North American market. This agreement has had a profound impact on trade relations, particularly in the agricultural sector. For example, it facilitated the seamless flow of Mexican fruits and vegetables into the U.S. market, benefiting both producers and consumers.\n\nNAFTA has been credited with boosting economic growth, creating jobs, and lowering prices for consumers across the member states. However, it has also faced criticism for contributing to job losses in certain industries, particularly manufacturing, and for its environmental impact. Despite these challenges, NAFTA has generally been seen as beneficial for all three member nations, enhancing economic integration and cooperation. Overall, NAFTA has played a crucial role in strengthening trade and economic ties among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, making it a significant milestone in the history of international trade agreements.

He has got a few quotes for property and liability insurance, but they have been very high. He asks you to do a risk assessment of the premises. Have a look at your checklist, then write him an email advising him of the changes he has to make. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi Friend,\n\nI’ve gone through the risk assessment for your secondhand clothes shop, and based on the checklist, here are a few changes you can make to help lower your property and liability insurance premiums.\n\nBuilding Condition: Since the building is old, it might be increasing your premiums. Consider investing in some basic repairs, especially for plumbing and electrical systems. Insurance companies often view buildings with outdated infrastructure as higher risks.\n\nSecurity: Installing security systems like an alarm, CCTV, and better locks will lower the risk of theft and vandalism. Many insurers offer discounts for properties with enhanced security measures.\n\nFire Safety: Adding fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, and possibly sprinklers could help reduce the risk of fire-related claims. These improvements may also make your insurance premiums more manageable.\n\nLiability Coverage: Since the building is older, consider limiting your liability coverage to match the size and layout of the premises. If possible, raise your deductible to reduce premiums.\n\nLet me know if you need help coordinating any of these changes!\n\nSohee Kim [SEP] Correction: <input>Hi Friend,\n\nI’ve gone through the risk assessment for your secondhand clothes shop, and based on the checklist, here are a few changes you can make to help lower your property and liability insurance premiums.\n\nBuilding Condition: Since the building is old, it might be increasing your premiums.

[SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into force in January 1994, after years of negotiation, creating a trilateral trade bloc between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\n Its primary aim was to reduced or eliminated customs duties among the members such as tariffs, and foster economic integration among the three nations. The NAFTA has had a profound impact on trade relations, especially in agriculture; for example, Mexican fruits and vegetables flow into the US.Additionally, NAFTA encouraged foreign direct investment, enhancing the competitiveness of industries within the bloc.\nNAFTA also faced criticism. Critics pointed to job losses in certain industries, particularly in manufacturing, due to companies relocating to Mexico for cheaper labor. Environmental concerns and the exploitation of workers were also points of contention.\nIn 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which updated key provisions to address modern trade challenges.

Write between 80 and 100 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Increasing prices or sales, seeking new funding sources (grants, donations), and reducing operational expenses through efficiency improvements, technology adoption, and strategic resource allocation.\n1. Save electricity\nPowering down unnecessary lights, appliances, and machinery after working hours or at unused areas could generate a trickle of savings. Use a timer or smart sensor to help you turn things off. Use laptops instead of desktop computers to save up to 80% electricity.  Replace old appliances with energy-efficient ones.\n\n2. Reduce waste\nReducing waste can lead to both environmental and financial improvements. You might think that the price of paper, toner, and postage is minimal, but things can add up to unexpected amounts if you are not careful. Overestimated inventory and printouts will only clutter up your office space.\n\n3. Reduce office supplies and utilities (physically and digitally)\nMany teams and departments buy similar supplies, such as conference speakerphones, and use similar online tools, such as files-sharing platforms. Reduce spending on these duplicated assets and combine purchases for greater bargaining power and cost reductions.\n\n4. Reduce service costs to align with usage\nCarefully plan your needs and capacity under your service plans, which should be reviewed regularly. To avoid paying too much, use services that offer pay-as-you-go pricing models giving you the flexibility to scale up or down according to your needs.\n5. Save travelling costs\nMost people have gotten used to virtual meetings during lockdowns. Continuing this practice with your business partners either at home, in different offices or cities for quick catch-ups could save up to 32% of day-to-day operation cost on business travels.\n\n6. Allow remote work to save on office rent\nMeme platform 9gag adapted the WFH-forever policy to save over HK$200,000 in monthly rent on its 7,000-sq-ft office in Tsuen Wan. If your business operations can be conducted remotely, consider reducing your on-premises workforce and use a smaller office or none at all.\n\n [SEP] Correction: <input>Increasing prices or sales, seeking new funding sources (grants, donations), and reducing operational expenses through efficiency improvements, technology adoption, and strategic resource allocation<code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"\">.\n1</code>.

Options: general cargo safety and stowage; staffing levels and working conditions; general condition and maintenance of the vessel; safety standards; pollution [SEP] Response: \n\nOne common problem on board a ship is poor cargo stowage, which can cause items to shift during rough seas, creating serious safety hazards. A solution is to ensure all cargo is properly secured using safety nets and locks, and to conduct regular inspections. Another issue is pollution, especially from oil leaks or waste disposal. To solve this, ships should follow strict environmental regulations, use eco-friendly systems, and train the crew in waste management.
