Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: What a crazy week it's been for me. As you know, my work has been one of my major stressors, especially with the new management. They don't seem to understand how to motivate their staff, and when we do a good job, they don't acknowledge us. I'm not sure how much longer I can work here.\nAnother valuable technique is using strong verbs. Strong verbs add dynamism and clarity to writing, making it more impactful. Instead of relying on adverbs or weak verbs, choosing precise and powerful verbs can convey actions and emotions more effectively. For example, “He sprinted to the finish line” is more vivid than “He ran quickly to the finish line.”\n\nVarying sentence structure is also crucial for maintaining reader interest and enhancing the flow of writing. Mixing short, punchy sentences with longer, more complex ones can create a rhythm that keeps readers engaged. This technique helps to emphasize key points and provides a natural pacing to the narrative.\n\nLastly, using metaphors and similes can enrich writing by drawing creative comparisons that resonate with readers. These figurative language tools can make abstract concepts more tangible and relatable. For example, describing a difficult task as “an uphill battle” immediately conveys the struggle involved.\n\nIncorporating these techniques can significantly improve the quality of writing, making it more engaging, clear, and memorable. Which writing techniques do you find most effective in your own writing?\n\n\n\n\nYou\nSent by you:\nCan you explain more about showing vs. telling?\nCopilot\nSent by Copilot:\nAbsolutely! The concept of “showing vs. telling” is a fundamental writing technique that can greatly enhance your storytelling.\n\nTelling is when you simply state facts or describe something directly. It provides information but often lacks depth and engagement. For example, “She was nervous” is telling. It gives the reader the information but doesn’t evoke much emotion or imagery.\n\nShowing, on the other hand, involves describing actions, thoughts, and sensory details to convey the same information more vividly. It allows readers to experience the scene and emotions themselves. For example, instead of saying “She was nervous,” you could show it by writing, “Her hands trembled as she fumbled with the keys, her breath quickening with each passing second.” This description helps the reader visualize the character’s nervousness and feel more connected to the scene.\n\nHere are a few tips to help you show rather than tell:\nUse sensory details: Describe what characters see, hear, smell, taste, and feel. This makes scenes more immersive.\nDescribe actions: Show characters’ emotions through their actions. For example, instead of saying “He was angry,” you could write, “He slammed his fist on the table, his face turning red.”\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 0}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find focused free writing and listing especially useful. Focused free writing allows ideas to flow naturally, but with a clear direction. It encourages creativity without overwhelming the writer with the need for perfection, while still staying on-topic. This method helps generate meaningful content quickly and often brings out deeper thoughts that may have been overlooked.\nListing, on the other hand, is great for organizing thoughts in a concise way. It simplifies complex topics into manageable pieces and often serves as a starting point for longer writing. By jotting down ideas, details, or even contrasting viewpoints, listing helps clarify structure and argument.\nSymbolism and metaphor are also powerful, particularly when trying to create emotional resonance or vivid imagery. They add layers of meaning that can elevate basic writing to something more thought-provoking. Each technique serves a distinct purpose, but the combination of spontaneity (from free writing), structure (from listing), and creativity (from metaphor and symbolism) seems to offer the most balanced and effective toolkit for a writer aiming to express ideas clearly and memorably.\n", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) recently updated the interest income figures to include 2023 data. In this note we do three things. First, we update our earlier analysis with the 2023 data. Second, we scrutinize the household sector, explaining how the interest data in the personal income report needs to be handled with care.  Third, we investigate whether the unusually large growth in government interest payments to domestic agents may have partly offset the restraint usually imposed on private activity by higher interest rates. \nThis just in… \nIn this note, we’ll first focus on monetary interest, which is the flow of dollars from borrowers to lenders. The financial corporate sector has large gross flows of interest paid and received, which are both clearly tied to the Fed cycle. Yet net interest income has remained remarkably stable", "task_id": "5949887a-c75f-46ad-95d6-9775e932a1e6", "level_title": "14-Advanced", "label": 0}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 12-Upper Intermediate [SEP] Prompt: Write about how to develop leadership qualities. You can write about personal experiences or what you have seen happen in others. What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Leadership is not something you’re born with; it’s a skill you can learn and improve. Good leaders inspire and guide others, but becoming a leader takes effort and practice. The most important leadership qualities include self-awareness, which means knowing your strengths and weaknesses, and empathy, which helps you understand and support others. Leaders also need a clear vision to set goals and adaptability to handle challenges. While not everyone may want to lead, anyone willing to work on these skills can become a leader. \nTools like SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) can help you grow. For example, by understanding your strengths, you can use them to your advantage. By recognizing your weaknesses, you can work on improving them. Opportunities, like training or new tasks, can help you practice leadership, while being aware of challenges allows you to plan ahead. Another useful tool is the SMART goal method (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). For instance, you might set a goal like, “Improve teamwork by leading one project in the next three months and getting feedback from the team afterward.” \nDeveloping leadership skills is about learning and growing step by step.

This is a non-graded activity. [SEP] Response: NTASIA – Background Information for Deploying Units\n\nThe situation in the Federation of Pantasia began to cause the international community concern a year ago when an election resulted in a vote to break up the federation and form two separate countries for its two main ethnic groups, the Alphas and the Betas. Fighting broke out for control of the mineral-rich Argos Region, as well as between certain minority groups who were made refugees. There is also evidence of an attempt at ethnic cleansing of a minority group.\n\nSix months ago the military staged a coup to reunite the Federation. Although a large portion of the armed forces have returned to Federal control, elements have remained loyal to the new governments of Alpha and Beta. These armies have had small battles between themselves over disputed territories while resisting operations by the Federal forces based in Federal Territory.\n\nUntil a month ago the situation was a stalemate, however, the various factions have been rearming under the pretence of negotiations. Recently, strong leadership in Beta has resulted in a campaign that has pinned down Federal forces and Beta forces have also launched an all-out attack through Alpha territory to seize valuable land in Argos.\n\nThis has resulted in considerable civilian casualties, refugees and dislocation of population. There are reports of executions, rape, destruction of property and infrastructure.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Certainly! Here's a 200-line, single-paragraph narrative-style description of the **Nāga**, a legendary creature revered across India, particularly rich in Tamil and South Indian lore:\n\n---\n\nDeep within the folds of ancient forests, coiled beneath sacred fig trees, and gliding silently through underground rivers unseen by mortal eyes, the Nāga slumbers—a creature woven from myth and memory, both feared and revered throughout the ages. Neither fully beast nor god, the Nāga is a divine serpent with glistening scales of emerald and obsidian, eyes that shimmer like twin galaxies, and a forked tongue that whispers the forgotten stories of creation. Born of sage Kashyapa and the celestial mother Kadru, it slithered into the cosmic stage long before men carved kingdoms or scribes inked legends. The Nāga is elemental—a guardian of waters, storms, and subterranean treasures, its breath said to summon rainfall, its wrath to dry up rivers. In South Indian tradition, particularly in the verdant lands of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, serpent worship has endured for millennia, where stone idols of the Nāga curl beneath banyan roots and temple groves become serpentariums alive with folklore and rituals. Ancient poets once claimed that the Nāga dances in lightning and slumbers in thunder, that its venom could heal or kill, depending on the soul it faces. The Nāga is not simply one being but a race—Shesha, the cosmic bed of Lord Vishnu, who holds the planets upon his endless coils; Vasuki, whose body was wound around Mount Mandara during the churning of the ocean; and Takshaka, whose vengeance scorched the legacy of kings. These serpents are not monsters but divine enigmas—sometimes saviors, sometimes punishers—testing the virtue of those who approach them with arrogance or devotion. In temple festivals, villagers carry images of the Nāga across paddy fields as offerings are made for fertility, good harvest, and protection from calamities. Women, especially, whisper prayers to these guardians for children, for peace in marriage, and for serenity in the household. Across Tamil literature and Siddha traditions, the Nāga is a bridge between worlds, its spiral a symbol of energy rising through the spine, awakening dormant consciousness. In tales of Paambati Siddhar, one of the 18 great Siddhars of Tamil Nadu, it is said that the Nāga revealed ancient secrets of alchemy and eternal life. Even today, in quiet corners of the countryside, people tie bits of silk around anthills believed to be snake homes, speak to the earth in reverence, and sprinkle milk in hollows where nothing stirs. The Nāga, in all its mystique, remains a symbol of balance between destruction and renewal—a creature of the shadow and the sun. It glides not just through caves and rivers but through the subconscious, whispering of inner power, of the coiled serpent energy waiting to awaken. Children are taught to respect it, artists still carve its shape on temple gopurams, and mystics meditate upon its image to transcend the physical world. Through every story, from the Himalayan shrines to the Tamil heartlands, the Nāga stretches through time, never forgotten, always watching—a silent sentinel of lore, destiny, and sacred depth.\n\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Any house can be renovated, but whether it’s worth doing or not is the question. In addition to the items you’ve listed, it probably has some termite/pest work needed, might need foundation work, roofing, etc. Since it still has the original galvanized pipes then you’re also looking at redoing the kitchen and bath(s) in addition to replacing the pipes.

[SEP] Response: Flight Report\n\nOn June 13, 2010, at 1818 Pacific Daylight Time, InterStar Airways Flight 293, landed at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), San Francisco, California, with the nose wheels cocked at 90 degrees. InterStar Airways was operating the airplane as a scheduled domestic passenger flight. The captain, first officer, four flight attendants, and 141 passengers were not injured. The flight departed Oakland, California, at 1531 as a non-stop to Sky Harbor International Airport, Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nThe captain noted no problems during the initial departure, and observed a positive rate of climb. The flight crew noted an error message displayed on the control board. There was a fault message for a nose landing gear shock absorber.  The data indicated that the gear handle was positioned to the down position, and there was an error message of a fault for the nose wheel steering.  \n\nThe flight diverted to San Jose, California. The captain was asked to perform a flyby of the tower for verification on the gear status. The tower, InterStar ground personnel, and a local news helicopter advised him that the nose gear was cocked 90 degrees to the left. When he found out this information, the captain decided to divert to SFO because it had optimum field conditions, a longer runway, and a better emergency support services. The crew flew for several hours to burn fuel so that they could land at a lighter weight.\n\nThe captain advised the cabin crew that in the event that the nose gear collapsed, evacuation from the front doors was not available so everyone would deplane from the rear exits. The flight crew continually updated the cabin crew and passengers about the situation, and advised the cabin crew to prepare for emergency procedures.  \n\nThe captain flew the airplane for the landing. He touched down at 120 knots, and applied normal braking at 90 knots. He held the nose gear off of the ground as long as possible. At 60 knots, the flight crew shut down the engines. They did not use reverse thrust or auto-braking. During the landing, the forward cabin crew could smell burnt rubber. The air traffic control tower confirmed that there was no fire, and the captain announced this to the cabin crew. After this notification, the passengers deplaned normally using an air stair.\n\nUpon touchdown, the tires rapidly deflated and tore apart, and both wheels were worn into the axle. During landing, the airplane's trajectory was not affected by the abnormal configuration or subsequent tire destruction, and the airplane stayed on the runway centerline.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The concept of \"celebrity\" itself, rather than any single individual, warrants significant criticism for its pervasive and often detrimental influence on society. Modern celebrity culture frequently promotes an unrealistic and superficial standard of success, equating worth with wealth, fame, and aesthetic perfection. This can lead to widespread dissatisfaction and mental health issues among the general public, who are constantly bombarded with curated images of seemingly flawless lives.\n\nFurthermore, the relentless media scrutiny and public obsession with celebrities often trivializes genuine achievements while elevating fleeting trends or scandalous behaviors. We witness a disproportionate amount of attention given to personal lives, fashion choices, or controversies, rather than the artistic contributions or philanthropic efforts that might benefit society. This focus on the superficial distracts from more pressing global issues and can foster a culture of passive consumption rather than active engagement. The constant need for validation and the loss of privacy experienced by celebrities themselves also highlight the inherent toxicity of this system. Ultimately, the idolization of celebrity can erode critical thinking and replace substantive values with fleeting glamour.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home in India is a major life decision and involves a lengthy and sometimes complex process. First, one must decide on the location and budget. Housing prices vary significantly across the country. In metro cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore, real estate is extremely expensive, while smaller cities and towns offer more affordable options.\n\nApplying for a home loan requires various documents, including proof of identity, Income, address, and property details. Banks and housing finance companies often request salary slips, bank statements, PAN cards, and employment proof. Though the process has become more streamlined with digital platforms, it can still be time-consuming due to verifications and paperwork.\n\nInterest rates in India vary depending on the bank and the applicant's credit profile. As of now, the average home loan interest rate ranges between 8% and 10%. Many people use areal estate agent or broker to find suitable properties and handle negotiations, although it's not mandatory. For loans, some also use mortgage advisors who help compare offers from various lenders.\n\nOverall, while the process is manageable with the right guidance, it can feel overwhelming for first-time buyers. However, government schemes like PMAY(Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana) provides subsidies that help make housing more affordable for middle-and lower-income families.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

I’ve reviewed the situation, and I understand why your insurance quotes are high. Several risks need addressing to lower your premiums and ensure safety.\n\nExterior risks include loose bricks and a leaky roof, both of which could cause injury or water damage. Blocked drainpipes and a cluttered sidewalk also raise liability concerns, especially in wet weather. Cleaning up the yard and ensuring clear access paths would help.\n\nInside, poor lighting increases the risk of accidents, especially with stacked boxes creating trip hazards.

[SEP] Response: Technology vs. Challenges\nFor those vessels that venture into poorly charted or uncharted waters, of course, 3D Forward Looking Sonar (FLS) technology is a valuable tool for them to have. However, the Argos 3D FLS technology can also provide great value for mariners with less exotic itineraries.\n\nTechnology can help minimize many navigation challenges all vessels face, but there are limitations. Some standard navigation technology is at times unreliable including GPS. The shipping industry is transporting goods across oceans in this global economy, and accidents are inadvertently littering our waterways with containers that are hiding under the surface. Chart data is oftentimes inaccurate or spotty thanks to mother nature and the sheer vastness of our oceans and waterways.\nHere we highlight some of these types of challenging situations, based on recent maritime events or advisories. It is clear the use of 3D FLS could assist operators in navigating allowing for maximum safety. Particularly the Argos systems would be invaluable with its real-time data capabilities.", "task_id": "c3c051c5-08c1-4dd2-ae95-04880b5f0dc5", "level_title": "Maritime", "label": 5}

This sudden change created a range of logistical issues. Aircraft deployed to incorrect locations, resulting in leaflets being dropped in unintended areas. This miscommunication led to confusion among both civilians and troops involved in the exercise, who expressed frustration and dissatisfaction with the mistakes made.\n\nThe situation became even more serious when the host nation and official observers raised concerns about the content and language of the leaflets. The language used in the leaflets was deemed offensive and inappropriate, leading to formal protests from the host nation and various officials. These issues highlighted significant oversights in planning and coordination.\n\nFollowing the exercise, tensions heightened as some civilian observers became involved in a violent altercation over the incident, further complicating the diplomatic atmosphere. This led to additional diplomatic protests, which placed strain on the relationships between the parties involved.

[SEP] Response: Issues and Challenges Language Students Often Face\n\nWhy is learning a new language difficult for many students? One major challenge is mastering pronunciation and listening skills. Different sounds, accents, and speech speeds can confuse learners, especially when they differ significantly from their native language.\n\nAnother issue is vocabulary retention. How can students remember hundreds or thousands of new words? Without regular practice, new vocabulary is quickly forgotten. Grammar rules add another layer of complexity. Why are grammar rules so frustrating? Because they often include many exceptions and may not match the student’s native language structure.\n\nWhat about confidence? Many students fear making mistakes in front of others. This fear of embarrassment can stop them from speaking, even if they know the correct words. Motivation is another challenge. Why do some students give up? Progress may seem slow, especially without immediate rewards or real-life practice.\n\nFinally, lack of exposure is a common problem. Without daily interaction in the language, it’s hard to develop fluency. Watching shows, talking to native speakers, or traveling can help—but not everyone has those opportunities.\n\nIn summary, language learners face difficulties with pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, confidence, motivation, and exposure. Overcoming these requires consistent practice, patience, and the right learning environment.\n", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: Hang Seng Index: A Rollercoaster Ride\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI), a benchmark for the Hong Kong stock market, has experienced a turbulent year, mirroring the global economic landscape. The index has seen both significant gains and steep declines, reflecting the impact of various factors on investor sentiment.\nThe year began with a surge in the HSI, driven by optimism surrounding China's economic recovery and easing Covid-19 restrictions. However, this momentum was short-lived as geopolitical tensions, rising interest rates, and concerns about global inflation weighed on investor confidence. The index experienced a sharp correction, erasing much of its earlier gains.\nDespite the volatility, the HSI has shown resilience, demonstrating its ability to rebound from setbacks. The index has been supported by strong corporate earnings, particularly from technology and financial sectors. Additionally, government measures aimed at stimulating economic growth have provided a degree of stability.\nLooking ahead, the HSI faces both challenges and opportunities. The ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and the potential for further interest rate hikes pose risks to the market. However, China's economic reopening and the continued growth of its technology sector could provide tailwinds for the index.\nIn conclusion, the Hang Seng Index has had a volatile year, reflecting the complex and dynamic nature of the global economy. While challenges remain, the index's resilience and underlying fundamentals suggest that it has the potential for further growth in the long term.", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 5}

Fighting broke out for control of the mineral-rich Argos Region, as well as between certain minority groups who were made refugees. There is also evidence of an attempt at ethnic cleansing of a minority group.\n\nSix months ago the military staged a coup to reunite the Federation. Although a large portion of the armed forces have returned to Federal control, elements have remained loyal to the new governments of Alpha and Beta. These armies have had small battles between themselves over disputed territories while resisting operations by the Federal forces based in Federal Territory.\n\nUntil a month ago the situation was a stalemate, however, the various factions have been rearming under the pretence of negotiations. Recently, strong leadership in Beta has resulted in a campaign that has pinned down Federal forces and Beta forces have also launched an all-out attack through Alpha territory to seize valuable land in Argos.\n\nThis has resulted in considerable civilian casualties, refugees and dislocation of population.

[SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, focused free writing and questioning seem particularly useful. Focused free writing allows for the exploration of ideas within a specific topic, helping to generate content without the constraints of structure or perfection. This technique is invaluable for overcoming writer's block and discovering new angles on a subject.\n\nQuestioning, on the other hand, is a powerful tool for deepening understanding and expanding on ideas. By asking who, what, where, when, why, and how, writers can uncover details and perspectives that might otherwise be overlooked. This technique encourages critical thinking and can lead to more comprehensive and engaging writing.\n\nCombining these techniques can be especially effective. Starting with focused free writing to brainstorm ideas and then using questioning to refine and expand on those ideas can result in well-rounded and insightful content.

[SEP] Response: Developing leadership qualities takes time, self-awareness, and a willingness to grow. One of the most important qualities in a leader is the ability to listen—really listen—to others. I’ve seen people become great leaders simply because they took the time to understand their team’s concerns and needs. Another key quality is responsibility. A true leader takes ownership of their actions and decisions, even when things go wrong.\n\nConfidence is also important, but it should come with humility. Some of the most respected leaders I know admit when they don’t know something and ask for help. I’ve personally grown as a leader by stepping out of my comfort zone, learning from mistakes, and being open to feedback.\nI believe everyone has the potential to be a leader in some area of life.

Keeping the sidewalk clear is important to prevent trip-and-fall accidents that could lead to expensive liability claims.\n\nInside, the lighting is poor, which makes it harder to see hazards and increases the risk of accidents. Improving it will help keep people safe and create a better shopping environment. Also, make sure any stacked boxes are stable and that chemicals are stored safely, away from clothing and customers. Finally, replace or service the old fire extinguishers to meet fire safety requirements.\n\nSorting these issues out will make the shop much safer and should help you get cheaper insurance quotes. Let me know if you want help prioritizing the work.\n\nGood luck!\nManuel", "task_id": "9e54df01-235a-418f-9836-724a7d2eda5e", "level_title": "Insurance", "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a trilateral trade pact between the United States, Canada, and Mexico that came into effect on January 1, 1994. Its primary goal was to eliminate barriers to trade and investment among the three countries, creating one of the world's largest free-trade zones.\n\nNAFTA reduced or removed tariffs on a wide range of goods and services, from agricultural products to automobiles, promoting economic integration. It also introduced measures to protect intellectual property, establish dispute-resolution mechanisms, and set labor and environmental standards.\n\nThe agreement significantly boosted trade among the three nations, increasing cross-border economic activity and fostering cooperation. However, it also faced criticism. While proponents highlighted the economic benefits, such as lower consumer prices and job creation in certain sectors, critics pointed to the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs, particularly from the U.S. to Mexico, and concerns over environmental degradation.\n\nNAFTA remained in effect until July 1, 2020, when it was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which updated and modernized several provisions to address 21st-century trade challenges.\n\nDespite its controversies, NAFTA played a pivotal role in shaping North American trade relations and global economic dynamics for over two decades.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: he North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a landmark trade accord between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which came into effect in January 1994 after years of negotiation. Its primary goal was to eliminate or significantly reduce customs duties and trade barriers among the three member countries, thereby promoting free trade and economic integration across North America.\n\nNAFTA had a profound impact on trade relations, particularly in sectors like agriculture. For example, it facilitated the large-scale export of Mexican fruits and vegetables to the U.S., enhancing food availability and lowering prices. The agreement also encouraged cross-border investments and the development of integrated supply chains, especially in manufacturing and automotive industries.\n\nHowever, NAFTA’s effects were not uniformly positive. While it boosted overall trade and economic growth, it also led to job displacements in certain industries, particularly in manufacturing sectors in the U.S. and Canada. In Mexico, small-scale farmers faced increased competition from subsidized U.S. agricultural products.\n\nDespite these challenges, NAFTA is widely regarded as beneficial to all three countries, laying the foundation for deeper economic cooperation. It was eventually replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2020, which updated and modernized many of its provisions.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In India, robots are increasingly being integrated into various sectors, revolutionizing the way tasks are performed. In manufacturing, robots are used for assembly lines, enhancing efficiency and precision. The healthcare sector has seen the introduction of robotic surgery, which allows for minimally invasive procedures with greater accuracy. Additionally, robots are employed in logistics and warehousing to streamline operations and reduce human error. In the service industry, robots are being used in hotels and restaurants to assist with customer service and food delivery. Personally, I find the rise of robotics fascinating and believe they have the potential to significantly improve productivity and quality of life. On the positive side, robots can handle repetitive and hazardous tasks, reducing the risk of injury and freeing up humans for more creative and complex work. However, there are concerns about job displacement and the potential loss of employment opportunities for low-skilled workers. It is crucial to find a balance where robots complement human labor rather than replace it, ensuring that the benefits of technological advancements are shared across society.

News websites, social media platforms, and streaming services have replaced traditional forms of media. Instead of waiting for a specific time to watch news or a favorite TV show, I now have the ability to access information and entertainment anytime, anywhere. This shift has impacted my reading habits too: I tend to read shorter articles or browse through social media posts instead of dedicating time to long-form reading like I used to. The convenience of instant access has changed the way I interact with media, often leading to a faster-paced, more fragmented consumption of content.", "task_id": "7e0827d0-955c-484a-8c4f-81fe6a574af8", "level_title": "11-Upper Intermediate", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Language learning is an exciting journey, but it comes with its fair share of challenges. One major hurdle is vocabulary retention students often struggle to remember and use new words effectively. Without consistent practice, new vocabulary can fade quickly.\nAnother issue is pronunciation and accent. Many students find it dificult  to mimic the sounds of a new language, especially if those sounds don't exist in their native tongue. This can lead to miscommunication and th questions help to clary the topic. \nAdditionally, language immersion can be challenging. While immersing oneself in a language is one of the best ways to learn, not everyone has access to native speakers or a community where they can practice.\nLastly, confidence and fear of making mistakes often hold learners back. Speaking a new language requires stepping out of one’s comfort zone, and fear of embarrassment can prevent students from practicing.\nTo overcome these challenges, students can engage in daily practice, seek out language exchange partners, and embrace making mistakes as part of the learning process. After all, persistence is key to success in language learning!", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 4}

The Grand Bazaar’s chaos contrasts sharply with Barcelona’s organized markets like La Boqueria.\n\nThough different in pace and personality, both cities capture the heart.

[SEP] Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.", "task_id": "4c7e3fcb-8c2b-46a7-b947-838fab5fb577", "level_title": "Military", "label": 0}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: TrainQuick offers a cheaper and more flexible solution. It allows employees to take courses remotely, which might seem appealing, especially given its lower cost. However, the feedback from other branches indicates that employees are not fully engaging with the training. One notable issue is that employees dislike being mixed with staff from other branches in the same classes. This lack of personalization and interaction with familiar colleagues has made it less effective in fostering team-building and engagement.\n\nOn the other hand, Skills Pro is more expensive, but the feedback suggests the quality of its courses is superior. While some employees find the content challenging, those who complete the course report successful outcomes and increased skill development. Additionally, Skills Pro has plans to expand its course offerings, which could provide more value in the long run.\n\nUltimately, although Skills Pro comes at a higher cost, its reputation for quality and the success of its program make it the better choice for us.

Eu não posso concordar, por minha militância na democratização da poesia. Democratização não é a facilitação. Não. É o convite através de uma linguagem mais simples, longe da simplória, àqueles que não têm o costume da leitura de poemas, ou usando um termo de um amigo meu: Pregar aos não convertidos. O meu sonho é que a poesia ganhe as ruas, de modo mais literal possível.\n\n        Não faço apologia à poema de má qualidade, descuidada, mas prego a diversidade de linguagem, já imaginaram as pessoas nos escritórios, nos salões de cabeleireiros, ou em qualquer outra parte conversando sobre poesia em vez de conversar sobre a novela das oito?

[SEP] Response: Learning a new language is both exciting and challenging. One of the most common issues language learners face is fear of making mistakes. Many students feel embarrassed when speaking, which can limit their progress and confidence. Pronunciation and grammar rules also present difficulties, especially when they differ significantly from the learner's native language.\n\nAnother major challenge is vocabulary retention. Even after learning new words, it’s easy to forget them without frequent practice. This is especially true when learners don’t have enough opportunities to use the language in real-life situations. Lack of immersion or exposure to native speakers can make it harder to improve listening and speaking skills.\n\nAdditionally, motivation plays a big role. Some students feel discouraged if they don’t see quick results, especially when progress seems slow. To overcome these obstacles, learners need consistent practice, supportive learning environments, and tools like language apps or conversation partners. Setting small, achievable goals can also help students stay motivated and track their progress.\n\nDespite these challenges, language learning is a rewarding experience that opens doors to new cultures and opportunities. With patience and the right strategies, learners can overcome their fears and become more confident speakers.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Aviation [SEP] Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Fuselage\nThe fuselage is the long, narrow tube that forms the main body of the aircraft. Inside, it houses the cabin for the crew and passengers. The bottom section contains the luggage compartment and the landing gear.\n\nWings\nThe wings provide lift and assist the aircraft in flight. They are equipped with flaps, which can be adjusted to control speed and stability. Lowering the flaps increases lift, aiding in takeoff and landing. Raising the flaps reduces drag, allowing for smoother flight. Flaps can also be used to slow the aircraft down when necessary.\n\nTail (Fin)\nThe tail section ensures stability and controls the direction of the aircraft. The vertical stabilizer (fin) helps maintain balance from side to side, while the horizontal stabilizer controls the up-and-down movement of the nose. Pilots adjust these surfaces to maneuver the aircraft in yaw (left and right) and pitch (up and down).\n\nEngines\nThe engines generate the high power needed for propulsion. During takeoff, they operate at approximately 65–75% of their full power to provide the necessary thrust for ascent.\n\n", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

If you want effectively motivate your employees you have to remember that the most important thing is treating them with respect and appreciating their hard work. Treat people the same way you would like to be treated - this is very simple. The employess who are praised, respected, understood and feel that the company and superiors take care of them are more motivated. In a result their work is much more effective and often achieve a success. \nRemember, a good chief doesn't have to show his or her superiority to gain the subordinates respect. Losing temper, as well as claiming responsibility for work done are always bad idea. Listen to people and don't judge them too hastily. Try to understand them and be empathetic, but at the same time make an impression you are the person who they can trust. Don't forget one thing - being human doesn't mean you can't be assertive, responsible, decisive.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in my country can be both exciting and overwhelming, with various steps to navigate. The process itself tends to be challenging, especially for first-time buyers. The first major hurdle is securing a home loan, which typically requires filling out several forms, providing proof of income, and undergoing a credit check. Lenders often require detailed financial documentation, including tax returns and employment verification, which can feel tedious. Additionally, depending on the lender, the process can take weeks to months to finalize.\n\nHousing prices in my country have risen significantly over the past few years, making it increasingly difficult to afford a home, particularly in urban areas. Many people are turning to loans to cover the high costs, but with house prices soaring, the loan amounts required are also substantial. This means monthly repayments can stretch budgets, and the overall cost of homeownership is steep.\n\nInterest rates on home loans fluctuate based on the economy and individual lenders, but they generally range between 3-6%. While this might seem reasonable, over time, interest can significantly increase the total cost of the loan.\n\nIt’s often advisable to use a real estate agent to help navigate the housing market and find suitable properties, though it’s not mandatory. A mortgage broker can also be beneficial, especially if you’re unsure which lender offers the best terms for your financial situation. Despite the challenges, owning a home remains a major goal for many people, though it requires careful planning and consideration.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

This trend is expected to continue, with public transport becoming a greener and more convenient option.\n2. Air Travel Evolution: The airline industry is undergoing significant changes, with cost-cutting measures and budget airlines offering cheaper flights. Despite this, people are still taking to the skies for mid- to long-distance travel.\n3. The Dawn of Space Tourism: Space travel is emerging as a new frontier, with agencies offering trips to space for those who can afford it. While currently targeted at the high-end market, it's possible that space tourism could become a mass market phenomenon in the future.\n\nThese trends highlight the changing way we travel and the exciting possibilities on the horizon.

Write back to them about the state of the industry in your country, or internationally, it's up to you. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: Positive thinking is more than just a mindset—it is a powerful tool that can transform your entire life. When you focus on the good, even in difficult situations, you train your mind to see opportunities instead of obstacles. This simple shift in perspective can improve your mood, relationships, health, and success.\n\nPeople who practice positive thinking are often more resilient. They bounce back from failure faster and learn from their mistakes. They approach challenges with confidence and believe in their ability to grow and improve. This optimism creates a sense of hope that helps them keep moving forward, even when times are tough.\n\nPositive thinking also affects physical health. Studies show that people with a positive outlook are less likely to suffer from stress-related illnesses. They often sleep better, have lower blood pressure, and enjoy better overall well-being.\n\nOf course, staying positive doesn’t mean ignoring reality or pretending that everything is perfect. It means choosing to face life with courage and faith, trusting that things can get better. It involves gratitude, self-compassion, and surrounding yourself with supportive people.\n\nYou can develop positive thinking by practicing daily affirmations, setting realistic goals, and focusing on what you can control. Even small habits like smiling more or writing down things you're thankful for can make a big difference.\n\nIn a world full of negativity and pressure, choosing positivity is a powerful act. It can change your life and inspire those around you. So, no matter where you are in your journey, remember: your thoughts have power.

I’m writing to address some concerns that have been raised regarding the stability of the construction business and rumors surrounding our share prices.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to stress that Future Foundations is in a solid position to maintain stability in an otherwise unpredictable market. The rumors you may have heard about a significant drop in share prices are unfounded. While it's true that two months ago our share value dipped, this was a direct consequence of the former CEO, Greg Johnson, stepping down. However, with Harry Levi—an industry leader with an excellent reputation—now at the helm, we have seen our share value not only recover but increase to an all-time high.\n\nWe understand how important stability is to you as shareholders, and I’m pleased to inform you that we have recently secured three major contracts, ensuring profitability over the next three years. These contracts are a testament to the strength of our leadership and the quality of our operations. We are confident that they will drive continued growth and further solidify our market position.\n\nYour loyalty has been crucial to our success, and we greatly appreciate your continued trust in Future Foundations. We believe the future is bright, and we are committed to keeping you informed every step of the way. To further reassure you of our long-term strategy, we will soon be sharing our five-year road map, which outlines our goals and vision for continued growth and stability.\n\nThank you for your support, and please don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions.\n\nWarm regards,  \nAnderson Oliveira\nCEO, Future Foundations Construction Company  ", "task_id": "c2ac7c1e-b808-4c21-8ee1-c1abac0c2a49", "level_title": "Correspondence", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find metaphor, focused free writing, and listing the most useful. Metaphor stands out because it allows me to convey complex ideas through vivid comparisons, making my writing more engaging and helping readers relate abstract concepts to familiar images. For instance, describing a challenge as a \"mountain to climb\" immediately evokes a sense of struggle and effort, enhancing the emotional impact of the writing.\n\nFocused free writing is valuable because it helps me explore a specific idea or topic in a spontaneous, unrestricted way while still keeping me on track. This technique is especially helpful when I'm stuck, as it allows my thoughts to flow naturally, often leading to unexpected insights.\n\nListing, on the other hand, is a highly practical tool that helps me organize my thoughts and ideas quickly. When I need to brainstorm or outline my work, listing provides a clear structure and ensures I don't forget important points.

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In my country, robots are increasingly being used in various industries, such as manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, and even customer service. In factories, robots perform repetitive tasks with precision and speed, which increases productivity and reduces human error. In hospitals, robotic systems assist in surgeries and patient care, improving outcomes and making complex procedures safer. In agriculture, robots help with planting, harvesting, and monitoring crops. I feel optimistic about these advancements because they can greatly improve efficiency and quality of life. However, I also recognize the potential downsides. The widespread use of robots might lead to job displacement, especially in sectors that rely on manual labor. This could increase unemployment and widen economic inequality if not managed properly. On the positive side, robots can take over dangerous or tedious tasks, reducing risks to human workers and allowing people to focus on more creative and meaningful work. Overall, I believe robots will benefit society if their integration is handled thoughtfully and ethically.\n", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Whether it's starting a new job, moving to a different city, or adjusting to unexpected circumstances, change challenges us to grow and adapt. Although it can be uncomfortable at first, change often brings new opportunities and fresh perspectives.\n\nMany people resist change because it brings uncertainty. It takes us out of our comfort zones and forces us to confront the unknown. However, resisting change can old us back from reaching our full potential. By embracing it, we open the door to personal development and transformation.\n\nTo make the most of change, it’s important to stay positive, set clear goals, and remain flexible. Accepting that not everything is within our control allows us to focus on what we can influence. Even setbacks can become stepping stones toward success when we adopt a mindset of growth.\n\nSurrounding ourselves with supportive people and taking time to reflect can also help during transitions. In the end, change isn’t something to fear—it’s something to welcome. It reminds us that we’re alive, evolving, and capable of creating better versions of ourselves with every step forward.\n", "task_id": "5c876868-2e44-427a-b9cf-6d6ad90d0e50", "level_title": "Hospitality Industry", "label": 0}

But what might surprise you is that our roots actually lie in the travel industry. Yes, we started out as a travel agency back in 2000, helping people plan their dream vacations and business trips. Our original focus was on creating seamless travel experiences, and that emphasis on service and attention to detail is something we’ve carried through as we evolved.\n\nSlide 3: The Shift to Finance \n\nSo, how did we go from planning vacations to managing portfolios? Well, like any growing company, we recognized new opportunities and made some big changes. In the early 2005, we made a strategic shift into the finance sector. It was a bold move, but we saw a gap in the market for a financial services company that brought the same level of personalization and care that we had in travel. And it worked. Over the past few years, we’ve grown exponentially, expanding our services to include everything from wealth management to corporate financial solutions.”", "task_id": "78f976f6-a505-4597-877b-94d9bca3b217", "level_title": "Presentations", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Buying a home in my country is both exciting and challenging. The process involves several steps, from finding the right property to securing a home loan.

In smaller cities, homes are more affordable but prices are rising everywhere.\nApplying for a home loan requires careful planning. anks and housing finance companies offer loans, but the paperwork can be overwhelming.

Fixed and floating rate options are available, and I had to decide which worked best for me.\nI didn't use a mortgage broker, as banks provide direct assistance, but a real estate agent helped me find a suitable property and navigate legal formalities.

The sample included a wide demographic range, and participants were asked for their opinions on the collarless dress shirt.\n\nFindings:\nIn Rio, only 35% approved of the shirt, and just 20% would buy it. In contrast, Shanghai showed stronger interest, with 80% approval and 40% likely to purchase. Key issues for those who disapproved included the design, size, color, and material.\n\nConclusions:\nOverall interest was higher in Shanghai, suggesting regional acceptance varies significantly. Respondents felt the product lacked diversity in design and was poorly executed despite a good concept.\n\nRecommendations:\nFurther market research is needed, especially in Rio. Product improvements should include slim-fit sizing, better material (e.g., wrinkle-free, sweat-absorbent), strong color options, and detailed design elements like stitching. Prioritizing changes for the Rio market is advised, as the response in Asia was more positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "c4a6991e-c330-41bd-88de-31bb25ee4bf1", "level_title": "Correspondence", "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: \nIn Indian mythology, there are numerous mythical creatures and monsters that populate the vast array of stories and folklore. One such fictitious monster is the \"Rakshasa.\" Rakshasas are often depicted as powerful, malevolent beings with the ability to change their shape at will. They are known for their cunning and deceit and frequently appear as antagonists in various myths and legends.\n\nRakshasas are said to possess magical powers and can be incredibly strong and fierce. They typically have grotesque appearances, with sharp claws, fangs, and a fearsome demeanor. Despite their evil nature, Rakshasas are complex beings, sometimes showing qualities of bravery and intelligence. They are known to disrupt religious rituals, harass sages, and generally cause chaos.\n\nOne of the most famous Rakshasas in Indian mythology is Ravana, the ten-headed demon king who abducts Sita in the epic Ramayana. Despite being portrayed as a villain, Ravana is also depicted as a learned scholar and a devotee of Lord Shiva, illustrating the nuanced portrayal of Rakshasas in these stories.\n\nRakshasas symbolize the darker aspects of human nature and the eternal struggle between good and evil, often serving as catalysts for the heroes' journeys and moral lessons in Indian mythology.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is made up of different parts, such as the fuselage, wings, tail, and engines.\nThe fuselage is a critical component of an airplane that plays a role in the airplane's performance, safety, and passenger comfort. The size, shape, and materials of the fuselage affect the airplane's speed, maneuverability, and fuel economy. The fuselage includes the cockpit, passenger cabin, and cargo hold.\nThe wings play a critical role in generating lift, which allows the airplane to fly. Wings come in different shapes and sizes, and their design, shape, size, and location determine their use. The wings carry fuel tanks.\nThe tail is the rear part of the airplane, which provides stability and control to the airplane. The tail keeps the airplane balanced and allows the pilot to control the tilt of the airplane during maneuvers. Without the tail, the airplane would have difficulty doing all of this.\nThe engines provide the necessary thrust for the airplane to move forward. Without the engines, the airplane would not be able to move and fly.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 4}

She came home after a long day to find her bookshelf... empty. Every single book, gone. At first, she thought maybe she'd left them at her friend’s place, but upon checking, they weren’t there either.\n\nShe double-checked the apartment, but there was no sign of forced entry or anything suspicious. Then, she noticed something odd: the air felt cooler, almost as if the books had absorbed all the warmth and suddenly evaporated into thin air. Feeling a bit unnerved, she went to the kitchen to make a cup of tea, hoping to shake off the feeling of dread. But when she returned, the books were back—stacked neatly, exactly where they had been before.\n\nThe strangest part? Lily swears she heard faint whispers coming from the shelves while the books were missing. Could it have been a prank? Or was something supernatural at play? Either way, we’re both left with a lingering curiosity and more than a little apprehension whenever we see a bookshelf now.", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: One of my favorite cities is Barcelona, Spain, a vibrant coastal city known for its unique architecture and lively atmosphere. In contrast, Paris, France, offers a more classical, refined charm. Barcelona’s streets are alive with the sounds of street performers and the hustle of tourists, particularly around iconic landmarks like La Sagrada Familia and Park Güell. Its Mediterranean climate makes it a popular summer destination, with people flocking to the beaches and enjoying the outdoor cafes. The city’s architecture, largely designed by Antoni Gaudí, adds a whimsical, almost dreamlike quality to the urban landscape.\n\nOn the other hand, Paris has an elegance rooted in its rich history and art. The grandeur of the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum speaks to the city’s historical significance, while its stylish boutiques and cafes give off a sophisticated vibe. Paris is a city for those who appreciate art, culture, and fine dining, with an atmosphere that feels both timeless and luxurious. While Barcelona offers a more laid-back, energetic environment, Paris stands as a symbol of elegance and history, appealing to a different set of preferences.\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which came into effect on January 1, 1994, was a landmark trade deal between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Its primary goal was to eliminate or reduce barriers to trade, such as tariffs, and to create a more integrated North American economy. Over time, NAFTA significantly boosted trade in goods like agricultural products, with Mexican fruits and vegetables, for example, flowing more freely into the U.S. economy. While the agreement brought many benefits, including increased exports and job creation in some sectors, it also had its downsides. Critics argued that NAFTA led to job losses in certain U.S. industries, such as manufacturing, as companies moved operations to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs. Despite these challenges, overall, NAFTA was seen as beneficial to all three countries by increasing trade, fostering economic growth, and encouraging investment across the region.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find metaphor, focused free writing, and questioning to be particularly useful. Metaphors are powerful tools that can convey complex ideas and emotions through vivid imagery, making abstract concepts more relatable and understandable. They enrich the text and engage readers by drawing parallels between seemingly unrelated things.\n\nFocused free writing is another valuable technique. It allows for the free flow of ideas within a specific topic, helping to overcome writer's block and generate raw material that can be refined later. This method encourages creativity and can lead to unexpected insights and connections that might not emerge through more structured writing approaches.\n\nQuestioning is also essential, as it drives the exploration of a topic. By asking probing questions, writers can delve deeper into their subject matter, uncovering new angles and perspectives. This technique not only aids in developing a thorough understanding of the topic but also helps in structuring the writing logically and coherently.\n\nTogether, these techniques enhance the writing process by fostering creativity, clarity, and depth, making them indispensable tools for any writer.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Suddenly, there was a bang in the oven and I noticed that I accidentally kept the spatula inside the oven with the cake. The oven stopped and there was so much smoke that the fire alarm went off and I was scared. As I started running, I bump my head in the glass door and ended up having a bump on my forehead.\n\nHearing the noise and my scream (for the bump in my forehead), my mother ran out of the room and as I recited the story to her, she was laughing uncontrollably on how bad of a baker I am.\n\nI hope this incident brought a smile on your face and you miss me that you come to visit me soon!\n\nTake care!\nWarm Regards", "task_id": "52a760cd-9898-4cce-bb43-c490923b2b45", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 3}

Usually, a lender will require it as protection against your mortgage, but if you pay for your property in cash, it is up to you to decide what risks you want to face, or in other words, how peacefully you can sleep at night. Insurance is a business, and like every business, insurance companies assess their own risk management, which includes identification, evaluation, control, and review. It is mainly for this reason (economic sustainability) that they do not offer insurance for natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, or nuclear accidents. The balance of income and costs would be absolutely out of their scope. So, cross your fingers and pay for relative peace.

[SEP] Response: Dear Harry, first of all: \"A warm welcome\" to our Company!\" and thank you for asking me suggestions about how to better deal with your subordinates. In my opinion the main thing is to treat everyone with respect, regardless the hierarchy, and to listen to them even when they are complaining. Another advice is to make them feel part of the Company and that the Company really cares of them and their wellbeing, since Company's success depends on their individual contribution. This is because it is important that they are rewarded for their job when they achieve results, and that they have a good work-life balance too. Do not be afraid of offering training to them when needed to improve their performances, act as their mentor. I am sure they will be grateful to you in the future and this can help build up a stronger professional relationship and willingness to cooperate with you. Should you instead take credit for work done by them, or blame them for mistakes that are your responsibility, then I am afraid you would lose their trust and exsteem and working together everyday could become a real struggle. So, to sum up, the main \"rule\" to follow is to treat your co-workers as you would like to be treated by your supervisors.

Choose from one or two of the options provided and write 80-100 words. Options: general cargo safety and stowage; staffing levels and working conditions; general condition and maintenance of the vessel; safety standards; pollution [SEP] Response: One common problem on board a ship is poor cargo safety and stowage. If cargo is not properly secured, it can shift during rough seas, causing damage to the ship or injury to the crew. To solve this, the crew should carefully follow stowage plans, use strong securing materials, and check the cargo regularly during the voyage.\n\nAnother problem is pollution. Oil or waste can accidentally enter the sea, harming marine life. To prevent this, ships must use proper waste management systems, follow MARPOL regulations, and train the crew in environmental protection procedures.\n\n", "task_id": "3e9aee0e-9908-4ad0-aa60-a2f09ad38119", "level_title": "Maritime", "label": 4}

DNA testing confirmed that several northern flocks previously believed to be robins represent a genetically distinct species. The newly identified bird is slightly smaller, with a larger bill and rustier plumage in males. Unlike the American robin, it does not migrate south of Canada during winter. The bird occupies similar habitats, favoring temperate forests and open woodlands. Based on its behavior, appearance, and geographic distribution, the proposed scientific name is Turdus canadensis. This discovery contributes valuable information to the understanding of avian biodiversity in North America and highlights the importance of molecular testing in modern taxonomy.\n\n", "task_id": "76bba4e9-a91a-49e2-89a6-129b5a013873", "level_title": "Sciences", "label": 5}

After a thorough analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each location, it is clear that Office One offers significant benefits that make it the most suitable choice. The lower rent, proximity to restaurants, and accessibility to public transportation are key factors that contribute to its appeal. Conversely, Office Bravo's distance from the city poses a major drawback. Therefore, we recommend selecting Office One as our new office location to ensure convenience and employee satisfaction.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nAn obvious advantage of Office One is that the rent is cheaper. Another big advantage is that there are a lot of restaurants nearby, as well as a bus and train station. A big con of Office Bravo is that it's too far from the city.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Office One is the best choice for a new office location for the company.

A luz mortiça dos candeeiros deixava antever traços finos e oblíquos de água fria. Alcina refugiou-se debaixo do toldo de uma velha loja de ferragens, fechada havia muitos anos. A noite não estava convidativa mas havia sempre quem estivesse disposto a comprar felicidade falsa e prazer duvidoso.\n\nTal como o antigo patrão que a iniciara naquela vida… Uma vida perdida ou talvez não. Doutra forma estaria, aos 36 anos, rodeada de um rancho de filhos que tinha de sustentar, um marido bêbado para aturar, o gado para tratar e as terras para amanhar.\n\nParou um carro. Saiu da cobertura, aproximou-se da janela que desceu lentamente. Entre sorrisos, disparou um costumado cumprimento:\n\n- Boa noite, sortudo…\n\n- Sortudo?\n\n- Sim! Vejo que queres companhia. E estou aqui para te ajudar…\n\nAs frases eram invariavelmente as mesmas, proferidas naquele tom meloso de provocação libidinosa. Afastou-se do carro um pouco para que a apreciasse. O condutor não gostou do que viu e sem nada dizer, arrancou.\n\nMais à frente duas jovens tiveram mais sorte e entraram na viatura.\n\nAlcina nem pestanejou. Já sabia que era assim. A sua idade trazia-lhe profundos sulcos na face, que nem as camadas de base conseguiam disfarçar.\n\nTodavia o corpo parecia menos mau, assim julgava. Vestia nessa noite uma minisaia curta que mais parecia um cinto. Um top cotado e meias de renda. Por cima, um casaco comprido de um vermelho berrante mas atractivo.\n\nRegressou ao toldo e sentou-se no degrau frio e molhado. Encostou a cabeça à parede e adormeceu. Nesse sono acabou por viajar ao seu passado, umas vezes fantástico, outras nem tanto. Parecia sentir ainda o cheiro do pão acabado de cozer e outrossim do corpo gordo e mal-cheiroso do velho que a possuíra pela primeira vez. Aquele sono levou-a de regresso à sua antiga escola, onde as letras e os números a animavam. E à mãe que desejava colocar a filha a estudar mas o pai, austero e avaro, só pretendia dinheiro.\n\nSentiu um toque muito ao de leve no ombro. Acordou sobressaltada e deu de caras com um jovem rapaz que a mirava. Perguntou:\n\n- Não achas que és muito novo para andares às meninas?\n\nO jovem voluntário olhou para os colegas ao lado e sorriu. Insistiu:\n\n- Posso ajudá-la nalguma coisa?\n\nAlcina percebendo finalmente o equívoco, respondeu:\n\n- Hum, só gostava de voltar a ser feliz!\n\nTags:400 palavrasescrita\n link do post comentar favorito\ninícioseguinte »\n5 comentários\n Anónimo  08.12.2014\nlink do comentário\nresponder\ndiscussão\nImagem de perfil\n José da Xã  08.12.2014\nObrigado Paulo.

Be sure to polish your work before you submit it. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: When considering iconic American cities, New York City and Los Angeles often come to mind. Both cities are renowned for their cultural influence, economic power, and diverse populations. However, beneath these similarities lie distinct differences that define their unique characters.\nOne of the most apparent differences between New York City and Los Angeles lies in their geographical settings and climates. New York City, located in the northeastern United States, experiences a full range of seasons, including cold, snowy winters and hot, humid summers. The city's dense urban landscape is a mix of towering skyscrapers and historic buildings, all within proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. In contrast, Los Angeles is situated in Southern California and boasts a Mediterranean climate characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The sprawling city, surrounded by mountains and the Pacific Ocean, is known for its extensive freeway system and expansive suburban areas. These geographical and climatic differences influence everything from architecture to lifestyle.\nBoth cities are cultural and economic powerhouses, but they exert their influence in different ways. New York City's culture is a melting pot of global influences, evident in its diverse neighborhoods, world-class museums, and thriving arts scene. It is a hub for finance, media, and fashion, with Wall Street symbolizing its economic might. Los Angeles, on the other hand, is synonymous with the entertainment industry. Hollywood, the heart of the global film and television industry, defines much of the city's identity. While New York is fast-paced and competitive, known for its high-pressure business environment, Los Angeles is often perceived as more laid-back, with a focus on creativity and innovation.\nIn conclusion, while New York City and Los Angeles share significant similarities as influential American metropolises, their differences are pronounced. From climate and geographical setting to cultural focus and lifestyle, each city offers a distinct experience to its residents and visitors. New York City embodies a fast-paced, cosmopolitan ethos, while Los Angeles exudes a relaxed, sun-soaked vibe with a creative edge. Understanding these differences enriches the appreciation of what each city has to offer, highlighting the diverse tapestry that makes up the United States.", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

It holds the passengers cargo and cockpit where the pilots sit and control the plane. It connects all the other parts together. The wings are large flat surfaces that extend from both sides of the fuselage. They create lift which allows the airplane to rise into the air. Air flows over and under the wings, helping the plane stay up while flying. The tail of the airplane, also called the empennage helps keep the plane stable in the air. It usually includes a vertical fin and horizontal stabilizers. These parts help the pilot control the direction and balance of the airplane. The engines provide the power needed for flight. Most airplanes have jet engines or propellers that push the plane forward. As the plane moves forward quickly the wings produce enough lift to take off. All of these parts work together to help the airplane fly smoothly stay balanced and get to its destination safely.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

After starting the year with sharp declines due to lingering concerns over China’s economic slowdown and global inflationary pressures, the index began to rebound in late May.\n\nDriven by renewed investor confidence, tech sector gains, and government stimulus efforts, the HSI climbed nearly 8% in June, marking its strongest monthly performance in over a year. Notably, major players such as Tencent and Alibaba saw significant upticks, helping to lift overall market sentiment.\n\nDespite this recovery, analysts urge caution. Ongoing geopolitical tensions, sluggish property sector growth, and cautious consumer spending continue to weigh on investor outlook. However, the HSI’s recent upward trend suggests a potential turning point for Hong Kong’s financial markets.\n\nLooking ahead, sustained policy support from Beijing and improvements in global trade could further stabilize the index. For now, the Hang Seng is cautiously regaining ground, offering investors a glimpse of optimism amid ongoing global economic challenges.\n\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like this adjusted based on specific data points or a graph you have!\n\n", "task_id": "cdae6efc-7781-456b-92eb-2d7a6d0103b2", "level_title": "Hospitality Industry", "label": 0}

Read the question, then write a suitable answer. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: \n\nThe medical industry is the biggest industry in the U.S., and is also one of the fastest growing industries. It combines medical technology with the human touch, and provides jobs for about 13 million Americans. The demand for healthcare is growing in many areas, such as emergency treatment, therapy or long-term care.\n\nThe health services industry is always changing, and technological advances have made many new procedures and methods of diagnosis and treatment possible. Clinical developments like organ transplants, less invasive surgical techniques, skin grafts, and gene therapy for cancer treatment continue to increase the longevity and improve the quality of life for many people. Medical advances have also improved the survival rates of trauma victims and the severely ill, increasing the need for therapists and support personnel. Our expanding medical knowledge has also created an enormous number of medical specialties to choose from, such as cardiology, ophthalmology, or oncology.\n\nA career in medicine has benefits as well as shortcomings. On the one hand, jobs are generally well-paid and demand is high for skilled, qualified people. However, it can take many years of study to specialize in medicine, and the profession requires continuing education to keep up with new equipment and procedures.\n\nHours are usually long and irregular. Most physicians, for example, work more than 60 hours a week and can be on-call at any time, day or night. Shift work is common in some occupations, such as for registered nurses. However, if you can deal with these tough working conditions, you will probably find the job extremely rewarding, and you may even be able to save lives.\n", "task_id": "ae90d852-9ab7-47ca-a8f8-4a90eaec83f4", "level_title": "Medical industry", "label": 5}

Their operation hinges on the principles of aerodynamics, utilizing carefully designed airfoils to generate lift, counteracting gravity and enabling flight.  Powerful engines, ranging from propeller-driven systems to advanced turbofan engines, provide the necessary thrust to propel these aircraft through the air at remarkable speeds.

[SEP] Response: Robots are increasingly being used in India across industries like manufacturing, automotive, logistics, healthcare, and education. The adoption of industrial robots has surged, with India ranking among the top countries for new installations, driven by the need for automation in sectors such as automotive, electronics, and e-commerce. Robots help boost productivity, improve workplace safety, and ensure consistent product quality, while also reducing labor costs and material waste. In education, robotics fosters creativity and prepares students for future careers. Personally, I feel optimistic about the potential of robots to transform Indian society, making work safer and more efficient, and opening new opportunities in tech-driven fields.\n\nHowever, there are concerns. The rapid spread of robots could lead to job displacement, especially for low-skilled workers, increasing unemployment and income inequality.

Read the question, then write a suitable answer. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The journey of a doctor usually begins with studying in medical school, which lasts from 5 to 7 years, where basic sciences are learned and diseases are identified and how to diagnose and treat them. This stage requires a lot of study and commitment, and is often intense.\n\nAfter the first years of theoretical study, the student moves to practical training in hospitals, where he learns how to deal with patients and follow up on medical cases practically. This stage is a major turning point because it requires new skills such as communicating with patients,\n\nAfter graduating from medical school, the doctor begins the residency program, which is a specialized training that may last from 3 to 7 years depending on the specialty. During this period, resident doctors work long hours and may be exposed to great psychological and physical pressure. Here they learn how to treat complex cases and rely on themselves in making medical decisions.\n\nAfter residency, the doctor can choose a specific specialty, and this requires an additional stage known as a fellowship, where he trains in advanced skills in his field of specialization. This stage gives him deep experience and may last for several years.\n\nDuring the years of training, the doctor receives a salary, but it may not be enough compared to the long hours and pressures he is exposed to. However, after completing training, doctors enjoy a distinguished professional status and a stable income, but it varies according to the specialty and the place where they work.\n\n6. Working in a hospital or clinic:\nWorking in hospitals or clinics depends on the specialty, as doctors deal with different cases on a daily basis and treat patients. Each work environment has its challenges, as working in a hospital may be more crowded and require long working hours, while clinics may have more regular working hours.\n\nIn short, the medical profession is a noble profession, but it requires a lot of commitment and dedication to serving others. During their professional journey, the doctor learns to be humble and patient, and is highly appreciated by society, but they must also be prepared to bear the constant pressures of work.

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane has several important parts that work together to help it fly. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane. It holds the passengers, cargo, and cockpit where the pilots sit. The wings are attached to the sides of the fuselage. They provide lift, which allows the airplane to rise into the air when it moves forward.\n\nAt the back of the airplane is the tail, also called the empennage. The tail helps keep the airplane stable during flight. It usually includes a vertical part (the rudder) that helps the plane turn left or right, and a horizontal part (the elevator) that helps it go up or down.\n\nThe engines are usually located under the wings or on the fuselage. They provide the thrust needed to push the airplane forward at high speed. This forward motion, combined with the lift from the wings, allows the airplane to take off, fly, and land safely.\n\nEach of these parts plays a vital role in making sure an airplane can fly smoothly and safely through the sky.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

Zones help enforce the protection of the marine environment, fishing law, control of environmental pollution, and also regulate scientific research projects. This is very important in sensitive areas of the world. The naval forces of many countries, as well as merchant shipping, often convey information that helps support the work of UNCLOS.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Companies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover. Each and every company should form a CSR team and monitor and volunteer in promoting the nearby communities.\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n\nAgainst CSR\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings.

[SEP] Response: Out of the nine writing techniques that were introduced in this curriculum, questioning, loop writing, and focused free writing sounds most effective to me. As a left-brained person, logical and analytical flow of thoughts give me the best outcome. Also, free writing is inarguably the best practice for anyone who is pursuing writing as a hobby- it takes the pain out of the total creative process. For someone who just wants to get started, free writing and thereafter focused free writing would yield the best outcomes- this technique combines the freedom of free writing with the focus of structured writing, making it an excellent tool for developing both fiction and non-fiction in a more targeted manner. Cubing was an entirely new concept that I learned in this curriculum, which sounds promising.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a trade deal between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It came into effect in January 1994 after years of negotiations. The main goal of NAFTA was to reduce or eliminate customs duties on goods traded between these three countries.\n\nNAFTA has significantly impacted trade relations, particularly in agriculture. For example, it allowed Mexican fruits and vegetables to be sold more easily in the US. This has benefited farmers and consumers by providing a wider variety of products at lower prices.\n\nHowever, NAFTA has had both positive and negative effects on its member countries. On the positive side, it has increased trade and economic cooperation, leading to job creation and economic growth. On the negative side, some industries have faced challenges due to increased competition, and there have been concerns about labor and environmental standards.\n\nOverall, NAFTA has played a crucial role in shaping the economic landscape of North America, influencing trade policies and economic relationships among the US, Canada, and Mexico.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

When they opened the box, it had letters, some old photos, and a diary from a boy who lived there back in 1925!\n\nIn the end, they took everything to the city museum, and the story even ended up in the local newspaper.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: \nFor Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is vital for modern businesses as it aligns with ethical practices and sustainable growth. Proponents argue that CSR enhances a company's reputation, builds consumer trust, and fosters customer loyalty. By addressing social and environmental issues, companies can differentiate themselves from competitors and create a positive brand image. CSR initiatives can lead to operational efficiencies and cost savings, such as reducing waste or conserving energy. Furthermore, engaging in CSR attracts and retains employees who value social consciousness in their workplace. It also opens up new market opportunities by appealing to socially responsible investors and consumers. Ultimately, CSR contributes to long-term business success and societal well-being.\n\nAgainst Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):\n\nCritics of CSR argue that it diverts focus from a company's primary economic role—maximizing shareholder value. CSR can be seen as a distraction, imposing additional costs and operational complexities that do not directly contribute to profit. Some believe that CSR initiatives are often superficial, serving as public relations tools rather than genuine commitments to social change. This \"greenwashing\" can mislead consumers and stakeholders. Additionally, detractors claim that CSR efforts can lead to conflicts of interest, with businesses potentially prioritizing social goals over economic performance. Critics assert that the responsibility for societal and environmental challenges should lie with governments and NGOs, not profit-driven corporations.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in my country can be both exciting and challenging. The process generally involves several steps and requires careful planning. One of the first things you need to do is find a suitable property, which often means working with a real estate agent. Although it’s not mandatory, most buyers prefer to use an agent because they help navigate the market, arrange property viewings, and handle negotiations.\n\nWhen it comes to applying for a home loan, there are quite a few forms to fill out. Lenders require detailed information about your identity, income, employment, savings, and credit history. You need to provide documents such as pay slips, tax returns, bank statements, and proof of residency. The paperwork can be time-consuming, but it’s necessary to prove your ability to repay the loan.\n\nHousing prices vary widely depending on the location. In big cities and popular areas, homes tend to be very expensive, which makes it difficult for first-time buyers to enter the market. Interest rates for home loans fluctuate with the economy but generally range from 6% to 10% per year.

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is made up of several key parts, each serving a specific function to help it fly safely and efficiently.\n\nFuselage: This is the main body of the airplane, where passengers and cargo are stored. It houses the cockpit, where the pilots control the aircraft, and the cabin, where people sit during the flight. The fuselage also supports other components like the wings and engines.\n\nWings: The wings provide lift, which is necessary for the airplane to stay in the air. They are designed to create a difference in air pressure above and below the wing, allowing the plane to rise. The wings also often have flaps and ailerons to control the plane’s speed, altitude, and direction.\n\nTail: The tail includes the horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer (rudder). The horizontal stabilizer helps keep the airplane stable in the air and prevents unwanted pitching movements, while the rudder helps control the plane’s yaw, or left-to-right movement.\n\nEngines: Engines are responsible for generating the thrust needed to propel the airplane forward. Most airplanes have either jet engines or propellers that push or pull the aircraft through the air, allowing it to reach cruising speeds and altitudes.\n\nTogether, these parts make an airplane capable of flight, ensuring stability, control, and propulsion.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

The intelligence indicated the arrival of a large illegal shipment.\n\nThe contraband—an estimated $5 million worth of black-market cigarettes and cigars—was transported by yacht, identified as the Empress of the Seas. The operation led to the apprehension of several suspects attempting to flee the scene. Among those detained were three individuals suspected of acting as human mules, including Barry Black, a primary subject of a year-long investigation. Wayne White was also identified at the scene.\n\nWhile no narcotics were discovered, the size of the shipment and prior intelligence suggest a potential link to broader smuggling operations, including drug trafficking. This marks the largest seizure of illegal tobacco products to date.\n\nAll seized items were logged upon return to the station at 4:54 a.m. on Friday the 13th—an unfortunate day for Mr. Black.

It officially came into effect in January 1994, after several years of complex negotiations. The main goal of NAFTA was to reduce or completely eliminate customs duties and other trade barriers among the three member countries, in order to encourage economic cooperation and integration.\nThe agreement has had a profound impact on trade relations within North America, particularly in the agricultural sector. For instance, it facilitated a large increase in the export of Mexican fruits and vegetables to the United States. Over the years, NAFTA has produced both positive and negative effects for the countries involved. While some industries and workers have faced challenges, many others have benefited from increased market access and economic growth.\nOverall, NAFTA has helped strengthen economic ties and has proven to be beneficial for all three member nations.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a landmark trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which came into effect in January 1994 after years of negotiation. The primary objective of NAFTA was to reduce or eliminate customs duties among the member countries, thereby fostering a more integrated and efficient North American market. This agreement has had a profound impact on trade relations, particularly in the agricultural sector. For example, it facilitated the seamless flow of Mexican fruits and vegetables into the U.S. market, benefiting both producers and consumers.\n\nNAFTA has been credited with boosting economic growth, creating jobs, and lowering prices for consumers across the member states. However, it has also faced criticism for contributing to job losses in certain industries, particularly manufacturing, and for its environmental impact. Despite these challenges, NAFTA has generally been seen as beneficial for all three member nations, enhancing economic integration and cooperation. Overall, NAFTA has played a crucial role in strengthening trade and economic ties among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, making it a significant milestone in the history of international trade agreements.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Sure! Here's a brief explanation of which writing techniques seem most useful to me:\n\nAmong the nine writing techniques introduced, metaphor and symbolism stand out as particularly useful. Metaphors allow writers to draw comparisons between seemingly unrelated concepts, enriching the text with deeper meaning and making abstract ideas more tangible. For instance, describing life as a \"journey\" can evoke a sense of adventure and growth. Symbolism, on the other hand, imbues objects, characters, or events with additional layers of significance, enhancing the reader's engagement and interpretation. A simple object like a \"rose\" can symbolize love, beauty, or even transience, depending on the context.\n\nFree writing and focused free writing are also invaluable techniques. Free writing encourages uninhibited expression, helping writers overcome blocks and discover new ideas. Focused free writing narrows this approach, allowing for exploration within specific themes or topics, which can be particularly useful for academic or professional writing.\n\nQuestioning and listing are practical tools for brainstorming and organizing thoughts. Questioning prompts deeper inquiry and critical thinking, while listing helps in structuring ideas logically and efficiently.\n\nOverall, these techniques collectively enhance creativity, clarity, and depth in writing, making them indispensable for any writer.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Title: The Power of Mindfulness\n\nIn today’s fast-paced, always-connected world, it can often feel like there’s no time to slow down. With constant notifications, tight deadlines, and endless to-do lists, we find ourselves caught up in a whirlwind of activity. But what if there was a simple practice that could help you regain focus, reduce stress, and unlock your true potential\n\nEnter mindfulness — the practice of being fully present and aware in the moment. While it may sound like a modern-day trend, mindfulness has deep roots in ancient spiritual traditions, particularly Buddhism. However, in recent years, mindfulness has gone mainstream, and for good reason: it has the power to transform not only your mental health but also your overall quality of life.\n\nWhat is Mindfulness?\nAt its core, mindfulness is about paying attention to the present moment without judgment. It’s about tuning into your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings, rather than rushing through life or dwelling on the past or future. By bringing awareness to each experience, you allow yourself to experience life more fully.\n\nMindfulness can take many forms: from practicing meditation to simply being more present during everyday tasks like eating, walking, or talking with others. The beauty of mindfulness is that it doesn’t require fancy equipment or a lot of time; it’s something you can integrate into your life, wherever you are.\n\nWhy Mindfulness Matters\nIn a world filled with distractions, mindfulness offers a chance to break free from the noise and truly connect with what’s important. Here are just a few reasons why mindfulness is worth making a part of your daily routine:\n\nStress Reduction: Mindfulness has been shown to significantly reduce stress and anxiety. By focusing on the present, you can break free from the cycle of worrying about what’s next or ruminating on past mistakes. This allows your body and mind to relax and recharge.\n\nImproved Focus: With so many distractions, it’s easy to lose focus on what’s important. Mindfulness trains your brain to stay in the moment, which helps improve concentration, whether you’re at work, studying, or enjoying a hobby.\n\nBetter Relationships: When you practice mindfulness, you become more aware of your emotions and reactions. This heightened self-awareness can improve communication and empathy in your relationships, allowing you to listen more attentively and respond more thoughtfully.\n\nIncreased Emotional Intelligence: Mindfulness helps you become more in tune with your emotions, which can lead to better decision-making, greater resilience, and improved emotional regulation. By understanding your feelings, you can respond to challenges with a clearer mind and more balanced perspective.\n\nPhysical Health Benefits: Research has shown that mindfulness practices can lower blood pressure, reduce inflammation, and boost overall immune function. In addition to improving mental health, mindfulness has a direct impact on physical well-being.\n\nHow to Practice Mindfulness\nThe best part about mindfulness is that it’s simple to practice and doesn’t require any special training or tools. Here are some simple ways you can incorporate mindfulness into your daily life:\n\nMindful Breathing: One of the simplest mindfulness exercises is to focus on your breath. Find a quiet space, close your eyes, and take deep, slow breaths. Pay attention to the sensation of the air entering and leaving your body. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your focus back to your breath.\n\nBody Scan: Lie down or sit comfortably, and focus on each part of your body, from your toes to your head. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort without judgment. This practice helps you become more aware of how your body feels and can be incredibly grounding.\n\nMindful Eating: Instead of eating in front of the TV or while scrolling through your phone, try eating mindfully. Pay attention to the colors, textures, and flavors of your food. Take smaller bites and savor each one. This not only improves your mindfulness but also helps with digestion and portion control.\n\nMindful Walking: Whether you’re taking a short walk during lunch or strolling through nature, use the opportunity to practice mindfulness. Pay attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sounds around you, and the sigh\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "6bd37619-8520-4e9f-b5e8-4d1b218f8a0d", "level_title": "11-Upper Intermediate", "label": 0}

One of the main parts is the fuselage, which is the body of the airplane it holds passengers, ,cargo, and the cockpit, where the pilots control the plane. the fuselage is designed to be strong and aerodynamic, allowing the airplane to cut through the air efficiently.\nThe wings are another critical part of the airplane. They provide lift, which is the force that allows the plane to stay in the air. The wings are designed with special shapes to create a difference in air pressure above and below them, resulting in lift. The flaps on the wings can be adjusted to control the airplane's speed and altitude.\nThe tail of the airplane consists of the vertical stabilizer and horizontal stabilizer. \nFinally, the engines provide the thurst needed to move the airplane forward.\nEach of these parts plays an essential role in making air travel possible and safe.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: Research Proposal – Springfield University Project\n\nSpringfield University is proposing a three-month qualitative research project, scheduled to begin in the fall semester, to explore first-year students' attitudes toward traditional classroom learning versus online learning environments.\n\nThe study will include both mature students and recent school leavers entering university for the first time. The primary objective is to understand how these student groups perceive the two modes of instruction and what factors influence their preferences.\n\nAdditionally, the research will investigate students’ interest in attending virtual classes during vacation periods. It will examine how often they would be willing to participate, and why, considering both practical and emotional motivations as well as educational needs.\n\nThe insights gathered will support the university in evaluating the feasibility of developing a virtual classroom or campus, by providing evidence-based feedback on student demand, expectations, and concerns.\n\nInsight Strategic Research is committed to delivering a comprehensive, methodologically sound study tailored to Springfield University’s institutional goals, ensuring actionable results that can guide decision-making on future educational strategies.", "task_id": "bf43a9ca-521f-4f13-bdbe-414077f8b33f", "level_title": "Research", "label": 5}

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: As a new manager, motivating your team effectively is key to fostering productivity, engagement, and trust. Start by building strong relationships with your team. Show genuine interest in their career goals and provide opportunities for growth through training and mentorship. Clear communication is vital—set clear goals, outline expectations, and ensure everyone understands their role in achieving team objectives.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Free writing is often considered a foundational technique in the writing process due to its liberating nature. By setting aside concerns about correctness or coherence, writers can focus purely on the act of writing, allowing their subconscious to surface ideas that might be stifled by self-editing. This uninhibited flow of thoughts can be particularly useful in overcoming writer's block—a common challenge where the pressure to produce perfect prose prevents any prose from being produced at all.\n\nThe beauty of free writing lies in its unpredictability. Writers often find themselves exploring tangents or uncovering themes they hadn’t initially considered. This can lead to unexpected connections between ideas, providing a rich tapestry of material to draw from in later stages of writing. Once the raw material is generated, writers can start identifying patterns or themes that resonate, using techniques like symbolism to add depth or metaphor to convey complex emotions and ideas more vividly.\n\nAfter free writing, focused free writing can be employed to hone in on specific aspects of the text that seem promising. This involves taking the initial stream of consciousness and directing it towards a particular topic or theme, allowing writers to develop and elaborate on ideas that emerged during the initial free writing session.\n\nLoop writing is another technique that builds on the foundation of free writing. It involves taking a single idea or sentence from the free writing piece and using it as a prompt for another round of writing. This iterative process can deepen exploration and understanding, leading to more nuanced content.\n\nListing is another technique that can complement free writing. By creating lists related to themes, characters, or settings, writers can organize their thoughts and identify elements that need more development. This can lead to a clearer structure when drafting more formal versions of their work.\n\nHyperbole and metaphor can be particularly effective in refining the emotional impact and expressive power of the writing. Hyperbole, with its exaggerated statements, can emphasize key points or evoke strong feelings, while metaphor can encapsulate complex ideas in relatable imagery, creating a bridge between the abstract and the tangible.\n\nSymbolism adds another layer of meaning to writing. By embedding symbols into a narrative, writers can convey themes and messages subtly, inviting readers to interpret and find deeper significance in the text.\n\nIn essence, while free writing provides the raw material and initial inspiration, these other techniques serve as tools to refine, structure, and enrich the writing, allowing for a more polished and impactful final product. Each technique has its place in the writing process, and the most effective writers often employ a combination, depending on the needs of their work and the message they wish to convey.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: Police and Immigration [SEP] Prompt: Now prepare the content for an informative web page about counterfeit goods. Be sure to keep the following points in mind: Types of counterfeit goods, the effect of counterfeiting on society, the signs of a fake, what to do if you discover fake goods.  Write 250-300 words. [SEP] Response: Understanding Counterfeit Goods\nCounterfeit goods are fake items that are made to look like genuine products. They cover a wide range of categories including luxury items (like designer clothing and handbags), electronics, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and even food and beverages. These fakes can be very convincing, making it challenging for consumers to differentiate between real and counterfeit products.\n\nTypes of Counterfeit Goods\nLuxury Goods: High-end brands such as designer clothing, bags, watches, and jewelry.\n\nElectronics: Gadgets like smartphones, tablets, and accessories.\n\nPharmaceuticals: Medicines and health supplements.\n\nCosmetics: Beauty products, including makeup and skincare items.\n\nFood and Beverages: Packaged foods and alcoholic drinks.\n\nEffects of Counterfeiting on Society\nThe impact of counterfeiting on society is profound and far-reaching. It undermines legitimate businesses, leading to significant revenue losses and job cuts. Counterfeit goods often fail to meet safety standards, posing serious health risks to consumers. For instance, fake pharmaceuticals can have life-threatening consequences. Additionally, the counterfeit trade is frequently linked to organized crime, funding illicit activities and contributing to broader societal issues like violence and corruption.\n\nSigns of a Fake\nIdentifying counterfeit goods requires vigilance. Common signs include poor quality materials, misspelled brand names, and missing serial numbers or authenticity labels. Unusually low prices that seem too good to be true often signal fakes. Packaging that looks different from the original or lacks proper branding can also be a giveaway.\n\nWhat to Do If You Discover Fake Goods\nIf you suspect that you have purchased counterfeit goods, report it immediately to the retailer and the brand owner. Avoid using the product, especially if it is a health-related item. Consumers can also report the incident to local consumer protection agencies and law enforcement authorities. Public awareness and swift reporting play crucial roles in combating the spread of counterfeit products.", "task_id": "788dc6fa-5111-4a7c-b2c1-a9ddebd0b1a2", "level_title": "Police and Immigration", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find **focused free writing**, **listing**, and **questioning** to be the most useful for my writing process. Focused free writing helps me develop ideas around a specific topic without worrying about structure or grammar, allowing creativity to flow while still staying on track. It’s especially helpful when I’m trying to explore a theme or prepare a rough draft. Listing is also incredibly effective—it helps me organize thoughts, break down complex topics, and create a clear plan before I start writing. I often use it to brainstorm supporting points or examples. Questioning is useful when I’m stuck or need to look at a topic from different perspectives; asking who, what, when, where, why, and how can lead to deeper thinking and uncover new angles I hadn’t considered. While techniques like metaphor and symbolism are great for creative or descriptive writing, I rely more on practical tools that help me structure and expand my ideas effectively. Combining focused free writing, listing, and questioning allows me to generate content quickly while ensuring clarity and depth.\n", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Aviation [SEP] Prompt: Summarize the report, using your own words. Write 8-10 lines. Compare your text with the model. [SEP] Response: On June 13, 2010, at 1818 Pacific Daylight Time, InterStar Airways Flight 293, landed at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), San Francisco, California, with the nose wheels cocked at 90 degrees. InterStar Airways was operating the airplane as a scheduled domestic passenger flight. The captain, first officer, four flight attendants, and 141 passengers were not injured. The flight departed Oakland, California, at 1531 as a non-stop to Sky Harbor International Airport, Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nThe captain noted no problems during the initial departure, and observed a positive rate of climb. The flight crew noted an error message displayed on the control board. There was a fault message for a nose landing gear shock absorber.  The data indicated that the gear handle was positioned to the down position, and there was an error message of a fault for the nose wheel steering.  \n\nThe flight diverted to San Jose, California. The captain was asked to perform a flyby of the tower for verification on the gear status. The tower, InterStar ground personnel, and a local news helicopter advised him that the nose gear was cocked 90 degrees to the left. When he found out this information, the captain decided to divert to SFO because it had optimum field conditions, a longer runway, and a better emergency support services. The crew flew for several hours to burn fuel so that they could land at a lighter weight.\n\nThe captain advised the cabin crew that in the event that the nose gear collapsed, evacuation from the front doors was not available so everyone would deplane from the rear exits. The flight crew continually updated the cabin crew and passengers about the situation, and advised the cabin crew to prepare for emergency procedures.  \n\nThe captain flew the airplane for the landing. He touched down at 120 knots, and applied normal braking at 90 knots. He held the nose gear off of the ground as long as possible. At 60 knots, the flight crew shut down the engines. They did not use reverse thrust or auto-braking. During the landing, the forward cabin crew could smell burnt rubber. The air traffic control tower confirmed that there was no fire, and the captain announced this to the cabin crew. After this notification, the passengers deplaned normally using an air stair.\n\nUpon touchdown, the tires rapidly deflated and tore apart, and both wheels were worn into the axle. During landing, the airplane's trajectory was not affected by the abnormal configuration or subsequent tire destruction, and the airplane stayed on the runway centerline.

It sounds like both work and your relationship are causing you a lot of stress, and I can understand why you're feeling overwhelmed.\n\nWith work, it’s frustrating when management doesn’t seem to value the effort you put in. I’d suggest having an honest conversation with them, if you can. Sometimes they may not be aware of how their actions (or lack thereof) are impacting morale. If that doesn’t help, maybe it’s worth considering if the environment is something you can live with long-term or if it’s time to look for a change.\n\nAs for Tia, breakups are never easy, especially when you thought things were going well. It’s okay to feel down, but remember that sometimes things don’t work out for reasons that are out of our control. Take some time to reflect on the relationship and what you’ve learned from it. Lean on friends or hobbies that help you recharge.\n\nIt’s completely normal to feel a bit lost right now, but know that you’re not alone.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a rapidly developing, becoming a big topic of discussion in recent years. It is a concept that has attracted worldwide attention. Due to the demands for enhanced transparency, CSR started to embrace social, ethical as well as environmental challenges. Today, companies are aware of the social and environmental impacts of international production. It is accepted that Companies should not be only profitable, but also have to promote good value in terms of social responsability.\n\nCSR within multinational companies is seen as a vehicle through which larger, well-known corporations can contribute to the wellbeing of developing countries by operating responsibly in terms of social and environmental issues. In more and more companies, initiatives to improve the lives of employees are multiplying, for example company nurseries, promotion of smart working for a correct work-life balance. \nOn the other hand, there are initiatives that have a significant impact on the environment, such as the use of renewable energy, the abolition of plastic.\n\n\nHowever, in some cases very little is known about the companies’ CSR policies and practices in an international context. As reality shows, most of the larger corporations abuse the CSR and behave unethically and irresponsibly towards both society and the environment. Issues such as unsafe working conditions, unfair payment, gender discrimination, toxic emissions and the hazardous pollution of water and soil have all raised fair allegations by consumers, non-governmental organizations and the larger society.\n\nTo sum up, I believe that CSR should be an innate part of business operations, based on transparent values. Only in this way stakeholders and customers can trust the company.\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: Fueling Success: The Power of a Free Breakfast\nImagine a morning where the day's biggest decision isn't \"scramble or cereal?\" but \"pancakes or pastries?\" This is the reality our company is ushering in with its new free breakfast program. Gone are the frantic mornings of juggling breakfast with the morning commute, replaced by a communal gathering fueled by fresh fruit, steaming coffee, and the camaraderie of colleagues.\nThis isn't just about nourishment; it's an investment in our collective well-being. Studies have shown that a healthy breakfast improves focus, boosts energy levels, and enhances overall productivity. By providing this vital meal, the company demonstrates a genuine commitment to employee happiness and success.\nFurthermore, the breakfast room becomes a vibrant hub of social interaction.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying homes is one of big making decisions in our life, I think. I do not know all cases when we buy house in our country. However, as far as I have known, most cases that people purchase some home here, they seem to borrow big amount of money from someone. People must make a long-term contract to pay back loan to their bank after they borrow money. Bank as itself, has not to turn losses after it decides to finance their customers, therefore, banks request their potential customers to submit all kind of documents and certificates to examine them closely in terms of their solvencies, reliabilities, and trustfulness. This process is sometimes very difficult for some people and not so much for others. Once people get approval for their loan and they are obliged to pay back all until they die or with their deaths. I think that the rate of interest in long term has not been at quite high level, which makes us to purchase our homes easily. However, this situation also applied to other country people to buy house in our country. The market of homes in our country has been active and brisk, which has kept the value of house higher than before, especially inside of Tokyo.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 2}

[SEP] Response: New York City vs. Bogotá: A Tale of Two Cities\nNew York City, often called \"the city that never sleeps,\" is a bustling metropolis known for its towering skyscrapers, cultural diversity, and fast-paced lifestyle. It is home to iconic landmarks such as Times Square, Central Park, and the Statue of Liberty. The city's public transportation system, particularly the subway, makes commuting convenient. Additionally, NYC offers countless job opportunities and a vibrant arts scene, attracting millions of visitors and residents from around the world.\n\nIn contrast, Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, has a unique charm that blends history and modernity. Unlike New York, Bogotá is situated high in the Andes Mountains, offering a cooler climate. It is famous for its colonial architecture, cultural richness, and delicious traditional food such as ajiaco and empanadas. While public transportation is improving, it is not as extensive as New York’s subway. However, Bogotá has a strong sense of community, and its people are warm and welcoming.\n\nBoth cities have their own appeal—New York dazzles with its energy and opportunities, while Bogotá offers a rich cultural experience and a slower pace of life. Ultimately, the best choice depends on one’s lifestyle and preferences.", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Law [SEP] Prompt: Review your notes and write a case report stating who was found guilty and why. Briefly comment on whether you found the verdict appropriate. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Breaking and entering is a crime that occurs when an individual enters another person's dwelling or remains there against the will of the person who normally resides there.\n\nAt this point, the question that comes to mind is clear: What is considered a dwelling? To answer this question, we must turn to the Supreme Court's case law, and not just to one ruling, but to several, since the concept of residence has been modified and refined over time.\n\nIf we want to see a definition of residence, we must turn to Supreme Court Ruling 1108/1999, of September 6, which states: \"The home is the closed, legitimately occupied place where private, individual, or family life takes place, even if the occupation is temporary or accidental.\"\n\nTherefore, following this ruling, we cannot confuse it with the habitual residence, as it is a broader concept. This can be seen in Supreme Court Ruling 3620/2020, which refers to second homes, stating:\n\n\"The complainant, in her testimony, answered, in response to questions from the defense, that she no longer lived in that house. It is clear from the rest of the information provided in her statement that what she was saying was that the property did not have the status of a habitual residence because it did not It met the minimum conditions of habitability, although it is indisputable that she had left the property in the morning and returned at night, carrying out her private and domestic life within it. Therefore, it was not simply a place where she kept some belongings, nor an open space, indiscriminately available to third parties.\n\nShe had the keys to the property, and therefore the possibility of protecting her private life from the intrusion of third parties whom she could demand not to enter or leave. Therefore, there can be no doubt that, even if she were not the owner, and even regardless of whether or not it constituted her \"sole\" residence or her domicile in the sense of \"habitual residence,\" it constituted a dwelling for criminal purposes.\n\n\n", "task_id": "bb0d114c-9550-4f27-9138-b2eb14c39437", "level_title": "Law", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become an essential part of modern business practice, reflecting companies' growing recognition of their role in addressing societal and environmental challenges. In my opinion, CSR is no longer just a moral obligation but a strategic necessity for businesses in today’s interconnected world.\n\nFirst, CSR helps build a positive company reputation. Consumers are increasingly aware of the social and environmental impact of their purchasing decisions, and they are more likely to support companies that demonstrate a commitment to ethical practices. By integrating sustainability into their operations, companies can attract a loyal customer base and differentiate themselves from competitors.\n\nAdditionally, CSR contributes to long-term business success. Businesses that prioritize employee well-being, community development, and environmental protection are more likely to foster innovation, reduce operational risks, and create a positive work culture. These factors not only enhance productivity but also improve employee retention, reducing turnover costs.\n\nHowever, CSR should not be viewed as a mere marketing tool or a way to improve public relations. It must be an authentic and integral part of a company’s values and operations. When CSR efforts are perceived as superficial or insincere, it can lead to consumer skepticism and damage a company’s reputation.\n\nIn conclusion, CSR is an opportunity for businesses to positively impact society while also benefiting themselves. When approached with sincerity and commitment, CSR initiatives can drive both social change and corporate growth.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: **Abstract**\nThis study evaluates the anticipated impacts of the proposed Sun Valley Dam on the local West Indian sloth populations using advanced principal component (PC) simulations. We modeled key environmental variables—habitat area, food resource diversity, and related ecological factors—to predict sloth livelihood outcomes following dam completion. Repeated simulation runs identified two primary drivers of population decline: significant habitat loss due to inundation and a marked reduction in food variety downstream of the dam. These factors are predicted to synergistically undermine sloth survival and reproduction rates. To mitigate potential ecological catastrophe, we recommend proactively relocating affected sloth populations to the adjacent Corona Valley prior to dam construction. This preemptive strategy aims to preserve genetic diversity and prevent local extirpation.\n", "task_id": "76bba4e9-a91a-49e2-89a6-129b5a013873", "level_title": "Sciences", "label": 5}

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: ---\n\nParts of an Airplane\n\nAn airplane is made up of several important parts that work together to make it fly. The main part is the fuselage, which is the body of the airplane. It holds the cockpit, where the pilots sit, and the cabin, where passengers and cargo are placed. The wings are large surfaces attached to both sides of the fuselage. They are essential for flight because they create lift when the airplane moves through the air.\n\nAt the back of the airplane is the tail, also called the empennage. The tail helps keep the airplane stable and includes parts like the horizontal and vertical stabilizers, which control the plane’s direction and balance. Finally, the engines are usually located on the wings or the fuselage. They provide the thrust needed to push the airplane forward, allowing it to gain speed and lift off the ground.\n\nAll these parts work together to help the airplane fly safely and smoothly from one place to another.\n\n\n---\n\n", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: An airplane has several key parts that work together to make flights possible. The fuselage is the main body of the aircraft. It holds the cockpit, where the pilots sit, as well as the passengers and cargo. The wings are attached to the sides of the fuselage and provide lift when air flows over them, allowing the airplane to rise into the sky.\nAt the back of the airplane is the tail, which includes the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. These parts help keep the airplane balanced and stable in flight. The horizontal stabilizer controls the pitch ( up and down movement), while the vertical stabilizer controls the yaw (side-to-side movement).\nThe engines are usually located under the wings or the fuselage. They provide the thrust needed to move the airplane forward. As the airplane speeds up, the air flowing over the wings creates lift.\n\nTogether, these parts allow the airplane to fly, turn, climb, and descend safely and efficiently", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 4}

As she stood there, trying to figure out what was going on, the lights in the room flickered and then dimmed. \n\nSuddenly, she felt the tap again, this time on her wrist.

Before the internet became widespread, traditional forms of media like newspapers, magazines, and television were the primary sources of news and entertainment. People would wait for evening news broadcasts or pick up a newspaper to stay informed; now, news is constantly accessible on smartphones, social media, and websites.

This shift has affected my reading habits—while I still enjoy books, I often read shorter pieces of content now, like blog posts or social media updates. The immediacy of digital media has made me crave quick information and constant updates; it’s easier than ever to consume, but harder to focus for long periods.

[SEP] Response: It seems you can’t open up a magazine or turn on the TV these days without seeing some celebrity or other endorsing a product, championing a cause, or being appointed as an ambassador for some well-known international charity or non-profit organization.\n\nTo the cynics, this is simply a case of media-hogging opportunists who have jumped on a voguish bandwagon in order to earn big bucks, indirectly boost a flagging career, or promote a book or movie in the works. Media-savvy celebrities, claim supporters of this view, are all too familiar with the power of publicity, be it good or bad. Understanding the power of the press and increasingly the immediacy of cyberspace, they have learned to mercilessly exploit these domains for purposes far less noble than their publicists would have us believe. And so their pious posturing comes down to nothing more than smoke and mirrors — crass publicity stunts— designed to keep the stars in the spotlight they and their careers so desperately crave.\n\nFor the more idealistic at heart, the landscape appears more uplifting. Celebrities who ‘give back’ do so because of their innate benevolence, their passion for the latest cause celebre, or their desire to show their gratitude for what they themselves now have. Their support for a brand, a humanitarian cause, or some eco-friendly gadget or device shows the rest of us a model to emulate, and nourishes our belief in their goodness if not their status as superhuman.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature that captivates imaginations across many cultures is the dragon. Known for its majestic and fearsome presence, dragons are often depicted as large, serpentine creatures with wings, scales, and the ability to breathe fire. In Western folklore, they are typically seen as malevolent beings hoarding treasure, dwelling in caves or atop mountains, and challenging brave knights. The dragon's symbolism in the West often revolves around themes of chaos and destruction, representing a formidable force that heroes must conquer.\n\nConversely, in Eastern traditions, dragons are revered as benevolent and wise creatures. In Chinese mythology, dragons are associated with water and weather, controlling rainfall and rivers, and are considered symbols of power, strength, and good fortune. They are often depicted with antler-like horns and a long, snake-like body, embodying the harmony of nature. Dragons are celebrated during festivals, such as the Dragon Boat Festival, where they are honored with vibrant rituals and races.\n\nThis dichotomy between Eastern and Western depictions of dragons highlights the fascinating diversity in cultural storytelling, where the same creature can embody vastly different traits and morals across regions.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: \nThe concept of celebrity has become increasingly problematic in our society. Celebrities are often idolized to an unhealthy degree, creating unrealistic standards and expectations. This idolization can lead to a culture where superficial qualities are valued over genuine talent and hard work. For instance, many celebrities are celebrated more for their appearance or social media presence than for any substantial contributions to their field. This can be particularly damaging to young people, who may feel pressured to emulate these often unattainable standards.\n\nMoreover, the constant media scrutiny that celebrities face can have detrimental effects on their mental health. The relentless pursuit of fame and the invasion of privacy can lead to stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues. This not only affects the celebrities themselves but also sets a harmful example for the public, suggesting that fame and success come at the cost of personal well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, while celebrities can inspire and entertain, the culture of celebrity worship needs to be re-evaluated. We should strive to appreciate individuals for their genuine achievements and character rather than their fame or appearance. By doing so, we can foster a healthier, more balanced society.\n\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

It features vibrant plumage with a blend of emerald green and deep blue, contrasting with the more subdued orange and gray tones of the American robin. Its slender beak and slightly elongated tail give it a more elegant appearance.\n\nIn terms of habitat, while the American robin is commonly found in North American woodlands and urban areas, the Sylvaticus emeritus thrives in dense, tropical rainforests. It prefers the canopies, nesting in tall trees, and feeding on a variety of insects and fruits, unlike the American robin, which often forages on the ground.\n\nZoological Classification:\n\nKingdom: Animalia\n\nPhylum: Chordata\n\nClass: Aves\n\nOrder: Passeriformes\n\nFamily: Turdidae\n\nGenus: Sylvaticus\n\nSpecies: Sylvaticus emeritus\n\nSuggested Name and Rationale: The name \"Sylvaticus emeritus\" is apt for this species as \"Sylvaticus\" denotes its affinity for forested habitats, and \"emeritus\" signifies its distinguished and exceptional appearance among avian species.

[SEP] Response: Hang Seng Index Performance: A Snapshot of Hong Kong’s Stock Market Trends\n\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI), one of Asia's most prominent stock market indices, has recently shown a mixed performance, reflecting a volatile global economic environment. Over the past year, the HSI has experienced significant fluctuations, largely driven by external factors such as geopolitical tensions, global inflation concerns, and shifting investor sentiment in China.\n\nIn the first quarter of this year, the HSI saw a moderate uptick, with key sectors like technology and consumer goods showing strong growth. However, the index faced setbacks in the subsequent months, as concerns over China’s economic slowdown and tighter regulations on big tech companies dampened investor confidence. Despite these challenges, the HSI has shown resilience, maintaining a recovery trend toward the end of the year.\n\nLooking at the performance graph, it's evident that the index struggled to break past major resistance levels, but it remains a barometer for market sentiment in Hong Kong. Analysts believe that the HSI's future performance will depend on the broader global economic recovery, stability in China’s markets, and ongoing regulatory developments.\n\nOverall, while the HSI remains a key indicator for investors, navigating the current volatility requires caution and strategic investment decisions.", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 5}

The first law, passed in 1906, regulated drug production and content. This legislation underwent several changes until 1938, when it was revised to require that drugs be safe for human use. Manufacturers were required to demonstrate the efficacy of their drugs, and standards were established for the manufacturing and prescription of addictive substances, particularly those with potential for abuse. Drug manufacturers must submit samples of new drugs to FDA laboratories for testing, and product labeling must be approved before the drugs can be sold.\n\nThis also applies to non-prescription medications. For example, a warning label is now required on products containing acetaminophen, stating that it can cause liver damage when taken in high doses or combined with large amounts of alcohol.\n\n", "task_id": "d3ead51b-9893-419c-9bbf-4006296fadf9", "level_title": "Pharmacy", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Although advances in robotics are the favourite topic of conversation amongst the media, these seem to be a rare sight in most nations of Latin America. Third world countries can only get their grasp on the crumbs that the rest of the world gets rid of once they find a shinier machine to focus on. \n\nThat being said, even with such scarce resources, technological innovations accomplish to reach Latin-Americans through unexpected ways. In populations in which you may be more fixated on getting dressed and feeding your family, the local business have adapted their technology to the demand. AI can be seen in the images printed in mugs and shirts, as, to distinguish themselves, designers generate images through digital platforms that merge already existing art into a new illustration for their business. Due to the limited budget people can allocate to indulge into their hobbies, you may prefer to buy a 3D printed figure of your favourite movie character rather than opting for the official and more expensive version of this item.\n\nThis pattern seems to be evolving however, as the persons that are able to access these tools are venturing into producing items to address more important matters. 3D printed prosthetic arms, for example, allow those who need them the most to move through their day-to-day lives without breaking the bank. Softwares that mimic speech enable new connection opportunities to those with speech impediments, or even those that may speak a different language altogether. \n\nAt the end of the day, it is within the human nature to make-do with what the world gives us, and it only takes a little bit of genius to bend these opportunities and uncover the path for a better future.", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Motivating a team effectively starts with understanding what drives each individual. Start by building trust—take time to listen and learn about your team members’ strengths, goals, and challenges. Recognize good work consistently; even small wins deserve acknowledgment. A simple \"thank you\" or public praise can go a long way.\n\nSet clear, achievable goals and involve your team in decision-making where possible. This gives them ownership and boosts engagement. Also, create opportunities for growth—offer stretch assignments or support their learning paths.\n\nAvoid micromanaging—it signals a lack of trust and can demotivate even high performers. Similarly, steer clear of one-size-fits-all approaches; what works for one person may not inspire another. Lastly, don’t ignore conflict or underperformance. Address issues early and constructively to maintain morale and team cohesion.\n\nMotivation is an ongoing process, not a one-time action. Keep communication open, stay approachable, and lead by example. Your team will reflect the energy and attitude you bring every day.\n\nBest of luck,\nEF Student", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 4}

I can also divide leaders in two categories: 1 - leader who received the gift of leadership when they was born\n2- leaders who work hard on their strenghts to maximize them and work more than hard to their weaknesses to make them strenghts.\nYou can recognize leaders on the 1st category , because usually they do not like to show off or boast, but by their gift people follow them regardless. \nUsually they are beautiful and with a sort of aura around them. When they speak, they kidnap and inspire you. \nThe 2nd category of leaders , is composed by people who has some good basic characteristics to work on to become a successful leader. \nA good leader is not arrogant or rude, but friendly and polite . In addition is  very important that he or she can  recognize his or her  faults or to take the blame for his or her  team’s mistakes in front of others.

[SEP] Response: Buying a home in Brazil can be a very exciting but also difficult experience. The process is not very fast and has many steps. First, it is important to find a house or apartment that you like and that is in your budget. Sometimes people use a real estate agent to help, but is not obligatory. You can also search by yourself on websites or apps.\nTo buy a house with a loan, you need to go to a bank and apply for a home loan. This part can be stressful because you need to give a lot of documents. Banks usually ask for ID, proof of address, work contract, last payslips and tax declarations. The forms are long and have many questions. If one information is wrong, the bank can not approve your loan.\nHousing in Brazil is not cheap, especially in big cities like São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro. Prices can be very high and not all families can buy a property.

It is the legend of the Nahual. The Nahual is an ordinary person who lives among us but possesses supernatural powers obtained by making a pact with the devil in exchange for their soul.\n\nA Nahual can transform into different creatures such as wolves, coyotes, dogs, and even birds like vultures. In a way, this legend is similar to the European werewolf legends, and just like in those legends, if you kill or injure a Nahual transformed into an animal, it is likely that the next day you will find a person injured or dead with the wound in the same place.\n\nDespite their existence among us, Nahuales are adept at eluding detection. Commonly, on social media and in newspapers, there are often news or blurry photos claiming to be sightings of Nahuales, but skeptics always dismiss these photos due to their quality or because they are manipulated. There are also numerous encounters reported by people who claim to have seen Nahuales in person, further fueling the mystique surrounding their existence\n\nFinally, the legend of the Nahuales enriches the culture and identity of Mexico.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Compare your amendment with the model. This is a non-graded activity. [SEP] Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned.

[SEP] Response: When comparing Tokyo and New York City, it’s easy to see why they are often considered two of the most iconic metropolises in the world.

It’s meticulously clean and orderly, with an incredible public transport system that runs with precision. The culture emphasizes respect and harmony, making it feel safe and welcoming, even in a city of nearly 14 million people. From futuristic neighborhoods like Akihabara to serene shrines in Meiji Jingu, Tokyo blends its modern innovation with deep-rooted traditions. And, of course, its food—from sushi to ramen—is world-famous.\n\nNew York City, on the other hand, thrives on its raw energy and vibrancy. It’s loud, dynamic, and unapologetically chaotic in the best way. The subway system may not have Tokyo’s level of efficiency, but it connects people to neighborhoods brimming with unique personalities, from the art-filled streets of Brooklyn to the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan. NYC feels like the center of the world, a melting pot of cultures where ambition and creativity are celebrated.\n\nWhile Tokyo feels like a symphony—precise, harmonious, and polished—New York is more like jazz: unpredictable, soulful, and alive.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language students face many challenges to acquire a new one and use it comfortably. At the start of the journey, it can be easy to get frustrated as things don’t go as planned, mainly because you enter a new world of vocabulary that seems alien as first. But that doesn't stop in knowing only the new words but learning how to pronounce it and the structure of the language which can get quite difficult depending on your native language and the one you’re learning.\nA way to get better at this and help with the further development of this new ability is to join an academy, where you have teachers that know how to put things together, so you realize things were not as difficult as they seemed at first. And we cannot underestimate the help that brings having practices with classmates about exercises and even more for speaking. It’s amazing how much it could help.\nBut even if you don’t have access to an academy, with the help of Internet you can reach thousand of videos and content that can get you through this development and giving you an amazing opportunity to learn wherever you are.

It describes different trends in three modes of transportation: public transportation, air travel and space travel.\n\nThe trends discussed in public transportation show that there is a change in behavior among young people. Studies indicate an increase in the use of public transportation and a decrease in cars for personal use. The reasons for this change are the attachment to electronic devices, the desire to be more productive during the commute, and the increased sensitivity in transportation sustainability.\n\nThe trends in air travel seem to be to cut costs. This also means that airlines can run budget flights, so air travel remains a viable and economical mode of mid- to long-distance transportation.\n\nThe last and most intriguing mode of transportation discussed in the article is space travel. Space tourism is gaining popularity; however, it is limited only to those who can afford it. Will there be mass tourism in space travel in the future?

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In Saudi Arabia, robots are becoming increasingly integrated into various sectors. From hospitality to healthcare, they are transforming the way services are delivered. For instance, in the hospitality industry, robots are used to greet guests, manage check-ins, and even serve food. In healthcare, robots assist in surgeries, provide support in elderly care, and help with administrative tasks. I feel that the rise of robots in society brings both opportunities and challenges. Positively, robots can enhance efficiency, reduce human error, and perform tasks that are dangerous for humans. They can also contribute to economic growth by creating new job opportunities in tech and robotics. On the downside, the increasing use of robots could lead to job displacement for workers in traditional roles, and there are ethical concerns about privacy and the extent of automation in our lives.

There aren't any excuse for Mr. Medina's behavior.  In addition, there wasn't any claim for robbery, so it wasn't possible to charge damages to Mr. Medina.

Remember to take a stand on the proposal and support your position with reasons and examples. Type in the input box. Write 45-70 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Opinion on the Proposal to Replace Physical Education with Test Preparation Classes\n\nI strongly disagree with the proposal to cut physical education and sports classes in favor of year-long test preparation classes. While preparing students for standardized tests is important, this approach overlooks the holistic development that physical education (PE) and sports provide to students.\n\nPhysical and Mental Health Benefits: Physical education plays a critical role in promoting students' physical health by encouraging regular exercise, which can help prevent obesity and other health-related issues. Moreover, physical activity is directly linked to improved mental health, reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, and enhancing overall mood and cognitive function. Removing PE could negatively impact students' health and well-being.\n\nDevelopment of Soft Skills: Sports and physical education are essential for developing soft skills such as teamwork, leadership, and communication. These skills are crucial for success in both personal and professional spheres. By eliminating these classes, we risk depriving students of opportunities to cultivate these important life skills.\n\nAcademic Performance: There is evidence suggesting that regular physical activity can improve academic performance. Exercise increases blood flow to the brain, which can enhance concentration and memory, ultimately supporting better performance in academic subjects, including those covered in test preparation classes.\n\nBalanced Education: Education should aim to develop well-rounded individuals. A curriculum heavily focused on test preparation at the expense of physical education and sports fails to provide a balanced education. Students benefit from diverse learning experiences that include both academic and physical components, promoting overall development.\nIn conclusion, while the importance of standardized tests cannot be denied, cutting physical education and sports classes is not the solution. Instead, schools should strive to integrate test preparation into a well-rounded curriculum that includes both academic and physical education. This approach would better serve the comprehensive needs of students, ensuring they are healthy, engaged, and well-prepared for future challenges.", "task_id": "8dab61c3-5199-4396-87e2-1618ae59b47a", "level_title": "7-Intermediate", "label": 5}

You think your colleagues would be interested in it and want to send them the link. Write them an email summarizing the three major areas of the article to interest them enough to read it. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Hi, guys.\n\nYou really must read this article. It describes different trends in three modes of transportation: public transportation, air travel and space travel.\n\nThe trends discussed in public transportation show that there is a change in behavior among young people. Studies indicate an increase in the use of public transportation and a decrease in cars for personal use. The reasons for this change are the attachment to electronic devices, the desire to be more productive during the commute, and the increased sensitivity in transportation sustainability.\n\nThe trends in air travel seem to be to cut costs. This also means that airlines can run budget flights, so air travel remains a viable and economical mode of mid- to long-distance transportation.\n\nThe last and most intriguing mode of transportation discussed in the article is space travel. Space tourism is gaining popularity; however, it is limited only to those who can afford it. Will there be mass tourism in space travel in the future? Well, it could happen sooner than we think.\n\nHope you enjoy the article!", "task_id": "ff0155e4-a137-4a41-a7b2-ebeaf0213c72", "level_title": "Travel Industry", "label": 4}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: About eight years ago, I went to dinner with a dear friend I had known for more than 10 years. It would be the last time we would see each other and by the end of that evening I was deeply shaken. But more lasting and more unsettling than this has been the feeling of loss without his friendship. It was a sudden ending but it was also an ending that lasted for me well beyond that evening. I have worried since then at what kind of friend I am to my friends, and why a friendship can suddenly self-destruct while others can so unexpectedly bloom.\n\nMy friend and I were used to going to dinner together, though it had become an increasingly tricky matter for us. We had been seeing each other more infrequently, and our conversations had been tending towards repetition. I still enjoyed his passion for talk, his willingness to be puzzled by life’s events, our comically growing list of minor ailments as we entered our sixties, and the old stories he fell back on — usually stories of his minor triumphs, such as the time his car burst into fire, was declared a write-off by insurance, and ended in an auction house where he bought it back with part of the insurance payout and only minor repairs to be made. There were stories of his time as a barman in one of Melbourne’s roughest pubs. I suppose in a lot of long-lasting friendships it is these repeated stories of the past that can fill the present so richly.", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Psychological Operations: Observations and Recommendations\nObservations: During the training exercise, psychological operations (PSYOP) were integrated into the overall mission strategy to influence the perception and behavior of the opposing forces. The key tactics included dissemination of persuasive messaging through various media channels and staged demonstrations to showcase our unit's capabilities. It was noted that the timing and content of these messages were critical in achieving the desired psychological impact. The use of loudspeakers and leaflet drops effectively conveyed disinformation, causing confusion and lowering the morale of the enemy. Additionally, mock operations and feints created the illusion of a larger force, thereby inducing hesitation and miscalculations in their response.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nEnhanced Coordination: Future PSYOP initiatives should involve closer coordination with intelligence units to ensure that messages are timely, accurate, and targeted.\n\nMedia Diversification: Expanding the range of media platforms utilized, including social media and digital communications, can increase the reach and effectiveness of psychological campaigns.\n\nCultural Sensitivity: Tailoring messages to the cultural and societal norms of the target audience can enhance credibility and impact.", "task_id": "1dc879f7-2765-4ba4-90f6-522fa596e03c", "level_title": "Military", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in Brazil can be a complex but achievable process. While it involves several steps and paperwork, it's generally manageable with the right guidance.\nProcess Difficulty and Forms: The process can be somewhat bureaucratic, requiring a significant amount of documentation from both the buyer and the seller, as well as the property itself. This includes personal documents, income proofs, property registrations, and various certificates. Filling out forms is a constant part of the journey, from loan applications to deed transfers.\nHousing Costs and Interest Rates: Housing in major urban centers is generally expensive, especially in sought-after neighborhoods. However, prices vary significantly across different regions and cities. Interest rates on home loans in Brazil have historically been higher compared to some developed countries, but they fluctuate based on the Selic rate (Brazil's benchmark interest rate) and market conditions.\nProfessional Assistance: It is highly recommended to use a real estate agent (corretor de imóveis) for finding properties and navigating the purchase process, as they offer valuable market insights and legal assistance. Engaging a mortgage broker (correspondente bancário) can also simplify the loan application process, as they can help compare options from various banks and assist with documentation.

Em algumas leituras percebo que aqueles que fazem poemas com uma linguagem mais simples e menos apurada são tachados de negligentes em relação à arte poética, o que achariam, esses críticos, dos poemas de Oswald de Andrade ou Mário Quintana se publicassem hoje?\n\n        Muitos críticos pregam o hermetismo poético, poema bom é poema ininteligível para a maioria. Eu não posso concordar, por minha militância na democratização da poesia. Democratização não é a facilitação. Não. É o convite através de uma linguagem mais simples, longe da simplória, àqueles que não têm o costume da leitura de poemas, ou usando um termo de um amigo meu: Pregar aos não convertidos. O meu sonho é que a poesia ganhe as ruas, de modo mais literal possível.\n\n        Não faço apologia à poema de má qualidade, descuidada, mas prego a diversidade de linguagem, já imaginaram as pessoas nos escritórios, nos salões de cabeleireiros, ou em qualquer outra parte conversando sobre poesia em vez de conversar sobre a novela das oito? Sonho? Se depender dos críticos sim, porque o preconceito social jamais permitirá que a poesia fosse algo popular e não de uma elite.\n\nFabiano Fernandes Garcez\nEnviado por Fabiano Fernandes Garcez em 16/09/2009\nCódigo do texto: T1813955\nLicença Creative Commons\nEsta obra está licenciada com uma Licença Creative Commons.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: The current situation of the Spanish real estate market is broadly characterised by the high demand for housing, especially new construction, and the shortage of supply. As a result of this mismatch between supply and demand, the price of housing continues to rise. The average price of new housing in Spain has reached €2,930/m² in June 2024, with large cities such as Barcelona (€5,262/m²) and Madrid (€4,493/m²) having the highest demand, the lowest supply and, consequently, the highest prices. All these factors, combined with the fact that the average salary in Spain is relatively low, around €2,200 gross per month, mean that most people have to apply for a bank loan to buy their home. \n\nIn Spain, you can buy a home through real estate agencies or from individual to individual. Buying a property from an individual offers personalised service and saves on commissions, while real estate agencies offer expert advice and speed up the paperwork. \n\nOnce you have found the perfect house, it is time to face the process of applying for a loan. The main requirements of banks when granting a mortgage have to do with the applicant's financial situation. In order to know the stability and good current and future financial solvency of the client, the bank asks for pay slips and work history, and checks that he or she has no other outstanding debts. \n\nA good tip when applying for a loan, is to compare different mortgage loan offers from different banking entities. During this process, you also have to decide which type of mortgage best fits your financial situation: \n- Fixed rate: the same installment and the same interest rate during the life of the mortgage. \n- Variable rate: the interest rate, and consequently the installment, vary depending on the reference index published by the banking entities, which is reviewed every 6 months. \n- Mixed rate: a fixed rate is applied during the first years of the loan and then a variable interest rate is applied.\n\nAnother aspect to take into account is the fees associated with the application and granting of the mortgage loan:\n- Opening fee: paid to the bank at the beginning of the loan for paperwork and management.\n- Account fee associated with the mortgage: opening an account, with associated fees, to manage the payment of the installments.\n\nIn addition, we must not forget that mortgages have a financing limit of up to 80% of the value of the property, as well as an amortization period ranging from 20 to 30 years. \n\nIn short, taking out a mortgage is a long process that requires taking time to carefully study the options and possibilities in order to obtain the best financing.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In India, robots are increasingly being used in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare and agriculture. In the manufacturing sector, robots automate production lines, enhancing speed and precision, particularly in the automotive industry. In healthcare, robots assist with surgeries, provide robotic prosthetics, improving access to medical services. In agriculture, robots and drones are being used for tasks like pesticides, irrigation and monitoring crops, which increases efficiency and reduces the need for manual labor.\n \nWhile these advancements offer significant benefits like increased productivity and improved quality of life, there are also potential downsides. The automation of jobs in low-skill sectors could lead to unemployment for a large portion of the population, particularly in rural areas. Furthermore, an overreliance on robots could erode essential human skills.\nSome benefits are as follows:\n1) Increased Productivity: Robots enhance efficiency and reduce human error,\n2) Improved Healthcare: Robots assist with surgeries, improving healthcare\n3) Agricultural Efficiency: Robots and drones help with planting, pesticides and crop monitoring, boosting agricultural productivity.\n4) Job Creation in Tech Fields: Growth in robotics and AI sectors can create new jobs in research, engineering, and software development.\n5) Cost Reduction: Automation in industries can lower operational costs,\n\nBut as said there are negative aspect too as below:\n1) Job Displacement: Automation could lead to unemployment, particularly for workers in low-skill sectors, creating a strain on the economy.\n2) Social Inequality: The adoption of robots might promote inequality as everything comes at cost.\n3) Overdependence on Technology: reduce human involvement, impacting decision-making and creativity.\n4) Ethical Concerns: The rise of robots in various sectors may raise issues around privacy, data security, and the ethical use of technology.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: As businesses operate in an increasingly interconnected world, corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become a vital aspect of their operations. In my opinion, CSR is not just a moral obligation, but a strategic imperative that benefits both companies and society.On one hand, CSR initiatives can enhance a company's reputation, foster customer loyalty, and attract top talent. By embracing sustainability, diversity, and community engagement, businesses can differentiate themselves and build trust with stakeholders. For instance, companies like Patagonia and REI have successfully integrated environmental responsibility into their brand identity, resonating with customers who share similar values.\nOn the other hand, CSR is not just about branding; it's about creating long-term value for all stakeholders. By investing in social and environmental initiatives, companies can mitigate risks, reduce costs, and drive innovation. Moreover, CSR can help businesses navigate complex regulatory landscapes and build stronger relationships with governments and communities.\n\nSome argue that CSR is a distraction from a company's core mission, but I disagree. By integrating social responsibility into their business models, companies can create shared value that benefits both shareholders and society. Ultimately, CSR is not a choice, but a business imperative that requires companies to balance profit with purpose. By embracing CSR, businesses can drive sustainable growth, build trust, and contribute to a better future for all.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Telecommunications [SEP] Prompt: A client who is thinking about expanding into the telecommunications industry has asked you to write a description of the current situation, including mergers, acquisitions and the different kinds of service providers. Write back to them about the state of the industry in your country, or internationally, it's up to you. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: \n\nTelecommunications\nTypes of telecommunications companies\nService providers\nThese companies provide local and long-distance wired telephone service, known to industry insiders as POTS – ‘plain old telephone service.’ wired providers include the large long-distance providers. A new generation of companies is laying fiber-optic wire networks to handle the rapidly increasing data traffic.\n\nWireless service providers\nThese companies have made it possible to communicate in the far corners of the earth where there’s no existing wireline infrastructure. Wireless communication uses technologies such as cordless telephones cellular telephones and satellites. Instead of wires and cables, radio waves sent through space are used as the medium for communication. An important characteristic of these companies is high consolidation of carriers and use of partnerships, which allows them to reach wider geographic areas and gain economies of scale.\n\nSatellite telecommunication services\nSatellite telecom services can be separated into fixed satellite services such as INTELSAT; low earth orbit companies (LEOs), which include Iridium and mega-LEO Teledesic; direct-broadcast satellite companies; and the global positioning system (GPS). Satellite services include everything from navigation systems used in automobiles to video broadcast and data transmission.\n\nInternet service providers (ISPs)\nThe internet has become an integral part of the telecommunications industry as voice and data networks converge. ISPs are the companies that make it possible for people to go online. They provide services like internet transit, domain name registration and hosting, software and leased line access and collocation. Recently the stock market for the telecommunications and IT-related industries has seen a downturn, causing many ISPs to face restructuring, takeovers and mergers.\n\nCustomer premise equipment (CPE) manufacturers\nCPE includes telecommunications equipment, such as telephones, fax machines, modems, voicemail systems, private branch exchanges (PBXs) and inside wiring located at a subscriber’s premises and connected with a carrier’s communication channels at the demarcation point. Telecommunication service providers are the main purchasers of telecommunications equipment.\n\nNetworking equipment and fiber optics manufacturers\nNetworking equipment includes the equipment that allows the local area network (LAN) to operate, including routers, hubs, switches and servers. Fiber optics consist of the optical fiber and fiber-optic cable, transmitters, receivers and connectors that carry data and voice messages.\n\nWireless and satellite communication equipment manufacturers\nThese are actually different categories grouped together for convenience, since the equipment for the different sectors is quite distinct.

{"text": "Prompt Level: Aviation [SEP] Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is made up of several important parts that each play a specific role in helping it fly safely and efficiently. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane. It holds the passengers, cargo, and cockpit where the pilots sit and control the aircraft. It connects all the other parts together.\n\nThe wings are essential for flight. They create lift when air moves over and under them, which helps the airplane rise into the sky and stay in the air. Most airplanes also have flaps and ailerons on the wings, which help control the direction and stability during flight.\n\nThe tail, or empennage, includes the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. It keeps the airplane balanced and helps control pitch (up and down movement) and yaw (side to side movement).\n\nFinally, the engines provide the thrust needed to move the airplane forward. They are usually located under the wings or on the back of the fuselage. Without engines, the plane wouldn’t be able to take off or maintain speed.\n\nEach of these parts works together to allow the airplane to take off, fly, and land safely.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a crucial aspect of modern business practices. It refers to companies taking responsibility for their impact on society and the environment, beyond their financial performance. Here’s my perspective on the importance of CSR:\n\nIntroduction: CSR is not just a buzzword; it is a fundamental component of sustainable business practices. Companies that embrace CSR can create a positive impact on society while also enhancing their own long-term success.\n\nArgument 1: One of the primary benefits of CSR is the improvement of a company's reputation. When businesses engage in ethical practices, support community initiatives, and reduce their environmental footprint, they build trust and loyalty among consumers. This positive image can lead to increased customer retention and attract new clients who prioritize ethical consumption.\n\nArgument 2: CSR initiatives can also lead to operational efficiencies and cost savings. For example, adopting sustainable practices such as reducing waste, conserving energy, and sourcing materials responsibly can lower operational costs. These savings can then be reinvested into the business or used to further CSR efforts, creating a virtuous cycle of improvement.\n\nArgument 3: Furthermore, CSR can enhance employee satisfaction and retention. Employees are increasingly seeking to work for companies that align with their personal values. By demonstrating a commitment to social and environmental responsibility, companies can attract and retain top talent, leading to a more motivated and productive workforce.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, CSR is not only beneficial for society and the environment but also for the businesses themselves. By integrating CSR into their core strategies, companies can build a positive reputation, achieve cost savings, and foster a loyal and motivated workforce. Embracing CSR is a win-win for all stakeholders involved.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Flexible schedules or remote work options can go a long way.\n\nListening: Feeling heard is huge. It creates an atmosphere of trust and respect. Even when employees vent or bring up problems, addressing those concerns can lead to greater satisfaction.\n\nAnd the “don’t” list is spot on too.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In the preceding units, we explored nine different writting techniques: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning, and cubing. Each technique offers unique ways to approach writing and can enhace creativity and clarity. Among these, free writing and questioning stand out as particularly useful to me. Free writing allows me to pour out thoughts without any constraints, enabling a flow of ideas and sparking new connections that might not surface through more structured writing. It's a great way to overcome writer0s block and explore different angles of a topic. Questioning, on the oother hand helps me delve deeper into a subject by prompting me to think critically about what I'm writing it encourages me to ask not just \"What\" but also \"Why\" and \"how\", which are essential for developing well-rounded argument or narrative. THese tehcniques complement each other well; free writing sets the stage for raw ideas, and questioning refines them by challenging assumptions and seeking deeper understanding.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, focused free writing and questioning stand out as particularly useful for my writing process. Focused free writing helps me organize my thoughts and maintain a sense of direction without losing momentum. By setting a specific topic or question at the beginning, I can explore ideas freely yet stay anchored to the main theme, making it ideal for overcoming writer's block or generating content on complex subjects. This technique offers a balance of creativity and structure that aligns well with my approach to writing.\n\nQuestioning, on the other hand, allows me to dive deeper into a topic by examining it from multiple angles. It prompts me to consider aspects I might otherwise overlook, leading to richer, more nuanced content. Asking \"why,\" \"how,\" and \"what if\" questions can uncover underlying motivations and perspectives, adding depth to my analysis. Combining these techniques—using questioning to expand ideas in a focused free write—can lead to insightful, well-rounded pieces.

O acesso ao aborto seguro é fundamental para proteger a saúde das mulheres.\n\n3. **Casos de Violência**: Em situações de violência sexual, como estupro, o aborto pode ser uma opção necessária para que a mulher não tenha que conviver com as consequências traumáticas da agressão.\n\n4. **Condições Socioeconômicas**: Muitas mulheres podem não ter condições financeiras ou de suporte para criar uma criança. A possibilidade de interromper uma gravidez indesejada pode ajudar a evitar ciclos de pobreza.\n\n5. **Saúde Fetal**: Em casos onde há diagnósticos de anomalias fetais graves, o aborto pode ser considerado uma opção para evitar sofrimento tanto para os pais quanto para a criança.\n\n6. **Legalidade e Segurança**: A legalização do aborto geralmente leva a práticas mais seguras, reduzindo o número de abortos inseguros que podem resultar em complicações graves ou morte.\n\n7. **Autonomia e Liberdade**: Defender o aborto é também defender o direito das mulheres de tomarem decisões sobre suas vidas e futuros, promovendo a igualdade de gênero.\n\nEsses são apenas alguns pontos que você pode usar em seu trabalho.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language can be an exciting yet challenging journey. Many language students face difficulties with pronunciation, grammar rules, and building vocabulary, especially when the new language is vastly different from their native one. One of the biggest hurdles is achieving fluency, which requires consistent practice and exposure to real-life conversations. Students often struggle with understanding native speakers who talk quickly or use slang, which isn’t always covered in textbooks. Additionally, the fear of making mistakes can lead to a lack of confidence, preventing learners from speaking or participating in conversations. Time commitment is another issue, as language learning requires regular practice, which can be hard to maintain with a busy schedule. Cultural differences can also create misunderstandings or confusion, adding another layer of complexity. Despite these challenges, with patience, motivation, and the right resources, learners can make steady progress and eventually become confident communicators in a new language.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Artificial intelligence is a field of science concerned with building computers and machines that can reason, learn, and act in such a way that would normally require human intelligence or that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze. \n\nAI is a broad field that encompasses many different disciplines, including computer science, data analytics and statistics, hardware and software engineering, linguistics, neuroscience, and even philosophy and psychology. \n\nOn an operational level for business use, AI is a set of technologies that are based primarily on machine learning and deep learning, used for data analytics, predictions and forecasting, object categorization, natural language processing, recommendations, intelligent data retrieval, and more.\n\nArtificial intelligence can be organized in several ways, depending on stages of development or actions being performed. \n\nFor instance, four stages of AI development are commonly recognized.\n\nReactive machines: Limited AI that only reacts to different kinds of stimuli based on preprogrammed rules. Does not use memory and thus cannot learn with new data. IBM’s Deep Blue that beat chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 was an example of a reactive machine.\nLimited memory: Most modern AI is considered to be limited memory. It can use memory to improve over time by being trained with new data, typically through an artificial neural network or other training model. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is considered limited memory artificial intelligence.\nTheory of mind: Theory of mind AI does not currently exist, but research is ongoing into its possibilities. It describes AI that can emulate the human mind and has decision-making capabilities equal to that of a human, including recognizing and remembering emotions and reacting in social situations as a human would.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Applying for a mortgage in Argentina is nearly impossible. Due to the instability of our currency, banks do not offer mortgages. Moreover, people do not want to compromise their savings for twenty-five years as it is difficult to plan that far ahead. The history of our country has made us precautious: we save all our money in a foreign currency, do not keep it in the banks, and high inflation encourages us to spend instead of saving due to how quickly prices increase. Additionally, governments do not keep steady policies.  \n\nLet’s imagine that mortgages did exist here, and were accesible, there would still be uncertainty. Let’s say that you manage to obtain an interview with the bank to apply. The banker reviews your bank statements, credit rating, and employment history concluding that you might qualify for a loan. However, they tell you that property values are in US dollars and that the loan is in Argentinian pesos. Therefore, if it happens that in between the time the loan was processed and you actually purchase the house, the foreign currency rate between ARS and USD dramatically increase, it might happen that the loan will not be enough to pay the property and the bank will not take any responsibility for that.  \n\nDue to these facts and the government not promoting such loans, many people resign to rent an apartment permanently. In the best scenario, you can save enough money in USD over the years to purchase a property without a mortgage.

While they are known to bless those who respect them, they can also bring misfortune to those who harm their habitats.

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane consists of several key parts that work together to ensure it can fly safely and efficiently. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane, providing space for passengers, cargo, and the cockpit where the pilots control the aircraft. It also serves as a structural frame that holds the other parts in place.\n\nThe wings are crucial for flight. They generate lift by moving air faster over the top surface than the bottom, creating an upward force that allows the plane to stay in the air. The shape and angle of the wings are carefully designed to provide the most efficient lift.\n\nThe tail of the airplane, also known as the empennage, consists of the horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer helps to keep the plane level and prevent pitching, while the vertical stabilizer controls the plane’s yaw, or side-to-side movement.\n\nFinally, the engines provide the thrust needed for the airplane to move forward. Most commercial airplanes use jet engines that take in air, compress it, mix it with fuel, and then expel it at high speed to propel the aircraft forward.\n\nEach of these parts works together to ensure the airplane can fly smoothly and safely.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "level_title": "Aviation", "label": 5}

Tokyo's culinary scene is unparalleled, offering everything from Michelin-starred sushi restaurants to humble ramen shops, ensuring a gastronomic adventure at every corner. The blend of traditional and modern is apparent in Tokyo, where ancient temples stand tall amidst futuristic buildings. The seamless integration of nature, such as the beautiful cherry blossoms in Ueno Park, adds to Tokyo's unique charm.\n\nIn contrast, Chennai, India, embodies a different kind of allure. Known for its rich cultural heritage, Chennai is a city where history and tradition are deeply embedded in its way of life. The bustling markets, vibrant festivals, and classical music and dance performances reflect the city's cultural richness. Chennai's Marina Beach, one of the longest urban beaches in the world, offers a serene escape from the urban hustle. The city's warm, tropical climate and the mouthwatering South Indian cuisine, including dishes like dosa and idli, add to its appeal. Unlike Tokyo's rapid pace, Chennai moves at a more relaxed and laid-back rhythm, allowing its residents to enjoy life at a leisurely pace.\n\nWhile Tokyo mesmerizes with its futuristic vibe and fast-paced lifestyle, Chennai captivates with its cultural depth and relaxed atmosphere.

Verbs: to put out - to raise - to turn off - to stop - to close - to keep - to get out [SEP] Response: Caía uma chuva miúda, quase pó! A luz mortiça dos candeeiros deixava antever traços finos e oblíquos de água fria. Alcina refugiou-se debaixo do toldo de uma velha loja de ferragens, fechada havia muitos anos. A noite não estava convidativa mas havia sempre quem estivesse disposto a comprar felicidade falsa e prazer duvidoso.\n\nTal como o antigo patrão que a iniciara naquela vida… Uma vida perdida ou talvez não. Doutra forma estaria, aos 36 anos, rodeada de um rancho de filhos que tinha de sustentar, um marido bêbado para aturar, o gado para tratar e as terras para amanhar.\n\nParou um carro. Saiu da cobertura, aproximou-se da janela que desceu lentamente. Entre sorrisos, disparou um costumado cumprimento:\n\n- Boa noite, sortudo…\n\n- Sortudo?\n\n- Sim! Vejo que queres companhia. E estou aqui para te ajudar…\n\nAs frases eram invariavelmente as mesmas, proferidas naquele tom meloso de provocação libidinosa. Afastou-se do carro um pouco para que a apreciasse. O condutor não gostou do que viu e sem nada dizer, arrancou.\n\nMais à frente duas jovens tiveram mais sorte e entraram na viatura.\n\nAlcina nem pestanejou. Já sabia que era assim. A sua idade trazia-lhe profundos sulcos na face, que nem as camadas de base conseguiam disfarçar.\n\nTodavia o corpo parecia menos mau, assim julgava. Vestia nessa noite uma minisaia curta que mais parecia um cinto. Um top cotado e meias de renda. Por cima, um casaco comprido de um vermelho berrante mas atractivo.\n\nRegressou ao toldo e sentou-se no degrau frio e molhado. Encostou a cabeça à parede e adormeceu. Nesse sono acabou por viajar ao seu passado, umas vezes fantástico, outras nem tanto. Parecia sentir ainda o cheiro do pão acabado de cozer e outrossim do corpo gordo e mal-cheiroso do velho que a possuíra pela primeira vez. Aquele sono levou-a de regresso à sua antiga escola, onde as letras e os números a animavam. E à mãe que desejava colocar a filha a estudar mas o pai, austero e avaro, só pretendia dinheiro.\n\nSentiu um toque muito ao de leve no ombro. Acordou sobressaltada e deu de caras com um jovem rapaz que a mirava. Perguntou:\n\n- Não achas que és muito novo para andares às meninas?\n\nO jovem voluntário olhou para os colegas ao lado e sorriu. Insistiu:\n\n- Posso ajudá-la nalguma coisa?\n\nAlcina percebendo finalmente o equívoco, respondeu:\n\n- Hum, só gostava de voltar a ser feliz!\n\nTags:400 palavrasescrita\n link do post comentar favorito\ninícioseguinte »\n5 comentários\n Anónimo  08.12.2014\nlink do comentário\nresponder\ndiscussão\nImagem de perfil\n José da Xã  08.12.2014\nObrigado Paulo.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Move over, werewolves and vampires. There’s a big, richly imaginative and extremely spooky world of desi ghosts, monsters and mythical creatures just waiting to devour…er to be discovered and given their rightful place in popular culture. Some of them can be found crawling through the pages of ancient texts, some adorn temple walls, while the stories of others are told through whispers and hushed songs, their forms changing and twisting with each narration. There are thousands of mythical creatures of Indian origin, but in the interest of space, attention span and potential Halloween costumes, we’ve prepared a list of seven fantastic creatures and where to find them (but hopefully you won’t go looking for them).\n\nTekhumiavi\nThe tale of the tekhumiavi or the were-tiger is popular among the Angami tribe of Nagaland. Unlike werewolves, were-tigers don’t transform from human to animal completely. Instead, only the soul of the human shifts to a tiger’s body, while the human body functions normally, albeit soulless for the time being. While in this form, the human behaves just like a tiger, and the human body experiences everything the tiger body does – somewhat like what happens in the Matrix. \n\nNow, how does one tell a tekhumiavi from a regular tiger? Simple – the were-tiger has five claws instead of four, so you can tell from the pugmarks. So, here’s something to look out for when you’re exploring the hills of Nagaland. \n\nTekhumiavi\nPenchapenchi\nThis monster out of Bengali folklore looks like an owl – yes, the dispenser of wisdom in animal stories – but it doesn’t exactly behave like one. A penchapenchi preys on forest dwellers, especially the ones who are foolish to wander off alone. Once the penchapenchi is sure that help is far away, it strikes down its prey and then drains their blood. Whether the victim turns into a penchapenchi (like in the case of a vampire bite) or not is yet to be confirmed.\n\nPenchapenchi\nNavagunjara\nA mash-up of nine different animals, the navagunjara makes a special appearance in an Odia retelling of the Mahabharata as a manifestation of Vishnu. Story goes that when Arjuna, one of the Pandava princes, was in the middle of a penance, a strange creature appeared before him. Arjuna’s instinctive reaction, because he was terrified, was of course to point an arrow at it. The creature had the neck and head of a peacock, the hump of a bull, the waist of a lion, and the tail of a snake, and it stood on three different kinds of feet – an elephant’s, a horse or a deer’s and a tiger’s. Its fourth limb was human, which held a lotus. Before he let the arrow fly, Arjuna saw the lotus and realised what the creature truly represented. \n\nNavagunjara\nNavagunjara\nNaale Ba\nAn urban legend, mostly based in Karnataka, demands that the words Naale ba or ‘come tomorrow’ be painted outside houses (with no spelling mistakes, mind) to ward off a witch, who likes knocking on doors at night and murdering whoever’s unlucky enough to open them. Thankfully, the witch’s kryptonite seems to be her own politeness.\n\nNaale Ba\nNishi\nMonsters really do have a thing for lone travellers, don’t they? The nishi, found mostly in the forests of Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand, are particularly vicious because they call out to their potential victims in the voice of their loved ones. Once the victims are lured into a well and truly secluded place, the nishi proceeds to kill them. Because they always appear in the distance, the only description we have of them is that they are shadowy creatures. Fortunately,  there is a way to identify these crafty creatures. If you hear the call thrice, you can rest assured that it’s not a nishi, because the ghost can, well, only be bothered to call out twice. The next time a loved one fondly calls out to you twice, there is no need to respond; flee.\n\nNishi\nGandeberunda\nYou probably already know the story of Narasimha, Vishnu’s hybrid avatar. Evil demon Hiranyakashipu gets a boon from Brahma that makes him practically invincible, which in turn gives him the licence to terrorize everyone. But when he tries to murder his own son, Vishnu decides that enough is enough and vanquishes Hiranyakashipu in the most creative way (you see, all boons come with loopholes) in his Narasimha avatar.\n\nThe story doesn’t end there though. Even with Hiranyakashipu out of the picture, Narasimha is still really, really angry, and afraid that his anger issues would destroy the world, the gods beseech Shiva to do something. Of course, the only way to tackle a powerful mythical creature is to turn into a powerful mythical creature yourself. Shiva becomes Sharabha – a half-lion (to match Narasimha, understandably) and half-bird form (the OG Angry Bird) – and manages to subdue Narasimha. The story is still not over, because Narasimha becomes Angrier Bird – taking on the form of Gandeberunda, a gigantic two-headed bird with Hulk-like strength. Sharabha, thankfully, calls it quits after 18 days of fighting and Gandeberunda also finally calms down. This powerful bird happens to be the state emblem of Karnataka, and the Gandeberunda motif can be found in many places in India, including temple architecture.\n\nGandeberunda\nDecorative motif on the ceiling of Brihadeeswarar temple\nBhoota Vahana Yantra\nIt appears that robots are quite ancient. According to an 11th-century text, when Buddha died, it fell to King Ajatashatru of Magadha to protect his sacred relics. Ajatashatru concealed the relics in a secret underground chamber in his capital, Pataliputra (now Patna in Bihar). And the warriors who stood guard were automatons, but not just any automatons though. Bhoota Vahana Yantra literally means ‘spirit movement machine’, so these robots had spirits inside them that were responsible for their movements. Needless to say, these robots made excellent guards. \n\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

When your employees feel well and happy at work, they surely work more effectively and also keep telling good things about a company to other people around them, outside of a company. \nRemember that if you take good care of your employees, for example you organize good health care for them, they will have less sick days and on that way absences from work and productivity in your company will be on high level. \nOne good thing to remember is that employees have their private life also. Give your good respect on that too. Talk with your employees and listen to them. Show interest on everything they do. You all are one big family!\nThere are few things that you have to avoid. Don´t ever loose your temper in front of your employees. Don´t blame them unfairly either.\nGive all your encouragements and thanks to employees and you will have success with your business.\nGood luck with everything you do!\nSari ", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 3}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The concept of celebrity itself warrants scrutiny. While fame may stem from genuine talent or accomplishment, the nature of modern celebrity often emphasizes superficial qualities over substance. Celebrities, at times, are placed on pedestals based solely on their curated online personas, rather than on meaningful contributions to society. This can create unrealistic ideals that influence public perception, especially among younger audiences, encouraging materialism and unattainable beauty standards.\nFurthermore, the media’s relentless focus on the private lives of celebrities perpetuates a culture that values voyeurism over genuine engagement. For example, the obsession with their relationships, controversies, or fashion choices often overshadows their artistic or professional endeavors. In this way, the celebrity phenomenon can detract from promoting individuals who achieve remarkable feats in science, education, or social activism.\nThat said, many celebrities use their platform to advocate for important causes, showing that fame can be leveraged for positive change. Yet, the fixation on stardom raises the question: Should society shift its focus from idolizing fame to celebrating the unsung heroes who truly make a difference? The answer may lie in recalibrating our values and finding inspiration in those who influence the world behind the spotlight.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is not only the right thing for companies to do, but it also makes good business sense. While some argue that a company’s main job is to focus only on making profits for its shareholders, this ignores the fact that businesses are part of the wider society. Companies depend on communities for their workforce, resources, and infrastructure, so it’s only fair that they give something back and help improve the places where they operate.\n\nSome people think CSR is just a way for companies to boost their image without making a real impact, but that view overlooks how important CSR can be to a company’s success. As Jack@MSU said, customers today are more likely to support companies that show they care about social and environmental issues. When companies genuinely engage in CSR, they build trust with consumers, which leads to stronger loyalty and, in turn, higher profits. This creates a positive cycle where both the company and society benefit.\n\nOn top of that, companies that focus on sustainability and fair treatment of employees are setting themselves up for long-term success. As Lil@213 pointed out, sustainable operations reduce risk and ensure that a business will continue to thrive in the future. Treating employees well also leads to better productivity and lower turnover, which saves money and boosts performance.\n\nIn summary, CSR isn’t just about giving back to society; it’s also a strategy for building a successful, lasting business. Companies that ignore their social responsibility may profit in the short term, but those that integrate CSR into their core values are more likely to see long-term success while making a positive impact on the world around them.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

It looks at three major areas where big changes are happening — and what the future might look like.\n\nFirst, there’s a shift in how younger generations view car ownership. Many are giving up driving in favor of public transport, preferring to stay connected through their devices and be productive during their commutes. Environmental awareness and cost savings are also major factors influencing this trend.\n\nSecond, the air travel industry is continuing to adapt through cost-cutting, with budget airlines offering cheaper options than ever before. Though comfort may be sacrificed, affordability is making air travel accessible to more people.\n\nLastly, and most excitingly, the article explores the future of space tourism. While it's currently exclusive to the ultra-rich, there's potential for it to become a mass-market phenomenon in the future.\n\nHere’s the link if you want to check it out — it's a quick and thought-provoking read!\n\nBest,", "task_id": "ff0155e4-a137-4a41-a7b2-ebeaf0213c72", "level_title": "Travel Industry", "label": 5}

We see them in big factories helping to build cars, in hospitals assisting doctors, and even in some restaurants serving food. It’s exciting to see how technology is growing so fast. I think robots can be really helpful—they don’t get tired, they don’t make many mistakes, and they can do boring or dangerous jobs that people don’t want to do. But at the same time, I worry about what will happen to people who might lose their jobs because of robots. If machines can do everything, where will humans fit in? I believe robots should work with humans, not replace them. Also, we need to make sure that everyone learns new skills so they can find better jobs in this changing world.

Com o avanço de dispositivos móveis, redes sociais e inteligência artificial, as formas de comunicação, aprendizado e até lazer foram totalmente repaginadas. No entanto, ao mesmo tempo em que essas inovações trazem benefícios incontestáveis, elas também trazem desafios que merecem atenção.\n\nUma das maiores vantagens da tecnologia é a facilidade com que podemos nos conectar com pessoas ao redor do mundo. Redes sociais, aplicativos de mensagem e videoconferências aproximam amigos, familiares e profissionais, independentemente da distância. Além disso, a internet abriu um vasto campo de conhecimento, acessível a qualquer momento, permitindo a educação contínua.\n\nNo entanto, esse uso constante da tecnologia tem suas contrapartidas. O aumento do tempo frente às telas está relacionado ao sedentarismo, distúrbios do sono e até problemas de saúde mental, como a ansiedade. Além disso, a quantidade de informações disponíveis pode ser avassaladora, o que dificulta a seleção do que é realmente relevante e confiável.\n\nPortanto, o grande desafio do século XXI é encontrar um equilíbrio saudável entre aproveitar as inovações tecnológicas e preservar o nosso bem-estar.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language is a rewarding yet challenging experience. Many language learners face common issues that can hinder their progress. One of the most significant challenges is motivation. Consistency is key in language learning, but maintaining interest over time can be difficult, especially when progress seems slow or when faced with the complexities of grammar and pronunciation.\n\nAnother issue is the fear of making mistakes. Many learners hesitate to speak because they fear they will sound incorrect or be misunderstood. This fear can lead to a lack of practice, which, in turn, slows down improvement. Overcoming this fear requires a shift in mindset, focusing on communication rather than perfection.\n\nAdditionally, the learning environment plays a crucial role. Without immersion or constant exposure to the language, learners may struggle to retain vocabulary or develop fluency. This can be particularly challenging for those who do not live in a country where the language is spoken. Language learners must be creative in finding ways to surround themselves with the language, such as through movies, music, or online conversations with native speakers.\n\nLastly, differences in cultural context can be a barrier. Understanding the culture behind a language is essential for full comprehension and communication. Without this understanding, learners might miss out on nuances or idiomatic expressions that are crucial for mastering a language.\n\nBy addressing these challenges, learners can improve their language skills and stay motivated throughout the journey.\n\n\n", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Leadership is about more than just giving instructions, it’s about guiding, supporting, and inspiring others. A good leader communicates clearly, listens actively, and earns the trust of their team. From what I have seen, leadership often begins with small actions, like taking responsibility, helping teammates, or stepping up when things get tough. Over time, these actions build respect and show others that you’re dependable. Confidence is another key quality, but it doesn’t mean being loud or bossy. It’s about believing in yourself and your decisions while staying open to feedback. Patience and the ability to stay calm during stressful situations also help a lot.

Reasons for dissatisfaction included concerns with design, size, color, and material.\n\nConclusions: Collarless dress shirts have limited appeal in Rio, largely due to design and fit issues, while they were moderately well-received in Shanghai. Both regions suggested that the product may benefit from additional market research to meet consumer expectations.\n\nRecommendations: To improve appeal, we suggest additional research on regional preferences, adjusting designs with slimmer fits, adding color options (e.g., strong primary colors, black, white), and using materials with practical qualities like wrinkle resistance and sweat absorption.

Improving lighting, installing air conditioning, properly organizing storage, updating fire extinguishers, and safely storing chemicals will not only reduce risk but also enhance the overall shopping experience.\nBy resolving these issues, you should be able to secure more favorable insurance quotes.

My name is Jens, and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to introduce you to our company. Today, I want to share with you the story of Frisko Shipping, our achievements, and what we expect from you as new members of our team.\n\nLet me start by taking you back to the year 2001. This was the year when our founder, Bill Frisko, turned a life-changing experience into a vision that would shape the future of global shipping. Bill was once bitten by a shark and saved by a passing ship. This incident inspired him to start his own shipping company, and thus, Frisko Shipping was born.\nToday, we are proud to have locations in 20 cities all over the world, employing more than 5,000 dedicated individuals. Last year, we achieved a profit of 5 million dollars and captured 10 percent of the global market. These accomplishments are a testament to our commitment to excellence and innovation in the shipping industry.\n\nNow, let's talk about what we expect from you. As new recruits, we look for motivated and enthusiastic individuals who are ready to contribute to our ongoing success. Your energy and fresh perspectives are invaluable to us.\n\nSpeaking of motivation, let me share a personal story from Bill Frisko himself. As I mentioned earlier, Bill's encounter with a shark and his subsequent rescue by a ship was a pivotal moment in his life. It taught him that inspiration can come from the most unexpected places. This story is a reminder that each of you has the potential to find inspiration and make a significant impact here at Frisko Shipping.\n\nTo wrap up, I encourage you to think about how you can contribute to our company's growth and success. Be proactive, stay curious, and always look for ways to innovate. Let's make Frisko Shipping an even greater place to work and thrive.\nThank you for your attention, and welcome to the team!\nI hope this draft meets your expectations, Bill. Please let me know if there are any adjustments or additional points you'd like to include.\n ", "task_id": "5c89b5ef-f9e4-44c0-bd77-31ed1d856ff0", "level_title": "Presentations", "label": 5}

The recent incident where Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the oscars is also evident of entitlement of celebrities. I heard someone say very good line on it.

[SEP] Response: NTASIA – Background Information for Deploying Units\n\nThe situation in the Federation of Pantasia began to cause the international community concern a year ago when an election resulted in a vote to break up the federation and form two separate countries for its two main ethnic groups, the Alphas and the Betas. Fighting broke out for control of the mineral-rich Argos Region, as well as between certain minority groups who were made refugees. There is also evidence of an attempt at ethnic cleansing of a minority group.\n\nSix months ago the military staged a coup to reunite the Federation. Although a large portion of the armed forces have returned to Federal control, elements have remained loyal to the new governments of Alpha and Beta. These armies have had small battles between themselves over disputed territories while resisting operations by the Federal forces based in Federal Territory.\n\nUntil a month ago the situation was a stalemate, however, the various factions have been rearming under the pretence of negotiations. Recently, strong leadership in Beta has resulted in a campaign that has pinned down Federal forces and Beta forces have also launched an all-out attack through Alpha territory to seize valuable land in Argos.\n\nThis has resulted in considerable civilian casualties, refugees and dislocation of population. There are reports of executions, rape, destruction of property and infrastructure.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Criticism towards a celebrity often focuses on their personal behavior, public statements, artistic choices, or perceived lack of authenticity, with common criticisms including: unprofessional conduct, hypocrisy, offensive remarks, poor decision-making, excessive self-promotion, unrealistic portrayals, and a disconnect from real-life issues; however, the nature of criticism can vary depending on the celebrity and the context of the situation. \nKey aspects of celebrity criticism:\nPersonal life:\nCritics may scrutinize a celebrity's relationships, substance abuse issues, legal troubles, or family dynamics, sometimes considering their private life as a reflection of their character. \nPublic image:\nA celebrity's persona, particularly if perceived as carefully curated or inauthentic, can be a target for criticism, with accusations of being \"too perfect\" or not being true to themselves. \nSocial and political stances:\nWhen celebrities express strong opinions on social or political issues, they can face backlash from those who disagree with their views, especially if seen as opportunistic or uninformed. \nArtistic performance:\nActors, musicians, and other performers can be criticized for their acting skills, musical quality, or creative choices, with critiques focusing on technical aspects or the overall artistic direction. \nImpact on society:\nSome criticism focuses on the potential negative influence a celebrity might have on their fans, particularly regarding body image, consumerism, or unhealthy behaviors. \nExamples of celebrity criticism:\n\"Cancel culture\":\nA recent trend where celebrities face intense public backlash and potential career consequences for past actions or statements considered offensive or harmful. \n\"Unrealistic portrayals\":\nActors might be criticized for perpetuating unrealistic beauty standards or lifestyle expectations through their roles. \n\"Hypocrisy\":\nWhen a celebrity promotes a certain lifestyle or ethical values while engaging in behavior that contradicts those values. \nImportant considerations:\nPrivacy concerns:\nWhile celebrities often put themselves in the public eye, there are limits to what aspects of their personal life should be subject to criticism. \nConstructive criticism:\nCriticism can be valuable when it focuses on specific areas of improvement or raises important issues, rather than simply being personal attacks. \nMedia bias:\nThe way the media portrays a celebrity can influence public perception and sometimes lead to unfair or exaggerated criticism.

Hesitant but curious, he stepped inside and found himself in a small, dimly lit room. It was a secret concert! A local indie band was performing for a small crowd of about twenty people, seated on chairs and couches. The atmosphere was electric, and the music had a raw, unfiltered energy.\n\nAndy quickly found a spot and was completely absorbed by the performance. When the show ended, he even had a chance to thank the band and chat briefly.

[SEP] Response: \nThis study assessed the anticipated impact of the Sun Valley Dam construction on local sloth species, utilizing an advanced PC simulation to analyze how dam construction and completion will relate to overall sloth livelihood. Simulations were repeatedly run to determine the effect of variables such as habitat area and food variety. Findings indicated that loss of habitat and reduction of food variety will be the primary factors caused by the dam's construction, leading to population decline. It is concluded that these two factors will most significantly impact the sloth population. The recommendation is to relocate local sloth species to the neighboring Corona Valley prior to dam construction to prevent ecological cataclysm and potential extinction.

The rumors about our share prices going down and potentially affecting your investments are completely unfounded. While it is true that our share value experienced a temporary drop two months ago, this was primarily due to the resignation of our former CEO, Greg Johnson. However, we are pleased to report that under the leadership of our new CEO, Harry Levi—who is well-known and highly respected in the industry—our share value has not only recovered but has also reached a historic high.\n\nOur commitment to stability and growth is further reinforced by the recent securing of three major contracts, which guarantee profits over the next three years. This strategic positioning ensures that we remain a strong and stable entity in an otherwise volatile market.\n\nWe deeply appreciate your loyalty and confidence in Future Foundations Construction Company. Your trust is invaluable to us, and we are committed to delivering on our promises. We are excited about the bright future ahead and are eager to share our five-year road map with you soon, which will provide further reassurance of our plans and objectives.\n\nThank you for your continued support.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One legendary creature from Indian mythology that has fascinated people for centuries is the Nāga. Nāgas are serpent-like beings, often depicted as half-human and half-cobra, and they hold a significant place in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions.\n\nIn Hindu mythology, Nāgas are considered powerful and wise, living in the mystical underground realm of Pātāla. They are guardians of treasures and sacred rivers, and some are even associated with rain and fertility. The most famous Nāga is Shesha, the cosmic serpent who serves as the bed for Lord Vishnu and is said to hold the universe on his many hoods.\n\nNāgas can be both benevolent and vengeful. If respected, they bring prosperity and protection. But if angered—especially by the destruction of their habitats—they can bring misfortune. This dual nature makes them both revered and feared.\n\nIn many parts of India, especially in the south, people still worship Nagas at serpent shrines, offering milk and flowers to seek blessings or protection. Their presence in folklore, art, and temple architecture continues to inspire awe and curiosity.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

You've been asked by your editor to write a report on the performance of the Hang Seng (HSI) stock market index. You have some notes and a graph as your guide. Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: Hang Seng Index Shows Strong Growth Driven by Mainland China Investment\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI) has demonstrated robust performance over the past six months, according to recent data. The index has experienced a steady upward trend, primarily fueled by significant investment inflows from Mainland China.\n\nAs depicted in the accompanying graph, the HSI started the period at approximately 22,000 points. While experiencing some volatility with a notable peak and subsequent correction, the overall trajectory has been positive. The index has steadily climbed, reaching close to the 30,000-point mark by the end of the observed period.\n\nThis growth is particularly pronounced in the Properties and Utilities sub-indices. These sectors have witnessed a dramatic rise, largely attributable to the continued economic growth and investment emanating from Mainland China. The strong performance in these key sectors has been a significant contributor to the overall strength of the Hang Seng Index.\n\nMarket analysts suggest that this trend is likely to continue in the short to medium term, contingent on the sustained economic activity and investment flows from the mainland. However, investors should remain mindful of potential global economic headwinds and regulatory changes that could influence market sentiment. Overall, the Hang Seng Index presents a picture of strong growth driven by its close economic ties with Mainland China.", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "level_title": "Banking and Finance", "label": 5}

Additionally, Skills Pro has plans to expand their course offerings, which will provide even greater value to our employees in the future.\nGiven the importance of high-quality training and the long-term benefits of a skilled workforce, we recommend selecting Skills Pro as our training provider.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Applying for a loan in Switzerland is quiet difficult process. You need to provide a lot of documents. Moreover, you need to fill out a lot of forms. When you apply for a loan, Swiss lenders check your credit score from at least one Swiss credit bureau. Credit bureaus are required to give you a credit report upon request. Check whether your credit report has any negative entries, or if your credit scores are poor. Check your debt collection register statement. Many Swiss lenders require you to submit a recent debt collection register statement along with your loan application. You can get this statement from your regional debt collection office, for a fee. Many debt collection offices let you apply for statements using the online Easygov service.\n\nIf you have changed municipalities in the past two years, you have to get a statement from your former debt collection office as well. Lenders generally require you to submit statements that are not more than three months old.\n\nDo not apply for a loan if your debt collection statement has a negative entry. You can find more information in the guide to debt collection in Switzerland.\nPrepare salary statements for the last three months\n\nSwiss lenders normally require you to submit salary slips for the last three months along with your loan application. If you do not receive salary slips, or have not kept them, you will need to get these from your employer.\n\nSwiss lenders will only give you a loan if you have a steady income. Some lenders will contact your employer to inquire about your salary if your salary statements show any irregularities. Ideally, you should wait on applying for a loan until you have received the same steady salary for at least three months.\n\n5. Prepare the necessary documents\n\nThese documents may be required by lenders:\n\nSalary statements for the past three months.\nA current statement from the debt collection register.\nA current ZEK statement.\nA certified copy of your passport or ID, or your Swiss residence permit. You can make a certified copy at the counters of SBB/CFF train station offices that offer money-changing services for 18 francs. Swiss post offices offer this service for 25 francs. Make sure to account for these costs when calculating the total cost of your loan. If you have the option of using online identification or applying for the loan in a branch office, then submitting a certified copy of your identification document is not necessary.\nThe rental contract for your home (and/or mortgage agreements, if you own property).\nLeasing agreements.\nInsurance policies.\nBreakdown of alimony payments.\nRuling on separation from a partner.\nRuling on divorce from a partner.\nCurrent credit card statements.\nLoan statements for existing loans.\nContracts with educational institutions (school fees for dependent children, for example).\nAdditional documents that verify any other ongoing payment obligations.\nDepending on the lender and your situation, you may not need to submit all of these documents. But preparing as many of the relevant documents in advance will help you avoid stress during the loan application process.\n", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 4}

The pace of life is slower, encouraging mindfulness and appreciation of small details—like the sound of bamboo rustling or the sight of cherry blossoms falling.\n\nThen there’s New York City, a place that pulses with energy and ambition. Skyscrapers tower over bustling streets, and every corner offers something new—street performers, food trucks, or spontaneous conversations. Unlike Kyoto’s quiet charm, New York thrives on movement and diversity. It’s a city where people chase dreams and where cultures collide in vibrant harmony.\n\nWhile Kyoto offers peace and tradition, New York offers excitement and innovation.

[SEP] Response: Hi Pete,\n\nThank you for speaking with me during our recent consultation. Based on our conversation, I’ve noted several lifestyle habits that may be affecting your health and well-being.\n\nWorking long hours and sitting at your desk all day is causing physical strain—particularly back pain—which is likely worsened by a poor-quality chair. This sedentary routine, combined with smoking, high coffee intake, and lack of sleep, is contributing to your constant fatigue and stress. Additionally, your reliance on junk food and lack of physical activity is having a negative impact on your weight and overall energy levels.\n\nTo start making changes, I recommend replacing one coffee per day with a glass of water, taking regular breaks from your desk, and considering light daily exercise such as walking or stretching. Improving your diet by including more fresh fruits and vegetables will boost your energy and mood. Lastly, cutting down on screen time before bed can greatly improve your sleep quality.\n\nSmall adjustments will lead to big improvements over time. Reducing stress, eating better, and staying active will help you feel more energized, focused, and in control of your health.\n\nLet me know if you'd like help setting goals.\n\nBest regards,\nPedro\nLife Coach", "task_id": "ea118437-9196-46db-8e48-834541d37cba", "level_title": "Society and Leisure", "label": 5}

Persuade your design team to choose one of the designs for next year’s rollout. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: The image presents two distinct versions of the \"Geothermal Fluxcapacitor XZ3\" vehicle, showcasing a clear differentiation in performance and likely, target audience. The top vehicle, a fiery red with a subtle orange accent, boasts a powerful 6.4-liter all-aluminum V8 engine, paired with a five-speed Presto transmission. This combination propels the car from 0 to 60 mph in a mere 2.7 seconds, achieving a top speed of 207.1 mph. Its 107.1-inch wheelbase, Gloonow traction, and superior aerodynamics suggest a focus on high-performance handling and stability. The explicit mention of \"gasoline powered\" underscores its traditional combustion engine.\nIn contrast, the lower vehicle, a vibrant lime green, is the \"Fluxcapacitor E-XZ3\" variant. It features a 5.4-liter all-aluminum V8 engine and a five-speed Presto-E transmission. While still a V8, its performance is notably different, reaching 60 mph in 5.7 seconds with a top speed of 159.1 mph. The slightly shorter 106.9-inch wheelbase may indicate subtle handling differences. The absence of the \"gasoline powered\" label suggests a potential hybrid or electric powertrain, aligning with the \"E-\" designation.\nBoth vehicles share a similar aesthetic, reminiscent of a Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano, with sleek lines and a low profile. However, their performance specifications clearly cater to different driving experiences and potentially, different environmental considerations. The red model is geared towards the thrill-seeking driver, while the green model likely offers a more balanced blend of performance and efficiency. The image effectively highlights these distinctions, prompting the viewer to consider their priorities when choosing between these two variations.", "task_id": "64058d7e-9b06-4ed8-9b01-5b7efb9fb3ef", "level_title": "Automotive", "label": 5}

To help you prepare, listen again to the Inspector talking about ways to combat counterfeiting. What does he say companies can do to fight counterfeiting? What can the public do? [SEP] Response: Combating Counterfeit Goods\n\nTo effectively combat counterfeiting, the Inspector highlights several actions both companies and the public can take. Companies should invest in secure packaging, unique labeling, and traceable serial numbers to make it harder for counterfeiters to replicate products. They are also encouraged to work closely with customs and law enforcement agencies, sharing information and taking legal action when necessary. Regular training for staff and awareness campaigns can also help detect and prevent counterfeiting.\n\nThe public also plays a vital role. Consumers are urged to buy from reputable retailers and to be cautious of deals that seem too good to be true. Checking labels, packaging quality, and seller reviews can help identify fake goods. The Inspector encourages people to report any suspected counterfeit items to the authorities, as this helps investigations and supports broader efforts to shut down illegal operations. Together, informed companies and vigilant consumers can make a significant difference. ", "task_id": "40c5296c-1566-40a3-b597-d2e8c4ac36bc", "level_title": "Police and Immigration", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.", "task_id": "10c9bef1-d410-4e08-a1f9-51f7dbfe0aac", "level_title": "Law", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language students often face a variety of challenges that can hinder their progress. One major issue is the lack of immersion in the target language. Without regular exposure to native speakers and real-life contexts, students may struggle to develop fluency and proper pronunciation. Additionally, the fear of making mistakes can be a significant barrier. Many students feel self-conscious about speaking in a new language, which can limit their practice opportunities and slow their learning.\n\nAnother common challenge is the complexity of grammar rules and vocabulary. Learning a new language often involves memorizing extensive lists of words and understanding intricate grammatical structures, which can be overwhelming. Time management is also a critical issue, as balancing language study with other responsibilities can be difficult.\n\nTo address these challenges, students can seek out language exchange partners, use language learning apps, and immerse themselves in media such as movies, music, and books in the target language. It's also important to create a supportive learning environment where mistakes are seen as a natural part of the learning process. By staying motivated and using a variety of resources, language students can overcome these obstacles and achieve their language learning goals.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write the email in a friendly but fairly formal style. Type in the input box. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger system that securely records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures the data is tamper-proof and transparent. Originally developed as the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, blockchain has since found applications in many other industries, including finance, healthcare, supply chain, and voting systems.\n\nThe core of blockchain technology is its ability to store data in “blocks” that are linked together in a chronological chain. Each block contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block, ensuring that once data is added, it cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks, which would require the consensus of the network. This makes it highly secure and resistant to fraud.\n\nOne of the main benefits of blockchain is decentralization. Unlike traditional centralized systems where a single entity has control, blockchain operates on a network of computers (or nodes) that work together to validate and store data, removing the need for intermediaries. This can lower costs and increase efficiency.\n\nWhile blockchain holds great promise, challenges remain, such as scalability and energy consumption. However, ongoing advancements continue to address these issues, making blockchain a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize many sectors.", "task_id": "2d726061-d067-49a6-a950-5c33482ce17f", "level_title": "14-Advanced", "label": 0}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become a fundamental aspect of modern business practices, reflecting an organization’s commitment to ethical behavior, sustainable development, and the well-being of society. As businesses continue to recognize their influential role in the global landscape, CSR initiatives have emerged as a vital component for fostering trust and building a positive brand image.\n\nOne of the key arguments in favor of CSR is its potential to create shared value for both businesses and communities. By integrating social and environmental considerations into their operations, companies can drive innovation, reduce costs, and open new market opportunities. For instance, sustainable practices such as energy efficiency and waste reduction not only benefit the environment but also result in significant cost savings for businesses.\n\nMoreover, CSR initiatives can enhance a company's reputation and strengthen its relationship with stakeholders, including customers, employees, and investors. Consumers today are increasingly inclined to support brands that align with their values, and a strong CSR strategy can serve as a powerful differentiator in a competitive market. Similarly, employees are more likely to feel motivated and loyal when they work for a company that demonstrates a genuine commitment to social and environmental issues.\n\nHowever, it is crucial for companies to approach CSR authentically, avoiding superficial or insincere efforts commonly referred to as \"greenwashing.\" Transparency and accountability should be at the forefront of any CSR strategy to ensure that businesses truly contribute to societal progress.\n\nIn conclusion, corporate social responsibility is not merely a philanthropic endeavor but a strategic approach that can drive sustainable business success while contributing positively to society. By embracing CSR, companies can play a pivotal role in addressing global challenges while securing their long-term growth and relevance.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16-Upper Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: A home loan is a financial instrument that assists individuals in achieving the dream of homeownership. It provides necessary capital to purchase property while allowing borrowers to repay the loan over an extended period. Home loans typically offer competitive interest rates and flexible repayment options, making them accessible to a diverse range of buyers. Because these loans are secured by the property itself, lenders are afforded a level of protection, while borrowers gain the opportunity to invest in their future.\n\nMoreover, home loans promote responsible financial planning by encouraging regular savings and disciplined budgeting. Borrowers who commit to monthly payments often experience improved credit scores, which can open doors to additional financial opportunities. Navigating the process of obtaining a home loan may seem complex due to paperwork, eligibility criteria, and market fluctuations; however, thorough research and expert guidance can ease the process.\n\nUltimately, a home loan is not merely a means to purchase a house but also a stepping stone towards long-term financial stability. It empowers families to establish roots in a community, build equity, and secure a foundation for future wealth. Embracing a home loan responsibly can transform the dream of owning a home into a rewarding reality indeed.

[SEP] Response: Both designs offer distinct features and performance metrics that cater to different market needs and preferences. Below is a detailed comparison of the two models based on key specifications and features. While both car designs have their merits, I strongly recommend going with the Xz3 model for next year’s rollout for the following reasons: The Xz3’s higher acceleration and top speed make it a standout performer, catering to enthusiasts and those seeking high-performance vehicles. Consumers often prioritize speed and power in high-end car markets. The Xz3’s specifications align with these demands, likely resulting in higher sales and greater market penetration. While hydrogen power is the future, gasoline remains the more practical and readily available option in the current market. This ensures that consumers have easy access to fuel, enhancing the car’s usability and convenience.Rolling out a high-performance model like the Xz3 can bolster our brand image, positioning us as leaders in automotive innovation and performance. The Xz3’s combination of superior engine power, exceptional performance metrics, and market-ready fuel source makes it the optimal choice for next year’s rollout.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 14-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Using your notes, draft a speech with a consistent metaphor. Add variety by using different terms for teams and problems. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most common mistakes in making presentations is making them too wordy, too information dense, and too complicated. Brevity and simplicity are allies in making an engaging presentation that keeps the audience’s attention. An analysis of presentations in the financial sector by Barron’s found that shorter presentations outperform longer ones: “Poor performing investment presentations were 12 pages longer than ones that performed well.”\n\nMoreover, each individual slide should be simple and straightforward. PowerPoint designer Nancy Duarte suggests that presenters follow a 3-second rule. Specifically, the audience should be able to understand the main point of a slide within 3 seconds. Why does this matter? Psychology. According to the Redundancy Effect, audiences that have to process the same information from multiple sources, like a visual PowerPoint slide plus what the presenter is saying, have a reduced ability to process and retain that information. Instead of making a presentation of decontextualized facts and figures, weave the content of your presentation into a narrative. More than half of people say that a great story is the main thing that keeps their attention during presentations, according to Prezi.\n ", "task_id": "51184f66-e317-457a-bda9-d73a241b7871", "level_title": "14-Advanced", "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: Military [SEP] Prompt: You are preparing to brief your troops about the unit’s deployment. Read the information again and make notes on the main points. Type into the input box. Compare your notes with the model text at the end. [SEP] Response: The Federation of Pantasia has been experiencing a severe and complex conflict that has attracted international attention. The tensions began about a year ago when an election led to a controversial vote that divided the federation into two separate countries, each representing one of the two main ethnic groups in the region: the Alphas and the Betas. This decision caused widespread unrest, as both groups sought to assert control over valuable territories, particularly the mineral-rich Argos region. The split also had a devastating impact on minority groups, many of whom were displaced and became refugees due to the ensuing violence.\n\nThe situation escalated further six months ago when the military intervened with a coup aimed at reuniting the Federation under a single government. Although a large portion of the military returned to Federal control, some units remained loyal to the newly established Alpha and Beta governments. These factions have engaged in skirmishes over contested territories, resisting the Federal forces stationed in what is now referred to as Federal Territory.\n\nIn recent months, the conflict reached a critical point as leaders from the Beta faction strengthened their position and launched an aggressive campaign. This offensive successfully pinned down Federal forces, and Beta’s army expanded its assault by moving through Alpha-held territories in an attempt to seize strategically valuable lands in the Argos region.\n\nThe ongoing violence has had a devastating impact on civilians. Reports indicate a significant increase in casualties, widespread displacement, and significant property damage. Many residents have been forced to abandon their homes, and there are alarming reports of atrocities, including executions, sexual violence, and destruction of infrastructure. Additionally, there are concerns that Beta has established concentration camps as part of a broader ethnic cleansing policy, which has intensified fears and brought calls for international intervention.\n\nThe situation in Pantasia remains fragile and volatile, with the potential for further escalation unless a peaceful resolution can be negotiated. The international community continues to monitor the crisis, recognizing the urgent need for diplomatic solutions to prevent additional suffering and restore stability in the region    ", "task_id": "cffee9ec-0e17-4031-aeca-2723113def03", "level_title": "Military", "label": 5}

That way, you can spend less time gathering data and more time doing the work that matters.\n\nWhether you’re preparing to create your first project status report or looking for a better system, this article will tell you what a progress report is, how to create one, and how to use project status reports to always meet your deadlines.", "task_id": "1dc879f7-2765-4ba4-90f6-522fa596e03c", "level_title": "Military", "label": 0}

We bought a little two-bedroom house in the suburbs, and we're basically happy, but sometimes we feel that something's missing. The suburbs are crowded, and the houses all look the same.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: In the ongoing discussion about the role of companies, I firmly believe that their responsibilities extend significantly beyond just generating profits for shareholders. While financial success is necessary for survival, a company's influence on society and the environment is undeniable, and this creates broader obligations.\n\nOperating within communities means companies interact with local residents, use public infrastructure, and depend on the local workforce. Therefore, they have a duty to be good neighbours and contribute positively. This includes adopting sustainable practices to protect the environment for future generations, ensuring safe and fair working conditions for employees, and perhaps supporting local education or health initiatives. As suggested by one of the submissions, this relationship is indeed a \"two-way street,\" where mutual benefit is key. Ignoring societal well-being for profit alone is a short-sighted approach.\n\nFurthermore, strong Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is increasingly vital for long-term business success. Customers, employees, and investors are more aware of ethical and environmental issues and tend to favour companies that demonstrate genuine care. A strong CSR record can enhance a company's reputation, build trust, and foster customer loyalty. It can also attract and retain talented employees who are proud to work for a responsible organisation. Ultimately, integrating social responsibility into business strategy isn't just ethical; it also makes excellent business sense and contributes to sustainable growth.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: While celebrity culture is often praised for providing entertainment and inspiration, it’s important to critically examine its more troubling aspects. One major concern is the way celebrities are frequently celebrated for superficial qualities rather than meaningful achievements. It could be argued that society places far too much importance on appearances and wealth, rather than character or genuine talent. In some cases, it seems that fame is rewarded simply for being famous, rather than for contributing anything of lasting value.\n\nMoreover, many celebrities tend to set unrealistic standards for ordinary people, particularly in terms of beauty and lifestyle. This often leads to unhealthy comparisons, especially among young audiences. It’s also worth pointing out that celebrity scandals are sometimes excused or even glorified, which sends a problematic message about accountability.\n\nTo be fair, not all celebrities fall into this pattern—some use their platforms responsibly and advocate for important causes. However, the overall culture surrounding fame can be deeply flawed and deserves more critical attention.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

The beach is not just a destination; it's a sanctuary where I find solace and rejuvenation. Two main aspects make this place my favorite: its natural beauty and the profound sense of peace it brings.\n\nAspect X: The Natural Beauty\nThe beach is a canvas painted with the most vibrant colors of nature. The golden sand stretches endlessly, meeting the azure waves that dance rhythmically to the shore. The sound of the waves crashing gently against the rocks is like a soothing melody, calming my mind and soul. The sight of the sun setting over the horizon, casting a warm, golden glow over the water, is a spectacle that never fails to captivate me. The natural beauty of the beach, with its serene landscapes and harmonious sounds, is a major reason why it holds a special place in my heart.\n\nAspect Y: The Sense of Peace\nBeyond its physical beauty, the beach offers an unparalleled sense of peace. Walking along the shore, feeling the cool breeze against my skin, and listening to the gentle lull of the waves, I find a deep sense of tranquility. Whether I'm reading a book under the shade of a palm tree, collecting seashells, or simply sitting and watching the waves, the beach provides a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. This sense of peace and relaxation is essential for my well-being, making the beach my ultimate retreat.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the beach is my favorite place because of its stunning natural beauty and the profound sense of peace it offers. It is a place where I can connect with nature, find inner calm, and recharge my spirit. The beach is not just a location; it is a haven that holds a special place in my heart and life.\n", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

To do this, an advanced PC simulation was created, and the simulation was run repeatedly to determine the effect of each variable independently. According to the repeated simulations, loss of habitat and reduction of food variety will be the two factors caused by the construction of the dam that will relate most to a decline in local sloth populations. To prevent ecological cataclysm and perhaps even extinction, it is recommended that local sloth species be relocated to neighboring Corona Valley.", "task_id": "76bba4e9-a91a-49e2-89a6-129b5a013873", "level_title": "Sciences", "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: Sciences [SEP] Prompt: Write a description, introducing the new bird species, comparing its appearance and habitat to that of the American robin, and classification using the formal zoological classification system. For the classification, suggest a name for the new species and say why it’s suitable. Use the email as reference. [SEP] Response: **New Bird Species Description:**\n\nA newly identified bird species has been discovered through DNA testing of several flocks previously believed to be American robins (*Turdus migratorius*). This discovery, led by Dr. Yamada, reveals a distinct yet closely related species within the *Turdus* genus.\n\n**Appearance:**\nThe new species bears a strong resemblance to the American robin but exhibits several key differences. It is slightly smaller in size and has a notably larger bill. The male’s plumage features a rustier hue on the chest rather than the bright red seen in the American robin, giving it a more muted, earthy appearance.\n\n**Habitat:**\nBoth species inhabit similar terrains, such as open woodlands and suburban areas. However, unlike the American robin, which migrates to the southern United States and Central America during the winter, the newly discovered species remains year-round in Canada. This non-migratory behavior is a distinctive ecological trait.\n\n**Zoological Classification:**\n\n* **Kingdom:** Animalia\n* **Phylum:** Chordata\n* **Class:** Aves\n* **Order:** Passeriformes\n* **Family:** Turdidae\n* **Genus:** *Turdus*\n* **Species:** *Turdus borealis* (proposed)\n\n**Species Name Justification:**\nThe proposed species name, *Turdus borealis*, reflects the bird’s northern (boreal) range, especially its year-round presence in Canada. This name highlights a key ecological and behavioral distinction from its close relative, the American robin, and aligns with zoological naming conventions that emphasize geographic or characteristic differences.\n\nThis discovery enriches our understanding of avian diversity in North America and underscores the importance of genetic analysis in modern taxonomy.\n", "task_id": "fd6132f4-a3e2-4a63-b2d3-2336f120b95a", "level_title": "Sciences", "label": 5}

Можна милуватися і захоплюватися звичайними речами: сходом сонця, квіточкою кульбабки, посмішкою сусіда чи навіть незвичайною формою камінчика на дорозі. Можна отримувати від усього цього позитивні враження і дарувати їх іншим. Мабуть, на підсвідомому рівні, кожна людина прагне до прекрасного. Відомі непоодинокі випадки, коли витвори мистецтва були здатні змінити долю, а прекрасні природні ландшафти – заспокоювали у хвилини розпуки та надихали до життя. Малечі з дитинства прищеплюють любов до прекрасного, адже це запорука розвитку естетичних смаків, це шлях до добра і гарних вчинків. Людина, що захоплюється красою навколишнього світу не може бути злою, вона націлена та творчість а не на руйнування. Люди намагаються оточити себе прекрасними предметами у побуті, обирають найгарніші речі, щоб прикрасити себе, звертають увагу на те, що милує око, і все це – заради краси. Нажаль, не всі розуміють, що краса буває різною. Зовнішні прояви краси не здатні вплинути на покращення життя у світі, найцінніша – внутрішня краса. Найкрасивіша та людина, у якої гарна душа. Такі люди наділені найкращими якостями, які привертають до себе увагу: вмінням співпереживати, добротою, щирістю, відданістю. Такі люди здатні подарувати оточуючим відчуття насолоди красою, бо саме такі прояви цієї якості і здатні врятувати всесвіт. Треба старатися бути красивим душею, мати потяг до досконалості. Це стремління повинне бути постійним, а не тимчасовим, для того, щоб по вихвалятися своїми гарними якостями. Якщо кожна людина, намагатиметься додати до життя, хоч крапельку прекрасного, світ зміниться на краще. Щезнуть горе, війни та злидні.

When I was younger, the most important sources of information were print newspapers and evening news: they were trusted, routine, and scheduled. Today, I rely heavily on digital media, especially social media platforms, news apps, and podcasts. This change has altered how I consume information; instead of sitting down to read a full newspaper, I scroll through headlines, skim articles, and rely on curated content. While this allows for quicker access to information, it also comes with drawbacks - mainly, the risk of misinformation and the tendency to stay within echo chambers. My reading habits have become more fragmented: I read more frequently, but in shorted bursts, and rarely finish long articles unless they are particularly compelling. Overall, media has become more immediate and accessible; however, it requires more effort to find reliable sources and to stay truly informed.

What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Developing leadership qualities is a process that requires self-awareness, patience, and continuous learning. Based on personal experience and observations of others, I believe that effective leadership starts with empathy and communication. Being able to listen to others and understand their perspectives is key to building trust within a team. Leadership isn’t about dominating conversations or making all the decisions; it's about empowering others to contribute their ideas and talents.\n\nAnother important quality is adaptability. Leaders must be able to navigate change and remain calm under pressure. A good leader is not afraid to make difficult decisions but does so with the best interests of the team in mind. I’ve seen leaders grow by seeking feedback and being open to constructive criticism, which helped them become more effective.\n\nI believe everyone has the potential to be a leader in their own way. Leadership isn’t restricted to titles or positions—it’s about influence and the ability to inspire others toward a common goal. With the right mindset and effort, anyone can cultivate leadership qualities over time.\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "ce3f3898-f2a7-4978-8f4f-17596f229f1d", "level_title": "12-Upper Intermediate", "label": 5}

However, each model has its own strengths that set them apart.\nElectric 3.0\n* Interior & Comfort: Slightly more spacious and comes with high-end, expensive leather.\n* Performance: Accelerates from 0-100 km/h slightly faster than its competitor.\n* Luxury: Offers a better in-car fragrance and superior comfort.\n* Price: More expensive compared to the X 411.\nX 411\n* Engine & Power: Features a more powerful engine, making it the most powerful car in its category.\n* Performance: Considered top-of-the-line in terms of raw power and driving dynamics.\n* Luxury: While both cars are luxurious, it is hard to determine which one is superior in this aspect.\nCommon Features\n* Safety: Both models come equipped with airbags and advanced safety features.\n* Space: Both vehicles are roomy and comfortable for passengers.\n* Traction: Designed for stability and smooth driving.\nIn conclusion, choosing between the Electric 3.0 and the X 411 depends on personal preference. If you value acceleration, comfort, and refined luxury, the Electric 3.0 is the better choice.

{"text": "Prompt Level: Police and Immigration [SEP] Prompt: Now prepare the content for an informative web page about counterfeit goods. Be sure to keep the following points in mind: Types of counterfeit goods, the effect of counterfeiting on society, the signs of a fake, what to do if you discover fake goods.  Write 250-300 words. [SEP] Response: Understanding Counterfeit Goods: Types, Effects, and How to Spot Them\n\nCounterfeit goods are fake products made to look like genuine items. They come in many forms, including counterfeit clothing, accessories, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and even documents. These fake goods are often sold at lower prices, tempting unsuspecting consumers, but they pose serious risks beyond just financial loss.\n\nTypes of Counterfeit Goods\nCounterfeiting affects a wide range of products. Fashion items like designer clothes, handbags, and watches are commonly counterfeited. Electronics such as smartphones and chargers can be dangerous when made with inferior parts. Pharmaceuticals are especially concerning because fake medicines may lack the proper ingredients, putting lives at risk. Even official documents like passports and driver’s licenses can be forged, causing security concerns.\n\nEffects of Counterfeiting on Society\nThe impact of counterfeit goods goes far beyond tricking buyers. Economically, counterfeiting leads to billions of dollars in lost revenue for legitimate businesses and governments through unpaid taxes. It also contributes to job losses and stifles innovation. On a societal level, counterfeit products can threaten consumer safety, damage brand reputations, and fund organized crime networks.\n\nHow to Spot a Fake\nSpotting counterfeit goods requires careful attention. Look for poor-quality materials, uneven stitching, misspelled logos, or packaging errors. Genuine products often have security features such as holograms, watermarks, or serial numbers. If something feels off—whether it’s the weight, texture, or design—trust your instincts.\n\nWhat to Do if You Discover Fake Goods\nIf you suspect a product is counterfeit, avoid purchasing or using it. Report your findings to local authorities or consumer protection agencies. If it’s an official document, notify relevant government offices. By staying vigilant and informed, you help protect yourself and the wider community from the harms of counterfeit goods.\n", "task_id": "788dc6fa-5111-4a7c-b2c1-a9ddebd0b1a2", "level_title": "Police and Immigration", "label": 5}

Então, o filho arranja uma tigela de madeira e ordena ao pai que passe a comer sentado na soleira da porta, ao que a nora e o neto aceitam sem questionar. No entanto, o neto, ao presenciar aquele tratamento, decide construir uma tigela de madeira para oferecer ao seu progenitor quando for velhinho. Ao tomar conhecimento da intenção do filho, o pai arrepende-se amargamente do que havia feito ao idoso, pedindo-lhe perdão e levando-o novamente para a mesa para lhe dar de comer na boca.\n\nDa situação exposta, retiramos uma moral, a partir do provérbio popular, “não faças aos outros aquilo que não queres que te façam a ti”.

You will end up paying a certain amount as EMI on a monthly basis if you are taking a loan which can be closer to what you pay as rent but eventually over the years it will be under your name.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a landmark trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, implemented on January 1, 1994. NAFTA aimed to eliminate trade barriers and tariffs, fostering a trilateral trade bloc in North America. As one of the largest free trade zones in the world, it sought to increase economic integration and cross-border trade among the member countries.\n\nNAFTA significantly impacted the economies of the three nations. It facilitated the flow of goods and services, allowing for the reduction of costs associated with import and export processes. This resulted in expanded markets for businesses and consumers, leading to increased competitiveness and economic growth. However, it also faced criticism for contributing to job losses in certain sectors, particularly in manufacturing, as companies relocated production to countries with lower labor costs.\n\nIn 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which built upon its predecessor's framework while addressing contemporary issues such as digital trade, labor rights, and environmental protections. Despite its controversial aspects, NAFTA played a crucial role in shaping economic relationships and trade policies in North America for over two decades.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}
