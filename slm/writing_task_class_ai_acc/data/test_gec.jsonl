{"text": "Prompt Level: 7.0 [SEP] Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane has many important parts that help it fly safely and efficiently. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane. It holds the passengers, cargo, and the cockpit where the pilots sit. The fuselage is strong and shaped to reduce air resistance.\nThe wings are attached to the fuselage and are very important for flying. They create lift, which helps the airplane rise into the air. Wings also have flaps and ailerons that help the pilot control the plane’s movement during takeoff, flight, and landing.\nThe tail of the airplane includes the vertical and horizontal stabilizers. These parts keep the airplane stable and help control its direction. The vertical stabilizer helps the airplane turn left or right, while the horizontal stabilizer controls the up and down movement.\nFinally, the engines provide the power needed for the airplane to move forward. They push or pull the plane through the air and help it gain speed for takeoff and maintain speed during flight.\nAll these parts work together to make flying possible and safe.

[SEP] Response: On June 13, 2010, at 1818 Pacific Daylight Time, InterStar Airways Flight 293, landed at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), San Francisco, California, with the nose wheels cocked at 90 degrees. InterStar Airways was operating the airplane as a scheduled domestic passenger flight. The captain, first officer, four flight attendants, and 141 passengers were not injured. The flight departed Oakland, California, at 1531 as a non-stop to Sky Harbor International Airport, Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nThe captain noted no problems during the initial departure, and observed a positive rate of climb. The flight crew noted an error message displayed on the control board. There was a fault message for a nose landing gear shock absorber.  The data indicated that the gear handle was positioned to the down position, and there was an error message of a fault for the nose wheel steering.  \n\nThe flight diverted to San Jose, California. The captain was asked to perform a flyby of the tower for verification on the gear status. The tower, InterStar ground personnel, and a local news helicopter advised him that the nose gear was cocked 90 degrees to the left. When he found out this information, the captain decided to divert to SFO because it had optimum field conditions, a longer runway, and a better emergency support services. The crew flew for several hours to burn fuel so that they could land at a lighter weight.\n\nThe captain advised the cabin crew that in the event that the nose gear collapsed, evacuation from the front doors was not available so everyone would deplane from the rear exits. The flight crew continually updated the cabin crew and passengers about the situation, and advised the cabin crew to prepare for emergency procedures.  \n\nThe captain flew the airplane for the landing. He touched down at 120 knots, and applied normal braking at 90 knots. He held the nose gear off of the ground as long as possible. At 60 knots, the flight crew shut down the engines. They did not use reverse thrust or auto-braking. During the landing, the forward cabin crew could smell burnt rubber. The air traffic control tower confirmed that there was no fire, and the captain announced this to the cabin crew. After this notification, the passengers deplaned normally using an air stair.\n\nUpon touchdown, the tires rapidly deflated and tore apart, and both wheels were worn into the axle. During landing, the airplane's trajectory was not affected by the abnormal configuration or subsequent tire destruction, and the airplane stayed on the runway centerline.

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Robots are becoming increasingly integrated into various aspects of life in India, revolutionizing industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, and even customer service. In factories, robots enhance efficiency and precision by performing repetitive tasks, while in hospitals, robotic surgeries and diagnostic tools are saving lives with unparalleled accuracy. Agricultural robots are assisting farmers with tasks like planting, harvesting, and monitoring crop health, addressing labor shortages and improving productivity.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find metaphor and questioning to be the most useful. Metaphors are powerful because they allow me to express abstract ideas in a more tangible, relatable way. By comparing one thing to another, I can deepen understanding and make my writing more vivid. For instance, saying “her smile was a beacon of hope” conveys emotion and imagery in a way that’s more engaging than simply stating “she smiled.” This ability to evoke feelings and images makes metaphor especially valuable in creative writing and persuasive pieces.\n\nQuestioning is another technique I frequently use, especially in brainstorming or problem-solving. Asking \"what if\" or \"why\" helps me explore ideas from different angles, uncover deeper meanings, or drive the plot forward. It also opens up the conversation, whether I’m writing an essay, a story, or even a dialogue. Together, metaphor and questioning help me clarify my thoughts and express them in a more engaging, thoughtful manner, making my writing both clearer and more dynamic.\n [SEP] Correction: <input>Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find metaphor and questioning to be the most useful.

What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Developing leadership qualities involves a blend of self-awareness, continuous learning, and practical experience. From observing others and understanding leadership dynamics, I've noticed that effective leaders often exhibit qualities such as empathy, integrity, and resilience. Empathy allows leaders to connect with their team, understand their needs, and foster a supportive environment. Integrity builds trust and sets a standard for ethical behavior. Resilience helps leaders navigate challenges and setbacks with a positive attitude.\n\nI believe everyone has the potential to be a leader, but it requires dedication and a willingness to grow. Leadership is not just about holding a position of authority; it's about influencing and inspiring others. By seeking feedback, embracing challenges, and staying committed to personal development, anyone can cultivate leadership skills. Additionally, learning from mentors and observing successful leaders can provide valuable insights and guidance.\n\nIn essence, leadership is a journey of continuous improvement and self-discovery.

Empathy allows leaders to connect with their team, understand their needs, and foster a supportive environment. Integrity builds trust and sets a standard for ethical behavior. Resilience helps leaders navigate challenges and setbacks with a positive attitude.\n\nI believe everyone has the potential to be a leader, but it requires dedication and a willingness to grow. Leadership is not just about holding a position of authority; it's about influencing and inspiring others. By seeking feedback, embracing challenges, and staying committed to personal development, anyone can cultivate leadership skills. Additionally, learning from mentors and observing successful leaders can provide valuable insights and guidance.\n\nIn essence, leadership is a journey of continuous improvement and self-discovery. By focusing on key qualities and being open to learning, anyone can develop the potential to lead effectively.</input>", "task_id": "ce3f3898-f2a7-4978-8f4f-17596f229f1d", "ef_level": 12.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: he North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a landmark trade accord between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which came into effect in January 1994 after years of negotiation. Its primary goal was to eliminate or significantly reduce customs duties and trade barriers among the three member countries, thereby promoting free trade and economic integration across North America.\n\nNAFTA had a profound impact on trade relations, particularly in sectors like agriculture. For example, it facilitated the large-scale export of Mexican fruits and vegetables to the U.S., enhancing food availability and lowering prices. The agreement also encouraged cross-border investments and the development of integrated supply chains, especially in manufacturing and automotive industries.\n\nHowever, NAFTA’s effects were not uniformly positive. While it boosted overall trade and economic growth, it also led to job displacements in certain industries, particularly in manufacturing sectors in the U.S. and Canada.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 7.0 [SEP] Prompt: Summarize the report, using your own words. Write 8-10 lines. Compare your text with the model. [SEP] Response: On June 13, 2010, InterStar Airways Flight 293 encountered a significant landing gear issue that led to a challenging landing at San Francisco International Airport. The flight, which took off from Oakland en route to Phoenix, encountered a fault message for the nose landing gear shortly after departure. The crew initially diverted to San Jose but later chose San Francisco for its better runway and emergency facilities after a flyby confirmed the nose gear was rotated 90 degrees. Before landing, the crew burned fuel to reduce the aircraft's weight and prepared passengers for a potential emergency evacuation.

I know you’ve all come here with great enthusiasm and a desire to be part of something special, and I can promise you, Frisko Shipping is exactly that. But don’t just take my word for it—let’s dive into the story behind our global success and see why you’re joining a team that’s truly exceptional.\n\nLet me begin with a brief history.\nFrisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko, a visionary with a passion for global trade. What started as a small shipping company has now grown into a powerhouse with locations in 20 cities across the world. With over 5,000 employees, we’ve built an international network that moves millions of goods every day, connecting markets and communities in ways that many companies only dream of.\n\nLast year, we achieved a profit of 5 million dollars and captured 10% of the global market.

We believe that people are at the heart of everything we do. We want you to bring your enthusiasm, your motivation, and your drive to the table. New employees like you are expected to bring fresh ideas and energy into the company, and in return, we promise you’ll be part of a company that values growth, creativity, and a strong sense of teamwork.\n\nNow, let me share an anecdote about Bill Frisko himself.\nMany of you may already know that Bill’s journey to founding Frisko Shipping wasn’t a typical one. In fact, it was an experience that could’ve been the end of his career. On one of his early adventures, Bill fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. But rather than letting this life-changing moment defeat him, Bill saw it as a sign to make a change. In fact, the very ship that rescued him became the inspiration for the birth of Frisko Shipping. Bill often says that you can find inspiration in the most unexpected places—even in the middle of a life-threatening situation. And that’s the kind of mindset we value here. Anything can happen, and with the right perspective, it can lead to incredible opportunities.\n\nBefore I finish, I want to make sure you’re thinking ahead—not just about what Frisko Shipping is today, but about what we can become together. So, here’s a little challenge for you: How much do you really know about the company you’ve just joined? I’d like to kick things off with a fun quiz to see how many facts you’ve already picked up. It’s a great way to test your knowledge and get you even more excited about being a part of our journey.\n\nIn conclusion, as you step into your new roles, remember that you’re not just joining a company—you’re joining a movement. A movement that began with a spark of inspiration and has grown into something truly global.

[SEP] Response:   In the tort action case in which Mr. Medina was found guilty of trespassing on the Byrons’ home, I found the judge’s verdict to be appropriate. \n\n  Firstly, we should examine the legal assessment process. Trespassing is considered a criminal offense. Therefore, the action of breaking into private property, regardless of the motivation, constitutes an infraction in its own right. If Mr. Medina had knocked on the Byrons' door calling for help, he would have been in a less compromised legal position, as his intentions wouldn't have been subject to judicial questioning. On the contrary, like all citizens, the Byrons are obligated to assist in cases of emergency. Secondly, ransacking the house and displacing personal items can be considered a violent act, which is likely to cause not only material losses, but also psychological distress to the Byrons. Thirdly, the fine imposed by the judge is fair, as it compensates the family for the direct costs associated with the physical damages, along with an additional amount that includes intangible ones. Finally, I agree with the judge that Mr. Medina perform 300 hours of community service to compensate for his actions.

[SEP] Response: Dear Harry, first of all: \"A warm welcome\" to our Company!\" and thank you for asking me suggestions about how to better deal with your subordinates. In my opinion the main thing is to treat everyone with respect, regardless the hierarchy, and to listen to them even when they are complaining. Another advice is to make them feel part of the Company and that the Company really cares of them and their wellbeing, since Company's success depends on their individual contribution. This is because it is important that they are rewarded for their job when they achieve results, and that they have a good work-life balance too. Do not be afraid of offering training to them when needed to improve their performances, act as their mentor. I am sure they will be grateful to you in the future and this can help build up a stronger professional relationship and willingness to cooperate with you. Should you instead take credit for work done by them, or blame them for mistakes that are your responsibility, then I am afraid you would lose their trust and exsteem and working together everyday could become a real struggle.

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: The Challenges of Language Learning: Overcoming Common Hurdles\n\nLearning a new language can be an exciting yet daunting journey. Many students face a variety of challenges that can make the process seem overwhelming. What are some of these common issues, and how can they be addressed?\n\nOne major challenge is vocabulary retention. Students often struggle to remember new words and phrases. This can be mitigated by using flashcards, engaging in regular practice, and immersing oneself in the language through media like movies, music, and books.\n\nAnother issue is pronunciation. Many learners find it difficult to master the sounds of a new language, especially if they are very different from their native tongue. Practicing with native speakers, using language learning apps, and listening to the language as much as possible can help improve pronunciation.\n\nGrammar is another stumbling block. The rules of a new language can be complex and different from what students are used to. Breaking down grammar rules into smaller, manageable parts and practicing them in context can make them easier to understand and remember.\n\nConfidence is also a significant barrier. Many students fear making mistakes and feel embarrassed when speaking. It's important to remember that making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process. Joining language exchange groups or practicing with friends can help build confidence.\n\nFinally, consistency is key. Regular practice is essential for language acquisition. Setting aside dedicated time each day for language study and practice can lead to steady progress.

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In my country, robots are increasingly being used in various sectors, especially in manufacturing, healthcare, and customer service. In factories, robots assist in assembling products with precision and speed, reducing human error and increasing productivity. In hospitals, robotic surgical systems help doctors perform delicate procedures with greater accuracy, while service robots in banks, malls, and airports assist customers with basic tasks and information. I feel both impressed and cautious about this growing presence of robots. On the one hand, they can improve efficiency, safety, and convenience in our daily lives. On the other hand, I worry about the potential loss of jobs and overdependence on machines. As robots take on more roles, society may benefit from reduced labor costs and improved quality of services, but this shift could also widen economic inequality and lead to social challenges.

Additionally, taking an active interest in your employees' career paths by offering training and mentorship will show that you care about their growth and development.\n\nA healthy work-life balance is also essential. Recognizing that employees have personal lives outside of work will help reduce burnout and increase overall satisfaction. Listening to your employees is another vital point; people feel valued when they are heard, even if they are voicing complaints. Moreover, treating your subordinates with respect and empathy fosters a positive environment where everyone feels supported.\n\nOn the flip side, here are some things to avoid that could demotivate your staff: disrespecting subordinates, taking credit for their work, losing your temper, allowing unfair blame, and failing to acknowledge good work.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful!

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Although I admire talent and dedication, I feel compelled to criticize the idea of celebrity culture in general, especially how it often promotes superficial values over genuine substance. To begin with, one major criticism is that many celebrities are celebrated more for their appearance and curated lifestyles than for any meaningful contribution to society. While it’s true that some use their fame to raise awareness for important causes, it’s disappointing that the media still tends to reward scandal and controversy instead of integrity and hard work. Another point worth mentioning is that celebrity culture fuels unrealistic expectations, particularly for young people. It encourages people to compare themselves constantly, which can lead to low self-esteem and even mental health issues. I’m not saying that all celebrities are to blame, but the system as a whole is problematic. It would be better if we shifted our focus from idolizing people for their wealth or status to valuing those who make a real difference in their communities. In short, the obsession with celebrities is, in my opinion, rather unhealthy. It would be more beneficial for society if we celebrated kindness, creativity, and authenticity instead of fame for fame’s sake.\n [SEP] Correction: <input>Although I admire talent and dedication, I feel compelled to criticize the idea of celebrity culture in general, especially how it often promotes superficial values over genuine substance.

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the introduced techniques, free writing and loop writing appear most useful. Free writing allows for a spontaneous and unfettered exploration of ideas, overcoming writer's block and fostering creativity. Loop writing builds upon this by providing a structured framework to refine and develop those initial ideas into coherent narratives.

Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: When I was a student, we could only study from printed books. Digital publishing changed everything. People read on tablets, e-readers, laptops, and desktop computers. Instead of carrying a heavy backpack full of textbooks, I'm surprised to see students now doing all their homework on a tablet. These days, the use of books is becoming increasingly limited.\nStudents simply click a link on their devices; a pop-up window will immediately provide them with useful information. Even better, a video might appear with an explanation. Electronic media also allows font sizes to be changed for easier reading. Artificial intelligence is also increasingly providing more information, but we must be very careful with its use.\nAnother big difference with digital media is that anyone can self-publish easily and affordably. In other words, you can create your own original publications:\non various topics, for example, mathematics, on a website, an essay for a blog, or even an e-book for a publisher or online bookstore. As a result, there are millions of fascinating texts to read that were previously unavailable. Our personal world is expanding thanks to electronic media.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 7.0 [SEP] Prompt: As there were a few problems with Cessna 123's landing, you have been asked to write a report by your superiors. Write the report below. Write 100 - 150 words. [SEP] Response: Communication between pilots and the air control tower is essential for safe and efficient air travel. This begins even before takeoff, with pilots receiving departure clearance, flight plans, and weather updates. Once airborne, pilots stay in constant contact with control towers, updating their position, altitude, and speed.\nThe language used is precise and standardized to avoid misunderstandings, with specific terms and phrases set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Numbers are articulated clearly, and time is given in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\nAs the aircraft nears its destination, communication is crucial. Pilots receive descent, approach, and landing instructions, often navigating busy airspace. The control tower ensures safe distances between aircraft. In emergencies, this communication is vital for pilots to receive immediate assistance and information.\nIn summary, continuous dialogue between pilots and air control towers is critical for safe and orderly air traffic management worldwide.

Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying home is everyone's dream. Everyone wants to buy a home when they are young so that we can enjoy to the fullest. However getting home for oneself is not that easy now a days. It's really expensive and to buy a decent home one's whole savings goes into the drain. Loans are there. We can take home loans from financial institution. However rate of interest is still the issue. People are taking loans and till the age of 60 to 70 they are clearing their loans. Also with the issue of employment in our country people are not secure of their job , hence one feels its quite risky and scare to take home loans. Banks allure us with different rates and their marketing . But to be honest it's not an easy thing to go for it.

What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Developing leadership qualities is often a combination of self-awareness, experience, and continuous learning. I've seen that great leaders are not born, but made through effort and reflection. One essential quality is emotional intelligence — the ability to understand and manage your emotions, as well as those of others. Leaders who can empathize and communicate effectively tend to inspire trust and build stronger teams.\n\nAnother key trait is resilience. Challenges and setbacks are inevitable, but the best leaders handle them with a positive mindset, using failures as learning experiences. This quality can be developed by embracing difficult situations rather than avoiding them.\n\nI’ve also observed that humility plays a huge role. Effective leaders don’t act as if they know everything. They are open to feedback and willing to admit when they’re wrong, which makes them approachable and respected.\n\nIn my opinion, almost everyone has the potential to be a leader if they’re willing to work on themselves and embrace these qualities.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I believe that companies do have a responsibility to society, and this goes beyond just making a profit for their shareholders. While it’s important for businesses to be profitable, they also operate in communities that support them. These communities, as well as the environment, play a key role in their success. Companies should consider their impact on these areas and contribute to their well-being.\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) can lead to long-term benefits for companies. For example, by adopting sustainable business practices, companies can protect resources for the future while also reducing their carbon footprint. Providing fair wages and good working conditions for employees can lead to higher job satisfaction, lower turnover, and greater productivity. This is not only beneficial for the company but also for the individuals and families it supports.\n\nAdditionally, consumers are increasingly aware of companies’ social and environmental impacts. They are more likely to support businesses that demonstrate ethical behavior and contribute positively to society. A strong CSR program can help build trust and loyalty among customers, which ultimately helps the company’s bottom line.\n\nIn conclusion, CSR is not just about charity or public image.

The defendant argued that he believed the house was empty, was scared, and only sought temporary shelter. However, it was confirmed that Medina ransacked various areas of the home, intensifying the sense of threat experienced by the family. The court ruled that Medina’s actions constituted criminal trespassing. As a result, he was fined 1,000 monetary units, to be paid in two installments—one immediately.

He awarded Mr. and Mrs. Byron $1,000 in damages, divided into $500 as a base amount and $500 as an extended amount, to be paid immediately by Mr. Medina. Mr. Medina must also perform 300 hours of community service because the judge ruled that the offender had violated the Byrons' trust by subjecting them to unwanted intrusion into their lives.

Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: In my country, Brazil, buying a home and applying for a home loan can be a challenging and time-consuming process. First, property prices in major cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are quite high, especially in central or well-developed neighborhoods. For many people, buying a house without a loan is almost impossible, so most rely on financing options offered by banks or government programs like “Minha Casa, Minha Vida.”\n\nThe process of applying for a home loan usually involves a lot of paperwork. Applicants must provide proof of income, employment history, tax returns, identification documents, and sometimes even a credit history report. The bank will carefully evaluate the borrower’s financial situation before approving the loan.\n\nInterest rates in Brazil tend to be higher than in some other countries. They usually range from 8% to 12% per year, depending on the applicant’s profile, the chosen bank, and the loan term. Recently, government incentives and lower Selic rates have slightly reduced mortgage rates, but they are still considered expensive.\n\nUsing a real estate agent is not required, but many people choose to work with one to help find suitable properties and negotiate with sellers.

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is composed of several key components, each serving a specific function to ensure flight and stability. The fuselage is the central body of the airplane, designed to accommodate passengers, cargo, and the cockpit. It provides structural support and is streamlined to minimize air resistance.\n\nThe wings are critical for flight, as they generate lift by interacting with the airflow. The shape of the wings, known as the airfoil, helps create a pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces, allowing the airplane to ascend and remain airborne. Wings also house the ailerons and flaps, which assist in controlling roll and adjusting lift during takeoff and landing.\n\nThe tail of an airplane, also known as the empennage, includes the vertical and horizontal stabilizers. The vertical stabilizer, or fin, prevents yawing, which is the side-to-side motion of the aircraft. Attached is the rudder, used to steer the aircraft left or right. The horizontal stabilizer assists in maintaining pitch stability, with the elevators attached to control the ascent and descent.\n\nEngines are the powerhouses of the airplane, providing the thrust necessary to propel it forward. They can be mounted on the wings or the fuselage and are crucial for generating the speed required for lift-off and sustaining flight.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: The current situation of the Spanish real estate market is broadly characterised by the high demand for housing, especially new construction, and the shortage of supply. As a result of this mismatch between supply and demand, the price of housing continues to rise. The average price of new housing in Spain has reached €2,930/m² in June 2024, with large cities such as Barcelona (€5,262/m²) and Madrid (€4,493/m²) having the highest demand, the lowest supply and, consequently, the highest prices. All these factors, combined with the fact that the average salary in Spain is relatively low, around €2,200 gross per month, mean that most people have to apply for a bank loan to buy their home. \n\nIn Spain, you can buy a home through real estate agencies or from individual to individual. Buying a property from an individual offers personalised service and saves on commissions, while real estate agencies offer expert advice and speed up the paperwork. \n\nOnce you have found the perfect house, it is time to face the process of applying for a loan. The main requirements of banks when granting a mortgage have to do with the applicant's financial situation. In order to know the stability and good current and future financial solvency of the client, the bank asks for pay slips and work history, and checks that he or she has no other outstanding debts. \n\nA good tip when applying for a loan, is to compare different mortgage loan offers from different banking entities. During this process, you also have to decide which type of mortgage best fits your financial situation: \n- Fixed rate: the same installment and the same interest rate during the life of the mortgage. \n- Variable rate: the interest rate, and consequently the installment, vary depending on the reference index published by the banking entities, which is reviewed every 6 months. \n- Mixed rate: a fixed rate is applied during the first years of the loan and then a variable interest rate is applied.\n\nAnother aspect to take into account is the fees associated with the application and granting of the mortgage loan:\n- Opening fee: paid to the bank at the beginning of the loan for paperwork and management.\n- Account fee associated with the mortgage: opening an account, with associated fees, to manage the payment of the installments.\n\nIn addition, we must not forget that mortgages have a financing limit of up to 80% of the value of the property, as well as an amortization period ranging from 20 to 30 years. \n\nIn short, taking out a mortgage is a long process that requires taking time to carefully study the options and possibilities in order to obtain the best financing.

[SEP] Response: Strategic Summary\nThe proposed boutique hotel, Zen, will cater to the growing demand for wellness-focused weekend getaways. Market research from the AccomData Group highlights increasing consumer interest in healthy lifestyles and relaxing resort experiences. Zen will differentiate itself by integrating a spa, fitness center, and hotel into one luxurious retreat. Unlike traditional fitness centers that often lack satisfying food options, Zen will offer a nutritious gourmet menu crafted by top chefs from renowned restaurants. Guests will have access to fully equipped gyms, swimming pools, and trained instructors to enhance their stay. The estimated construction period is two years, with returns expected from the second year post-opening. The projected annual profit from year three onward is $1 million, allowing investors to recoup the $4 million investment within four years and begin earning profits by year five.\n\nRisk Assessment\nThe financial projections account for potential economic downturns. Should the economy remain stable, the investment recovery and profit timeline could accelerate significantly, potentially reducing the recoupment period by half. Furthermore, a comprehensive media campaign is scheduled in partnership with Kudos Advertising Agency to build brand recognition and attract a strong customer base early on.
