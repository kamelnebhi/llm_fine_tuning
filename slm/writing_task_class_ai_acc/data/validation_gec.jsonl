{"text": "Prompt Level: 7.0 [SEP] Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is made up of several important parts, each with a specific function that helps it fly safely and efficiently. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane. It is where passengers and cargo are carried, and it also connects all the other parts of the aircraft. Inside the fuselage, you can find the cockpit, where the pilots control the airplane.\n\nThe wings are essential for flight. They are designed to create lift as the airplane moves through the air. This lift is what allows the airplane to rise off the ground and stay in the sky. Wings can also hold fuel tanks and sometimes house the landing gear.\n\nAt the back of the airplane is the tail, which helps keep the airplane stable and balanced during flight. The tail has smaller parts like the horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer, which control the pitch (up and down movement) and yaw (side to side movement) of the airplane.\n\nFinally, the engines provide the power needed to move the airplane forward. As the engines push the airplane ahead, air flows over the wings, creating lift. Together, these parts work as a team to make flying possible.

[SEP] Response: Over the past six months, the Hang Seng Index (HSI), which is the main stock market index in Hong Kong, has shown a strong and steady upward trend. This rise is mainly driven by significant investment flows coming from Mainland China.

This substantial growth reflects both external interest and local economic strength.\n\nAccording to market analysts, the index is expected to continue its positive momentum in the coming year.

Why do some students give up? Progress may seem slow, especially without immediate rewards or real-life practice.\n\nFinally, lack of exposure is a common problem.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 7.0 [SEP] Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is composed of several key components, each serving a specific function to ensure flight and stability. The fuselage is the central body of the airplane, designed to accommodate passengers, cargo, and the cockpit. It provides structural support and is streamlined to minimize air resistance.\n\nThe wings are critical for flight, as they generate lift by interacting with the airflow. The shape of the wings, known as the airfoil, helps create a pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces, allowing the airplane to ascend and remain airborne. Wings also house the ailerons and flaps, which assist in controlling roll and adjusting lift during takeoff and landing.\n\nThe tail of an airplane, also known as the empennage, includes the vertical and horizontal stabilizers. The vertical stabilizer, or fin, prevents yawing, which is the side-to-side motion of the aircraft. Attached is the rudder, used to steer the aircraft left or right. The horizontal stabilizer assists in maintaining pitch stability, with the elevators attached to control the ascent and descent.\n\nEngines are the powerhouses of the airplane, providing the thrust necessary to propel it forward. They can be mounted on the wings or the fuselage and are crucial for generating the speed required for lift-off and sustaining flight. Together, these parts work in harmony to achieve controlled and efficient aviation.

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In my country, robots are increasingly being used across various sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture. In manufacturing, robots help automate assembly lines, boosting efficiency and reducing the risk of human error. In healthcare, robotic-assisted surgeries and diagnostic tools are improving precision and enabling quicker recovery times for patients. Robots are also being deployed in agriculture to monitor crops and assist in harvesting, ensuring better yields with less human labor. Personally, I feel a mix of excitement and concern about the growing presence of robots. On the positive side, they can free up human workers from dangerous, repetitive, or strenuous tasks, potentially improving quality of life. They can also help address labor shortages in industries like healthcare and agriculture. However, there are concerns about job displacement and the ethical implications of relying on robots for essential tasks. While robots could bring greater efficiency and innovation, they could also lead to increased inequality if large numbers of workers are left unemployed or underemployed. The challenge will be to balance technological advancement with social responsibility.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 7.0 [SEP] Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is made up of several key parts, each serving a specific function to enable flight. The **fuselage** is the main body of the aircraft, housing the cockpit, passengers, and cargo. It provides structural support and connects all other components.\n\nThe **wings** are essential for generating lift. As air flows over and under the wings, their shape creates an upward force that allows the plane to rise and stay aloft. Wings may also contain fuel tanks and support devices like flaps and ailerons, which help control the aircraft's direction and stability.\n\nThe **tail**, or empennage, consists of the horizontal stabilizer and vertical fin. These structures help maintain balance and control. The horizontal stabilizer ensures pitch stability (up and down movement), while the vertical fin helps the plane maintain a straight course by stabilizing yaw (side-to-side movement).\n\nLastly, the **engines** provide the thrust needed for the airplane to move forward. Modern airplanes typically use jet engines or turboprops, which propel the aircraft and enable the wings to generate lift.\n\nTogether, these parts work in harmony to make flight possible.

[SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility: A Moral and Strategic Imperative\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is not just a moral obligation—it is a strategic imperative in today’s interconnected and socially conscious world. Companies are no longer isolated entities existing solely to maximize shareholder profits. They operate within societies, rely on local communities for labor and resources, and depend on consumer trust to thrive. Therefore, they must also contribute meaningfully to those communities and uphold sustainable, ethical practices.\n\nCritics often invoke Milton Friedman’s view that the sole purpose of business is profit. While profit is essential, this narrow interpretation is outdated in the context of modern capitalism. CSR and profitability are not mutually exclusive. Companies that prioritize fair labor practices, environmental sustainability, and community engagement often see improved employee satisfaction, customer loyalty, and brand value. As Jack@MSU rightly pointed out, CSR contributes to the bottom line because consumers increasingly care about corporate values.\n\nFurthermore, leaving all social responsibility to governments ignores the immense power and influence multinational corporations now wield. Regulations are necessary but insufficient. Corporations must go beyond compliance and actively invest in social and environmental causes if they wish to remain credible and relevant.\n\nUltimately, responsible corporate behavior should not be viewed as charity or mere marketing.

It came into effect in January 1994, after several years of negotiation. The agreement aimed to reduce or eliminate customs duties and other trade barriers between the three nations, promoting smoother and more efficient trade across borders.\n\nOne of NAFTA’s most notable impacts has been in the agricultural sector. To be more specific, Mexican fruits and vegetables have flowed more easily into the U.S., benefiting consumers and producers alike. While the agreement has provided significant trade opportunities, it has also created challenges, such as job displacement in certain industries and concerns about environmental impacts.\n\nDespite these challenges, NAFTA has had a profound overall impact, benefiting all three countries by fostering closer economic ties and improving trade relations.

[SEP] Response: Language is constantly evolving and it is important to make sure that there is no miscommunication. Language students often struggle with comprehension, pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, and fluency, while also struggling with motivation and fear of speaking. They might be demotivated or fear making mistakes in front of everyone. This limits their ability to express themselves in a more fluent open manner. For that we have various communication strategies available. \n\nFor example if we have given instruction to someone and we want to make sure that they have understood correctly, the more appropriate way would be to ask them to repeat what they have understood instead of just asking them if they have understood. \n\nIf we are speaking with a large group we can try to make eye contact and ensure that they are attentive and nodding their heads.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home in France, especially near Paris, can be both exciting and challenging. Prices are very high in this region, and the process involves several steps. For many people, one of the most complicated parts is applying for a home loan. It usually requires a lot of paperwork, including proof of income, bank statements, tax documents, and other financial details.

Although rates are starting to stabilize in 2025, they are still higher than they were a few years ago. This means that buying property now often requires a larger budget or a longer loan term.\n\nTo make things easier, many people choose to work with professionals. A real estate agent helps find suitable properties and negotiate the price, while a mortgage broker assists with finding the best loan offer and managing the application process. These experts can be very helpful, especially for first-time buyers.\n\nOverall, the process of buying a home in France is not necessarily difficult, but it does take time, preparation, and a good understanding of the system.

The truth is, lasting change doesn’t happen overnight. It’s not about making drastic shifts, but rather about committing to small actions consistently over time. Whether it’s reading for 10 minutes a day, taking a short walk every morning, or drinking more water, these tiny habits compound and create significant change in the long run.\n\nSmall habits are easier to maintain because they don’t require a complete overhaul of your life. They’re more sustainable, less overwhelming, and allow you to ease into bigger goals. As you build momentum, these actions become part of your routine and start to feel automatic, helping you improve productivity, health, and overall well-being.\n\nWhat’s more, small habits give you the flexibility to adjust and grow at your own pace. You’re not pressured to be perfect, and setbacks don’t derail your progress.

[SEP] Response: Hi Josh and Ken,\n\nAfter thinking about both of your ideas, I wanted to propose a third option that takes the best aspects of both suggestions, but with a clear focus on moving the business to the south end, where we can really cut costs and scale.\n\nHere’s the plan: we move the production to the south end of town, significantly lowering our rent and operating costs, but instead of abandoning the showroom experience altogether, we can create a more modern and efficient system to serve customers remotely.\n\nThe difference is: we send free fabric samples to customers before their fittings. This way, they can still experience the physical aspect of the clothing without needing to come into the store. We can include a range of sample swatches for each clothing line, helping customers make informed decisions from the comfort of their homes or offices.\n\nAdditionally, we can upgrade our website to make it a more seamless experience, where customers can browse fabric options, view detailed descriptions, and easily enter their measurements for custom orders. \n\nThe beauty of this option is that it combines cost savings with a personalized experience. We’d lose the physical showroom, but we’d create an innovative way for customers to interact with our products while still offering the personal service they value. Plus, with the lower rent, we can reinvest savings into improving our online presence.\n\nThis approach feels like a win-win: cutting overhead costs, maintaining high-quality service, and adapting to a changing market. \n\nLet me know your thoughts!\n\nThanks!\n\nRaquel [SEP] Correction: <input>Hi Josh and Ken,\n\nAfter <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"considering\">thinking about</code> both of your ideas, I<code a=\"ORTH\" c=\"\"> </code><code a=\"VERB\" c=\"'d like\">wanted</code> to propose a third option that takes the best aspects of both suggestions, but with a clear focus on moving the business to the south end<code a=\"PUNCT\" c=\" \">, </code>where we can really cut costs and scale.\n\nHere’s the plan: we move the production to the south end of town, significantly lowering our rent and operating costs, but instead of abandoning the showroom experience altogether, we can create a more modern and efficient system to serve customers remotely.\n\nThe difference is: we send free fabric samples to customers before their fittings.

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: n airplane has several important parts, each with a special job to help it fly safely and efficiently.\n\nThe fuselage is the main body of the airplane. It holds the cockpit, where the pilots sit, and the cabin, where passengers and cargo are carried. It connects all the other parts of the plane together.\n\nThe wings are large flat surfaces that stick out from the sides of the fuselage. They are designed to create lift, which allows the airplane to rise into the air and stay there. Many planes also have flaps on the wings that help control speed and direction.\n\nThe tail, also known as the empennage, is located at the back of the airplane. It includes the vertical stabilizer (which helps keep the plane flying straight) and the horizontal stabilizer (which helps control up and down movement). The tail helps the pilot keep the airplane balanced and stable during flight.\n\nFinally, the engines provide the thrust needed to move the airplane forward. Most commercial planes have jet engines, which pull in air, compress it, mix it with fuel, and then burn it to create power.\n\nEach part of the airplane plays a key role in helping it fly safely through the sky.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: As a self-proclaimed fangirl, I have spent my fair share of money, time and resources keeping up with my favorite artists, actors and personalities. That being said, I have come to realize it is OK to hold your “favs” accountable and criticize them when they act harmfully.\n\nCelebrities, like any other human being, can mess up. The only difference is that their mess-ups are public. While it may not seem fair, their popularity allows them to be held to a higher standard. More people have access to their content, and when they act in a harmful way, it makes that action seem OK to their following.\n\nTo stop this phenomenon, fans need to feel comfortable raising their voices, and other fans should not attack them when they do so. I think there is often a stigma within fandoms that if you speak poorly about a celebrity, you’re not a real fan.\n\nThink again.\n\nBy checking the behavior of celebrities, you are encouraging them to learn and grow from their mistakes, which inadvertently makes them better human beings and examples for their following.\n\nFor example, when Lizzo released a snippet of her single “Grrrls” back in June, it contained an ableist slur. While the term may have a different connotation in the U.S. than in the U.K., the term still originates from “spastic,” which describes the movements of people who experience spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy.

More people have access to their content, and when they act in a harmful way, it makes that action seem <code a=\"ADJ\" c=\"okay\">OK</code> to their following.\n\nTo stop this phenomenon, fans need to feel comfortable raising their voices, and other fans should not attack them when they do so. <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"There\">I think there</code> is often a stigma within fandoms that if you speak poorly about a celebrity, you’re not a real fan.<code a=\"PHRA\" c=\" \">\n\n</code>Think again.\n\nBy checking the behavior of celebrities, you are encouraging them to learn and grow from their mistakes, which inadvertently makes them better human beings and examples for their following<code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"\">.\n\nFor example, when Lizzo released a snippet of her single “Grrrls” back in June, it contained an ableist slur.

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning can be an exciting yet challenging experience for many students. One of the most common difficulties is overcoming the fear of making mistakes. Many learners hesitate to speak because they worry about being judged or misunderstood. This fear often slows down progress, as practice is essential for developing fluency. How can we get better if we don’t put ourselves out there and make errors along the way?\n\nAnother challenge is vocabulary retention. It’s easy to forget new words, especially when they aren’t used in everyday situations. This can be frustrating, especially for beginners who are trying to build their foundational knowledge. How can students keep track of all the words they encounter in their lessons and retain them long-term?\n\nGrammar is another hurdle. Unlike vocabulary, grammar rules can be complex and sometimes difficult to internalize. For example, in languages with multiple tenses or gendered nouns, students may struggle to get things right. How can learners remember all the rules and apply them correctly in conversation?\n\nFinally, cultural differences can also be tricky to navigate. Language isn’t just about words; it’s about understanding the cultural context in which those words are used. How can students bridge the gap between the language they’re learning and the culture behind it?\n\nDespite these challenges, persistence and patience are key to success in language learning.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Metaphor is an incredibly important tool for students in their writing for several key reasons, extending far beyond mere literary embellishment. Primarily, metaphors serve as powerful cognitive bridges, helping students to clarify and simplify complex or abstract ideas by linking them to more concrete and familiar concepts. For instance, explaining the function of the human heart as a \"pump\" or a complex political system as a \"web\" makes abstract notions immediately more graspable and memorable. This ability to make the intangible tangible is crucial for students grappling with new knowledge across all subjects.\nBeyond clarity, metaphors significantly enhance the descriptive power and emotional impact of student writing. Instead of simply stating facts, students can use metaphors to evoke vivid imagery and feelings, making their writing more engaging and persuasive. For example, describing a character's anger as a \"volcano ready to erupt\" is far more impactful than just saying \"the character was angry.\" This not only adds depth and sophistication to their prose but also encourages creative thinking, as students must identify subtle similarities between seemingly unrelated things. By mastering metaphors, students develop a more nuanced understanding of language, strengthen their critical thinking skills, and learn to communicate their ideas with greater precision, originality, and flair.

This is a great milestone for the team, especially given the challenges we faced just a few months ago.\nBack then, Crum flagged several unresolved defects that caused concern. On top of that, there were a few minor technical issues that added to the frustration. It was a tough spot, but also a wake-up call.\nSince then, we’ve made meaningful changes. We overhauled how we deliver updates to make the process smoother and more predictable.

[SEP] Response: Buying a home in India is a major life goal for many people, including me. But the process can be both exciting as well as challenging. The first step is usually to decide on a budget and preferred location. In most cases, people look for properties through real estate agencies or online broking websites. While using a real estate agency is not compulsory, it can make the search easier, especially for first time buyers.\n\nNext step is to check on the monetary condition and applying for a home loan as required. In most cases home loan is an essential part of the process, as real estate prices in major cities such as Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai can be expensive. The process of getting a loan involves submitting relevant documents such as identity proof, income proof, bank statements, proof of residency and applicable property documents. There is definitely a fair amount of paperwork involved. The interest rates on home loans in India generally range between 8 - 12 %, depending on the bank, credit score and loan tenure, Many banks now offer online application options, which make the process easier, but the loan approval can still take time.\n\nA mortgage broker is not necessary, but financial advisors or bank representatives can help guide through the different options. Overall, while buying home in India is definitely achievable, it does require, patience, planning, documentation and more importantly a good chunk of savings to make initial investment.

They often endorse harmful beauty standards, promote unhealthy products, or spread misinformation. The excessive adoration these celebrities receive fosters a culture where fame and wealth are seen as the ultimate goals, overshadowing important values such as integrity, hard work, and compassion. Instead of being role models, many celebrities contribute to a shallow, consumer-driven culture that prioritizes appearance and status over substance.

It officially came into effect in January 1994, after several years of complex negotiations. The main goal of NAFTA was to reduce or completely eliminate customs duties and other trade barriers among the three member countries, in order to encourage economic cooperation and integration.\nThe agreement has had a profound impact on trade relations within North America, particularly in the agricultural sector.

[SEP] Response: On June 13, 2010, at 1818 Pacific Daylight Time, InterStar Airways Flight 293, landed at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), San Francisco, California, with the nose wheels cocked at 90 degrees. InterStar Airways was operating the airplane as a scheduled domestic passenger flight. The captain, first officer, four flight attendants, and 141 passengers were not injured. The flight departed Oakland, California, at 1531 as a non-stop to Sky Harbor International Airport, Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nThe captain noted no problems during the initial departure, and observed a positive rate of climb. The flight crew noted an error message displayed on the control board. There was a fault message for a nose landing gear shock absorber.  The data indicated that the gear handle was positioned to the down position, and there was an error message of a fault for the nose wheel steering.  \n\nThe flight diverted to San Jose, California. The captain was asked to perform a flyby of the tower for verification on the gear status. The tower, InterStar ground personnel, and a local news helicopter advised him that the nose gear was cocked 90 degrees to the left. When he found out this information, the captain decided to divert to SFO because it had optimum field conditions, a longer runway, and a better emergency support services. The crew flew for several hours to burn fuel so that they could land at a lighter weight.\n\nThe captain advised the cabin crew that in the event that the nose gear collapsed, evacuation from the front doors was not available so everyone would deplane from the rear exits. The flight crew continually updated the cabin crew and passengers about the situation, and advised the cabin crew to prepare for emergency procedures.  \n\nThe captain flew the airplane for the landing. He touched down at 120 knots, and applied normal braking at 90 knots. He held the nose gear off of the ground as long as possible. At 60 knots, the flight crew shut down the engines. They did not use reverse thrust or auto-braking. During the landing, the forward cabin crew could smell burnt rubber. The air traffic control tower confirmed that there was no fire, and the captain announced this to the cabin crew. After this notification, the passengers deplaned normally using an air stair.\n\nUpon touchdown, the tires rapidly deflated and tore apart, and both wheels were worn into the axle. During landing, the airplane's trajectory was not affected by the abnormal configuration or subsequent tire destruction, and the airplane stayed on the runway centerline.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: In Support of Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nIn the contemporary global economy, corporations are not isolated entities operating solely for profit; they are integral components of the societies in which they function. As such, they bear a responsibility that extends beyond the interests of shareholders. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) represents a strategic and ethical commitment to sustainable development, social equity, and environmental stewardship.\n\nEngaging in CSR initiatives allows companies to foster trust and credibility among stakeholders, including customers, employees, and the broader community. By supporting educational programs, environmental conservation, and fair labor practices, corporations contribute to the long-term well-being of the societies that enable their success. These actions are not merely philanthropic—they are investments in a stable and prosperous operating environment.\n\nFurthermore, CSR enhances employee morale and retention, as individuals increasingly seek to work for organizations that reflect their personal values. Consumers, too, are more inclined to support brands that demonstrate genuine social and environmental concern. In this sense, CSR is not only ethically sound but also economically advantageous.\n\nWhile some critics argue that CSR is a superficial marketing strategy, its tangible benefits to both society and business performance are well-documented.

[SEP] Response: One legendary creature that I find fascinating is the Rakshasa from Indian mythology. Rakshasas are powerful, shape-shifting demons known for their cunning and magical abilities. They appear in many ancient Hindu epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Traditionally, Rakshasas are depicted as fearsome beings with sharp teeth, terrifying eyes, and sometimes multiple heads or arms.

While most are seen as evil and cruel, some are portrayed as noble or even wise. For example, Vibhishana, the brother of the demon king Ravana, is a Rakshasa who chooses to side with good and helps Lord Rama defeat his tyrannical brother.\n\nRakshasas are often seen as symbols of inner battles, representing human weaknesses like pride, anger, and greed. Stories about them carry strong moral lessons and are meant to guide people toward righteousness. Even today, they appear in modern books, films, and TV shows in South Asia, showing how deep their influence still runs. Their blend of menace, mystery, and moral symbolism makes them one of the most compelling creatures in mythology.

Remember to add the features the software company had not included (WMS software, real-time application across company and all clients, fully integrated web services), and also use some of your own ideas. Write 100-150 words. Use the text to help you. [SEP] Response: SCM is committed to improving the way a company finds the raw components that enable it to make a product and then delivers it to customers. There are five basic components of SCM: Plan, Source, Manufacture, Deliver and Return. This last area can be an especially problematic part of the supply chain. So what can be done? Bar codes only? Not anymore. Companies are now using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), tags that can identify what the product is, where it has been and when it expires – essentially whatever information a company wishes to program. Right now the major drawback is the high cost of building the infrastructure to manage RFID data and the consequent lack of ROI (return on investment).\n\nMany SCM applications are reliant upon the kind of information stored inside Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software and, in some cases, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) packages, making the cost very high. It can be a nightmare getting information flowing on a fast, reliable basis from all the areas of a company, especially if that company doesn’t collaborate with other companies to help lower costs.\n\nAnother important factor is ERM (Enterprise Resource Management). Recently, due to a decline in demand, distribution centers produced SKUs (stock-keeping units). However, this system created some serious problems and many companies soon replaced it with a JIT (just in time) system. Unfortunately, as a supplier adopts JIT and other ‘lean production’ concepts, it also tends to reduce its indirect labor and technical staff.\n\nUsing a CPFR (Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment) system helps a company develop clear business guidelines and roadmaps for various collaborative scenarios, including upstream suppliers and retailers. Sharing expenses between companies can be an effective way to reduce costs.\n\nAs companies search for new ways to reduce costs, collaboration is more and more becoming a key component in optimizing supply chain.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13.0 [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: \nThe debate over corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a significant one, reflecting differing perspectives on the role of businesses in society. Here's an opinion considering both sides of the argument:\n\nFor Corporate Social Responsibility:\n\nBusinesses undoubtedly have a profound impact on the communities and environments in which they operate. It is reasonable to assert that companies owe some level of responsibility to these communities, as suggested by lil@213. This view posits that business operations should be a reciprocal relationship, where communities facilitate business activities and, in return, businesses contribute positively to these communities. Additionally, sustainable operations and fair employee benefits are essential not just for ethical reasons but for pragmatic ones, ensuring long-term viability and productivity.\n\nMoreover, as Jack@MSU highlights, CSR often aligns with consumer values, thus becoming a driver of customer loyalty and ultimately benefiting the company's bottom line. In a world where consumers increasingly prioritize ethical considerations, CSR can bolster a company's reputation and foster a competitive edge. James.W@efstudent.com adds that corporations, as integral components of society, should adhere to societal expectations, which increasingly include contributions to social and environmental well-being.\n\nAgainst Corporate Social Responsibility:\n\nOn the other hand, critics like theG8T argue from a traditional economic standpoint, emphasizing that a corporation's primary duty is to its shareholders, as famously noted by economist Milton Friedman. From this perspective, businesses should focus on maximizing profits rather than attempting to meet broader social responsibilities. JackD_92 points out that CSR initiatives are often negligible compared to a company's total earnings, suggesting that they might serve more as marketing strategies rather than genuine efforts to effect change.\n\nPatty925 raises an important point about the role of government in regulating corporate behavior. The argument here is that societal welfare should primarily be safeguarded by governmental policies and laws, rather than relying on corporations to voluntarily take on these responsibilities. This perspective suggests that while businesses should comply with regulations, it is not their role to lead societal change.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, while corporations should prioritize profitability to satisfy shareholder interests, they cannot ignore their broader impact on society. CSR can provide a bridge between these objectives, offering benefits to both the community and the business itself through enhanced reputation and consumer loyalty. However, it is essential for governments to set and enforce regulations that ensure businesses contribute positively to societal goals, balancing corporate interests with public welfare. In essence, both corporations and governments have roles to play in fostering a sustainable and equitable society.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Free writing is a technique where a writer expresses thoughts without worrying about grammar, structure, or correctness. The goal is to let the mind flow freely, bypassing internal censorship and encouraging creativity. It is often used as a warm-up exercise or a way to overcome writer's block. In free writing, the writer simply writes continuously for a set period of time—usually around 10 to 20 minutes—without pausing to edit or analyze what is being written.\n\nThe beauty of free writing lies in its ability to release mental barriers. By removing the pressure of perfection, it allows writers to explore ideas without judgment. This can help uncover new insights or directions for further writing. Free writing can also serve as a tool for emotional release, allowing individuals to process thoughts and feelings in a safe, non-judgmental space.\n\nMoreover, free writing promotes the flow of ideas, which can later be shaped into coherent narratives or essays. It’s often used in both creative and academic settings to generate raw material that can be refined later. Free writing nurtures creativity, enhances writing skills, and fosters personal growth, making it an invaluable practice for anyone looking to improve their writing and clarity of thought.\n\n\n\n\n [SEP] Correction: <input><code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning, and cubing.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I strongly believe that companies do have a responsibility to society, and this responsibility goes beyond simply making profits for their shareholders. Corporations operate within communities, and their actions have a direct impact on the well-being of those communities. It's not enough to focus solely on financial gains; companies should also contribute to the social and environmental health of the areas where they do business. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) can lead to long-term success, as it fosters goodwill, attracts loyal customers, and enhances a company’s public image.\n\nFor example, when companies adopt sustainable practices, they not only protect the environment but also ensure future resources and maintain their reputation. Similarly, offering fair employee benefits promotes job satisfaction, reduces turnover, and increases productivity. Companies that act in the best interests of both their shareholders and society are more likely to thrive in the long run. The company became an essential part of the society environment. \n\nWhile critics argue that CSR can be a mere marketing tool or that the government should handle societal issues, I believe that companies, as integral parts of society, have a moral duty to contribute positively.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 7.0 [SEP] Prompt: Your friend is about to open a secondhand clothes shop. He doesn’t have much capital, and is renting a very old building. He has got a few quotes for property and liability insurance, but they have been very high. He asks you to do a risk assessment of the premises. Have a look at your checklist, then write him an email advising him of the changes he has to make. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Subject: Important Risk Assessment Advice for Your Shop\n\nHi Murillo,\n\nI hope you’re doing well! I took a close look at your shop premises and the insurance quotes you’ve received. Given that the building is quite old, it’s understandable why the premiums are high. However, there are some changes you can make to reduce risks and possibly lower your insurance costs.\n\nFirst, the blocked drainpipes and leaky roof on the exterior should be fixed as soon as possible to prevent water damage and structural problems. Also, the untidy yard and cluttered sidewalk can pose safety hazards, so clearing these areas is important.\n\nInside the shop, poor lighting and stacked boxes increase the risk of accidents.

I took a close look at your shop premises and the insurance quotes you’ve received. Given that the building is quite old, it’s understandable why the premiums are high. However, there are some changes you can make to reduce risks and possibly lower your insurance costs.\n\nFirst, the blocked drainpipes and leaky roof on the exterior should be fixed as soon as possible to prevent water damage and structural problems. Also, the untidy yard and cluttered sidewalk can pose safety hazards, so clearing these areas is important.\n\nInside the shop, poor lighting and stacked boxes increase the risk of accidents. Improving lighting and organizing storage will help. The old fire extinguishers need to be replaced or serviced to meet safety standards. Lastly, loose chemicals should be securely stored to avoid any dangerous spills.\n\nMaking these improvements will not only protect your business and customers but may also convince insurers to offer you better rates. Let me know if you want help planning the repairs!\n\nBest,\nVictor</input>", "task_id": "9e54df01-235a-418f-9836-724a7d2eda5e", "ef_level": 7.0, "label": 5}

Faulty wiring is a common cause of fires.\n\n4. **Security**: Install adequate lighting outside and consider an alarm system or CCTV to prevent theft or vandalism, which can impact your insurance.\n\n5. **Health and Safety**: Keep walkways clear of obstructions and ensure your store is compliant with any local health and safety regulations.\n\nAddressing these issues will not only make your shop safer but might also lower your insurance costs.

Free writing involves writing continuously without worrying about grammar, punctuation, or even coherence. This technique allows me to express my thoughts freely and unlock my creativity, helping me overcome writer's block and discover new ideas. On the other hand, loop writing is a structured approach where I write about a topic, then review and expand on specific points, looping back to refine and deepen my understanding.

[SEP] Response: On June 13, 2010, InterStar Airways Flight 293 landed at San Francisco International Airport with its nose wheels cocked 90 degrees. The scheduled domestic flight from Oakland to Phoenix encountered a nose landing gear fault shortly after departure. The crew diverted to San Jose for a tower flyby, confirming the nose gear issue, and then proceeded to SFO due to better emergency support and runway conditions. The plane flew for hours to burn fuel, and passengers were briefed on emergency procedures. The captain skillfully landed at 120 knots, holding the nose gear off the ground as long as possible. Engines were shut down at 60 knots without using reverse thrust or auto-braking. Upon touchdown, the nose wheels deflated, tore apart, and wore into the axle but the aircraft remained on the runway centerline. Burnt rubber was detected, but there was no fire. All 141 passengers and crew deplaned safely using rear exits. The incident caused no injuries, and the plane's trajectory was unaffected.

It came into effect in January 1994 after years of negotiation. The primary goal of NAFTA was to eliminate barriers to trade and investment between the three countries, creating a trilateral trade bloc in North America.\n\nNAFTA significantly reduced or eliminated customs duties on most goods traded between the member countries, making it easier and more cost-effective for businesses to operate across borders. This agreement has had a profound effect on trade relations, especially in the agricultural sector. For instance, Mexican fruits and vegetables now flow more freely into the US market, benefiting consumers with more variety and lower prices.\n\nHowever, NAFTA has also faced criticism.

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Robots are increasingly being used in various industries in my country, from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare and retail. In factories, robots handle repetitive tasks such as assembly, packaging, and quality control, improving efficiency and reducing human error. In hospitals, robotic surgery systems help doctors perform precise, minimally invasive procedures. Additionally, robots are being used in warehouses for inventory management and in customer service roles, like reception or information desks. I feel both excited and cautious about the growing role of robots. On the one hand, they have the potential to improve productivity, reduce human labor in dangerous jobs, and even assist in tasks that improve health and safety. However, there are also concerns about job displacement, especially in industries that rely heavily on manual labor. As robots become more capable, there is a risk of unemployment for those whose skills are replaced by automation. Furthermore, there are ethical considerations, like ensuring privacy and security in systems powered by AI. Overall, robots can have a positive impact on society if their integration is carefully managed, but it’s crucial to address the potential negative effects to ensure they benefit everyone.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 11.0 [SEP] Prompt: Read the blog post. Then write about a city you visited. Type in the input box. Write 90-110 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: I recently visited Barcelona, Spain, and it was an unforgettable experience. The city is a perfect blend of modernity and history, with stunning architecture, like the Sagrada Familia and Park Güell, both designed by Antoni Gaudí. Walking through the narrow streets of the Gothic Quarter was like stepping back in time. The food was amazing too, with tapas and fresh seafood being local highlights. The beachside vibe of Barceloneta was relaxing, offering a nice contrast to the city's energetic pulse. Barcelona’s charm, rich culture, and vibrant atmosphere make it a must-visit destination for any traveler.
