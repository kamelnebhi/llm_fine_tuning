{"text": "Prompt Level: 3-Beginner [SEP] Prompt: Write a paragraph about a job your friend has or had in the past.

If you don‚Äôt know, you can invent this information. Type in the input box. Write 40-70 words. [SEP] Response: \n\n\nO ChatGPT disse:\nClaro! Aqui está um exemplo de um texto grande em inglês sobre um tema geral (o impacto da tecnologia na sociedade). Se você quiser sobre outro assunto, é só me avisar!\n\nThe Impact of Technology on Modern Society\n\nTechnology has become an inseparable part of modern life. From smartphones to artificial intelligence, the influence of technological advancements is evident in nearly every aspect of our daily routine. Over the past few decades, society has undergone rapid transformations driven by innovation, and these changes have brought both significant benefits and complex challenges.\n\nOne of the most notable impacts of technology is the way it has revolutionized communication. In the past, people relied on letters and landline phones to stay in touch. Today, social media platforms, video calls, and instant messaging apps allow individuals to communicate instantly across the globe. This global connectivity has made the world feel smaller and more interconnected, fostering cross-cultural understanding and collaboration.\n\nIn the field of education, technology has opened up new opportunities for learning. Online courses, digital textbooks, and virtual classrooms have made education more accessible than ever before. Students can now learn at their own pace, from virtually anywhere in the world. This has been particularly valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic, where remote learning became a necessity.\n\nHealthcare has also been transformed by technological progress. Modern medical equipment, electronic health records, and telemedicine services have improved the quality of patient care and made medical services more efficient. In addition, advancements in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals have contributed to longer life expectancies and the treatment of previously incurable diseases.\n\nHowever, the rise of technology is not without its downsides. Concerns about privacy, cybersecurity, and data misuse have become increasingly prominent. With more personal information being stored online, the risk of data breaches and identity theft has grown. Additionally, there are growing fears that automation and artificial intelligence may lead to widespread job displacement, particularly in industries reliant on repetitive tasks.\n\nMoreover, the pervasive use of digital devices has raised questions about mental health and social isolation. While technology connects us digitally, it can sometimes disconnect us from the physical world and the people around us. Excessive screen time and reliance on virtual interactions may contribute to feelings of loneliness and anxiety.\n\nIn conclusion, technology continues to shape the way we live, work, and interact. Its positive contributions to society are undeniable, offering greater convenience, efficiency, and connectivity. However, it is essential to address the challenges it poses with thoughtful policies and ethical considerations. By doing so, we can ensure that technological progress benefits everyone and creates a more equitable and sustainable future.", "task_id": "cfb893f1-bee1-4894-99f3-43af284493a5", "level_title": "3-Beginner", "label": 0}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Do you believe companies have a responsibility to society? Or do you think a company's only responsibility is to its shareholders? We invite you to join this discussion by posting your opinion on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!\nFor CSR\n\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 0}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The Garuda is a legendary creature deeply rooted in Indian mythology and is revered as a divine being in Hinduism. Described as a colossal, eagle-like bird with the body of a man, Garuda is the mount (vahana) of Lord Vishnu, one of the principal deities in Hinduism. Often depicted with a golden, radiant body, mighty wings, and an imposing beak, Garuda symbolizes power, speed, and martial prowess.\n\nIn various texts, Garuda is portrayed as a sworn enemy of serpents, embodying the eternal struggle between good and evil. This enmity is often attributed to his mission to free his mother from servitude by obtaining the nectar of immortality. Garuda's birth is itself a tale of divine intervention—hatched from a massive egg laid by his mother, Vinata, after a prolonged and arduous penance.\n\nGaruda's imagery is prevalent in Indian art and architecture, often seen adorning temples and sacred sites as a guardian figure. Beyond Hinduism, Garuda holds significance in Buddhist and Jain traditions, embodying virtues such as loyalty and bravery. His legacy transcends religious boundaries, making Garuda an enduring symbol of divine intervention and moral righteousness in Indian culture.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Language learning presents various challenges that can hinder progress for many students. One significant issue is the fear of speaking, which often stems from anxiety about making mistakes. How can learners overcome this fear? Creating a supportive environment where mistakes are viewed as learning opportunities can encourage more practice and confidence in speaking.\nAnother common challenge is the difficulty in retaining vocabulary and grammar rules. What strategies can help with memorization? Techniques such as spaced repetition, flashcards, and contextual learning can enhance retention and make the learning process more effective.\nAdditionally, many students struggle with finding the right resources and methods that suit their learning style. How can learners identify the best tools for their needs? Experimenting with various resources—such as language apps, online courses, and conversation groups—can help students discover what works best for them.\nLastly, maintaining motivation over time can be a hurdle. What can students do to stay engaged?

Motivating a team effectively is essential for long-term success. Here are some key strategies that can help you lead with confidence.\n\nFirst, build trust by being transparent and approachable. When employees feel heard and respected, they’re more likely to stay engaged. Set clear expectations and provide regular, constructive feedback. Recognize achievements both big and small — this shows your team their efforts are valued.\n\nOffer opportunities for growth, such as training or mentorship programs. People are more motivated when they see a future within the company. Also, promote a healthy work-life balance; a burned-out team is an unproductive one.\n\nNow, some strategies to avoid: never take credit for your team's work — always give credit where it’s due. Avoid micromanaging, as it kills creativity and confidence. Don’t ignore problems or complaints; doing so can lead to resentment. And finally, never let disrespect or unfair treatment go unaddressed.\n\nWith empathy, fairness, and strong communication, you’ll create a team that feels inspired and supported.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: CSR is a healthy business strategy for a workforce’ long-term sustainability, because it helps the business maximise profits in the long run while also forging these relationships with customers who are ultimately members of the community in which it operates. It results in low staff turnover and customer loyalty because, in true human nature, you tend to give a positive response when cared for. Although it may be seen a marketing device for most of whom do not benefit from it, it still does bring about real change to those whose lives are impacted by the good it does. Ensuring that the organisation considerably operates an eco-friendly business proves in one way responsibility to caring for the world and those who live in it. A business who gives back to the community in my opinions is much more recommendable than the one who don’t. A successful CSR project instils brand confidence in the customer’s minds to the extent it can be used as it’s competitive advantage proven not only on record but by having met all the community social expectations.

[SEP] Response: Learning a new language is an exciting journey, but it is also full of challenges. What are the most common difficulties that students face in this process? One of the main obstacles is a lack of confidence when speaking. Many students are afraid of making mistakes and, as a result, avoid communicating. How can we overcome this fear and create a more welcoming environment for practice? One solution could be group practice, where students feel more comfortable expressing themselves. Another challenge is the variety of vocabulary and grammar. How can we make learning more effective and less overwhelming? Using interactive apps and games can help to retain the content in a fun way. In addition, watching films or listening to music in the target language can enrich vocabulary in a natural way. Finally, motivation is crucial to maintaining interest over time. What strategies can we use to stay motivated? Setting realistic goals and celebrating small achievements can be a great way to stay focused. So while learning a new language can be challenging, with the right approaches and a supportive environment, it is possible to turn this journey into a rewarding and enriching experience.

[SEP] Response: Reading regularly is one of the most beneficial habits a person can develop. Not only does it enhance vocabulary and improve language skills, but it also stimulates mental faculties and nurtures creativity. When someone reads, they are exposed to new perspectives, cultures, and ideas, broadening their understanding of the world. Reading fiction, for example, fosters empathy by allowing readers to experience the emotions and struggles of characters very different from themselves. On the other hand, nonfiction books provide valuable knowledge and practical information that can be applied in daily life or professional contexts. Additionally, reading can be a powerful stress-reliever. Studies have shown that even a few minutes of reading can significantly reduce stress levels and promote relaxation. Whether it’s a novel, a biography, a scientific article, or even poetry, regular reading develops critical thinking, concentration, and emotional intelligence. In a world increasingly dominated by screens and fast content, making time to read deeply is more important than ever.", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 0}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Companies Have a Responsibility to Society\n\nIn today’s world, businesses have a powerful role that goes beyond generating profit. I strongly believe that companies have a responsibility to society, not just to their shareholders. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is no longer a luxury or a marketing tool—it’s a necessity.\n\nCompanies operate within communities, use natural resources, and benefit from public infrastructure and education. As such, they should give back to the very systems that support them. For example, tech companies can support digital education in underserved areas, while manufacturing firms can reduce emissions and ensure ethical labor practices. These actions not only create a positive impact but also build long-term trust with consumers.\n\nOpponents may argue that a company’s main duty is to its shareholders. However, ignoring social and environmental responsibilities can backfire. Negative publicity, boycotts, or legal action due to unethical practices can hurt a company’s reputation and profits. On the other hand, being socially responsible attracts customers, talent, and investors who care about values and sustainability.\n\nIn conclusion, companies should not operate in isolation from the society they benefit from. Social responsibility isn’t just good ethics—it’s good business. The world today needs organizations that care not only about what they produce but also about the impact they leave behind.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I believe that companies have a responsibility to society, not just to make money. Businesses are part of our communities. They use usually public roads, schools, and other services, so they should also give something back. For example, they can protect the environment, pay fair salaries, and support local projects.\n\nAlso, being socially responsible is good for business. When companies care about their workers, the planet, and the people around them, customers trust them more and in other hand the people could work good because it could give happiness to their families. This can help the company grow and earn more money in the long term. As Jack@MSU said: \"Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty.”\n\nSome people say that companies should only focus on making profits for their shareholders and I total agree with this statement, but I think it is not enough today. Many problems like pollution or inequality affect everyone. Governments can make laws, but companies also have power and resources to help. They should use that power in a good way.\n\nIn conclusion, companies are part of society, and they should act like responsible citizens.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning is an exciting but often challenging journey. Students face several common obstacles that can slow their progress or even discourage them. One major challenge is *lack of confidence*. Many learners fear making mistakes, which prevents them from practicing speaking and writing. However, mistakes are a natural part of learning and should be embraced as opportunities to improve.\n\nAnother difficulty is *limited exposure to the target language*. Students who do not regularly listen to native speakers or engage in conversations struggle to develop fluency. Immersion—through music, movies, and conversations—can help reinforce vocabulary and pronunciation.\n\nGrammar complexity can also be intimidating. Many languages have intricate rules that learners find confusing. Instead of memorizing endless rules, students can benefit from understanding patterns and practicing in real-life situations.\n\nFinally, *motivation and consistency* are crucial. Learning a language requires patience, and it is easy to lose motivation if progress feels slow. Setting achievable goals, using engaging resources, and celebrating small victories can keep students motivated.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

A true friend is someone who supports you, listens to you, and shares both happy and difficult moments with you. Without friends, life can feel lonely and less meaningful.\n\nFriendship teaches us empathy, patience, and trust. When we are with friends, we learn how to cooperate, communicate, and care for others. Good friends help us become better people. They encourage us to reach our goals and stand by us when we fail.\n\nIn today’s fast-paced world, it is easy to lose touch with friends. That is why it is important to make time for them and keep the connection strong. Whether through a simple message, a call, or spending time together, maintaining friendships requires effort.\n\nIn conclusion, friends are not just people we enjoy spending time with—they are essential to our emotional well-being.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most legendary creatures popular in Indian mythology is the Nāga. Nāgas are serpentine beings that are revered and feared across various Indian cultural and religious traditions, particularly in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. They are often depicted as half-human and half-cobra, possessing a human upper body and the lower body of a serpent.\n\nNāgas are considered to be powerful and possess a range of supernatural abilities. They are believed to reside in the underworld, known as Nāga-loka, which is a vast realm filled with treasures. They are also associated with bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, and seas, and are said to have control over rain and fertility.\n\nIn Hindu mythology, Nāgas are sometimes seen as protectors and are worshipped as water deities. They are known to guard treasures and are sometimes associated with hidden wisdom and esoteric knowledge. Ananta, also known as Shesha, is a prominent Nāga who serves as the bed upon which Lord Vishnu rests. Another well-known Nāga is Vasuki, who played a significant role in the churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthan) to obtain the nectar of immortality.\n\nNāgas can also be malevolent, known to bring disasters or misfortune to those who disrespect them or encroach upon their domains. As such, they are both revered and appeased through various rituals and offerings.\n\nIn Buddhist traditions, Nāgas are considered protectors of the Buddha and the Dharma. They are often depicted in Buddhist art and literature as beings who paid homage to the Buddha and were converted to his teachings.\n\nOverall, Nāgas are complex beings embodying dual aspects of benevolence and danger, deeply woven into the rich tapestry of Indian mythology and culture.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

A walk through the forest or a hike up a mountain provides more than just physical exercise – it refreshes the mind and nurtures the soul.\n\nIn today’s fast-paced world, it’s easy to forget how important it is to appreciate the simple things. Taking a moment to stop and admire the world around us can bring a sense of gratitude and perspective.

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning can be a rewarding yet challenging process. Many students face obstacles that hinder their progress, making the journey feel overwhelming at times. One common issue is **motivation**. Learning a new language requires consistent practice and effort, and without clear goals or reasons for learning, it's easy to lose enthusiasm.\n\nAnother challenge is **vocabulary retention**. Language students often struggle to remember and effectively use new words. It can be frustrating when you learn a word but forget it the next day, which slows down overall fluency. Additionally, **grammar** presents difficulties for many learners. Each language has its own set of rules and structures, and mastering these can be confusing, especially when they differ significantly from one's native tongue.\n\nPronunciation and **accent** are also frequent concerns. In languages with sounds that don’t exist in the learner's first language, producing these sounds correctly can feel nearly impossible.\n\nFinally, **cultural differences** can be another obstacle. Understanding the culture behind a language is key to truly mastering it, but this often requires exposure to the language in real-world contexts, which is not always feasible.\n\nDespite these challenges, language learning can be a rewarding experience with the right mindset, patience, and strategies.\n", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language is a rewarding yet challenging endeavor. Many students face various obstacles during their language-learning journey. One common challenge is motivation. Maintaining consistent effort can be difficult, especially when progress feels slow or when students feel overwhelmed by the complexity of grammar and vocabulary. To combat this, it’s essential to set small, achievable goals and celebrate milestones along the way.\n\nAnother issue is lack of practice opportunities. While students can learn grammar rules and vocabulary, applying them in real conversations is crucial for fluency. In areas where the language isn’t widely spoken, finding people to converse with can be a struggle. Language exchange platforms, language meetups, or speaking with native speakers online can provide valuable practice.\n\nAdditionally, pronunciation and accent often pose difficulties. It can be intimidating for students to speak out loud, especially when they feel their accent is not quite right. Overcoming this fear requires building confidence through consistent practice and seeking constructive feedback.\n\nFinally, language interference—where the student's first language affects how they learn or use the new language—can cause confusion. For instance, sentence structure or false cognates can lead to mistakes. To address this, students should immerse themselves in the language and practice regularly, as repetition helps solidify correct patterns.\n\nBy recognizing and addressing these challenges, students can improve their language skills more effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Or do you think a company's only responsibility is to its shareholders? We invite you to join this discussion by posting your opinion on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nFor CSR\n\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 0}

Write 50-75 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: The Journey of a Dreamer\n\nIt was a bright and chilly morning when Jack stood by the window, gazing out at the sprawling city. The world seemed so vast and full of opportunities, yet he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing. For years, he had followed the path laid out for him: finish school, get a stable job, and live a comfortable life. But inside, Jack always felt like there was more to life than just playing it safe.\n\nEvery day, he passed by the same familiar streets, and yet he couldn't help but wonder what lay beyond them. He had dreams—big dreams—but they always seemed out of reach. His heart longed for adventure, for the kind of freedom that comes with stepping into the unknown. Jack knew he had to make a choice: continue living a life of routine or take a leap of faith and pursue the dream that had always burned within him.\n\nOne afternoon, Jack made the decision. He packed his things, said goodbye to his old job, and boarded a flight to a faraway land. It wasn’t the easiest decision he had ever made. There were doubts, fears, and endless what-ifs running through his mind. But deep down, he knew that this was the only way to truly live.\n\nHis first stop was a small coastal village in Portugal. The moment Jack arrived, the scent of the sea and the sound of crashing waves immediately put him at ease. He felt like he was in the right place. In the city, he had been just another face in the crowd, but here, he was a stranger in a new world, and that felt both humbling and exciting.\n\nJack spent his days exploring the narrow, cobblestone streets, meeting new people, and learning about the culture. He discovered that life in the village was simple but beautiful. The locals were warm and welcoming, always eager to share their stories. Every evening, Jack would sit at a local café, sipping coffee as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the sea. It was in these moments that he felt alive, truly alive in a way he hadn’t in years.\n\nAs the weeks passed, Jack began to understand something important: his dreams were not about grand accomplishments or fame. They were about living authentically, experiencing life without the constraints of fear or societal expectations. In the village, he found not only peace but also clarity.\n\nOne evening, as Jack walked along the beach, he met an old fisherman named Miguel. The man had a weathered face and hands rough from years of work, but his eyes were kind and full of wisdom. They struck up a conversation, and soon, Jack found himself listening to Miguel’s life story. The fisherman had spent most of his years out on the sea, learning the ways of the ocean, the winds, and the tides. But it wasn’t just the sea that taught Miguel lessons. It was the quiet moments, the long hours of solitude, and the simplicity of life that had given him the most valuable lessons.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" Miguel said, \"we think that we have to follow a certain path. We believe that the future is something we can control. But in reality, life has a way of guiding us where we need to go, even when we don’t know it ourselves.\"\n\nJack thought about this for a long time. It wasn’t about having everything figured out. It was about trusting the journey and embracing the unknown. Over the next few months, Jack learned to let go of the need for control. He stopped worrying about what he should be doing or where he was supposed to be. Instead, he followed his heart, trusting that the right opportunities would come at the right time.\n\nBy the time Jack returned to the city, he was a changed man. He no longer felt the pressure to live up to other people’s expectations. He had realized that the greatest adventure of all was the journey of self-discovery. Jack began to pursue his passions—photography, writing, and traveling—and soon found that the world had more to offer than he had ever imagined.\n\nIn the end, Jack’s journey wasn’t just about the places he visited or the people he met. It was about the person he became along the way. He had learned to embrace uncertainty, to trust in the beauty of the unknown, and to live with purpose. And that, he realized, was the greatest dream of all.\n", "task_id": "d040caa5-7bd8-412c-aee2-3d9010b91821", "level_title": "12-Upper Intermediate", "label": 0}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: My Opinion on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\n\nI strongly believe that companies do have a responsibility towards society. While it is true that businesses exist to make profits, ignoring their social impact can lead to long-term negative consequences for both the community and the company itself.\n\nFirst of all, companies operate within communities that provide them with workers, customers, and infrastructure. It is only fair that they give something back. Initiatives like offering fair wages, investing in environmental sustainability, and supporting local development are ways to build trust and long-term success.\n\nMoreover, CSR makes good business sense. As Jack@MSU pointed out, customers today care about social and environmental issues. Companies with a strong CSR image often enjoy higher customer loyalty and positive brand reputation. This can directly impact their financial performance.\n\nOn the other hand, I understand the argument that a company’s main goal is profit and that the government should enforce social welfare policies. However, I believe CSR is not about replacing government responsibilities but complementing them. Companies have the resources and influence to make a difference.\n\nIn conclusion, companies should go beyond simply maximizing profits. By adopting CSR practices, they not only help society but also create a sustainable environment for their own growth.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

Coming from the traditions of Mexico and Central America, El Nahual is both feared and admired.\n\nEl Nahual is thought to be a shaman or witch who can change into animals like jaguars, coyotes, or owls. This shape-shifting power, called nagualism, lets El Nahual move between the spiritual and physical worlds with incredible strength. These transformations are often said to happen during the night, especially under the moonlight.\n\nEl Nahual is seen as a nature protector and keeper of sacred knowledge. Some say El Nahual helps the community by healing and safeguarding them, while others believe it can be a scary figure that spreads fear and curses.\n\nEl Nahual’s legend continues to intrigue people, keeping the rich culture and magical tales of Mesoamerican folklore alive.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response:  Motivating your team is essential for creating a positive, productive, and engaging work environment. When your team feels motivated, they are more likely to perform at their best, stay committed, and contribute to the overall success of your organization. Here are some friendly and practical tips to help you motivate your team effectively:\n\nEncourage Open Communication\nCreate an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their ideas, concerns, and feedback. Listen actively and show genuine interest in what they have to say. This builds trust and makes them feel valued.\n\nRecognize and Celebrate Achievements\nAcknowledge individual and team accomplishments regularly. Simple gestures like saying “good job” or giving small rewards can boost morale and motivate everyone to keep striving for excellence.\n\nSet Clear Goals and Expectations\nHelp your team understand what is expected of them. Clear goals give direction and purpose, making it easier for team members to stay focused and motivated.\n\nProvide Opportunities for Growth\nOffer training, workshops, or new responsibilities that allow team members to develop their skills. When people see opportunities for personal and professional growth, they tend to be more engaged.\n\nFoster a Positive Work Environment\nCreate a space where positivity, respect, and collaboration thrive. Encourage teamwork and support among colleagues. A friendly atmosphere makes work more enjoyable.\n\nOffer Autonomy and Trust\nAllow team members to take ownership of their tasks. Trusting them to make decisions shows confidence in their abilities and motivates them to perform well.\n\nBe Supportive and Approachable\nShow empathy and be available to help when needed. When team members know they can rely on you, they feel more secure and motivated.\n\nProvide Constructive Feedback\nOffer feedback that is specific, helpful, and encouraging. Focus on solutions and improvements rather than just pointing out mistakes.\n\nCreate a Sense of Purpose\nHelp your team see how their work contributes to larger goals or the company's mission. Feeling that their work makes a difference can be highly motivating.\n\nEncourage Work-Life Balance\nRespect personal time and promote a healthy balance between work and personal life. Happy, rested employees are more productive and motivated.\n\nMaintain Fairness and Transparency\nBe honest and fair in your dealings. Transparency about decisions and processes builds trust and loyalty.\n\nLead by Example\nDemonstrate enthusiasm, dedication, and a positive attitude. Your behavior sets the tone for the team.\n\nCreate Opportunities for Social Interaction\nOrganize team-building activities or informal gatherings. Building strong relationships fosters a sense of belonging and motivation.\n\nSet Realistic and Achievable Goals\nAvoid setting unattainable targets. Achievable goals help maintain motivation and prevent frustration.\n\nEncourage Innovation and Creativity\nAllow team members to suggest new ideas and approaches. Feeling that their input matters motivates them to be more engaged.\n\nProvide Adequate Resources and Support\nEnsure your team has the tools and support needed to do their jobs effectively. Frustration from lack of resources can diminish motivation.\n\nCelebrate Milestones and Successes\nMark important achievements with celebrations or acknowledgments. Recognizing progress keeps momentum going.\n\nBe Patient and Understanding\nEveryone has good days and bad days. Show patience and understanding, especially during challenging times.\n\nMaintain a Friendly and Respectful Attitude\nTreat everyone with kindness and respect. A friendly environment encourages motivation and loyalty.\n\nAvoid Negative Behaviors\nRefrain from disrespect, blaming others, or losing your temper.

Employees have reported discomfort when mixed with staff from other branches during sessions, and the program has seen low usage in other locations. These factors may impact overall engagement and learning outcomes.\n\nOn the other hand, Skills Pro, while more expensive, has demonstrated higher quality in both course content and results. Although some participants initially find the content challenging, most complete the course successfully. Furthermore, Skills Pro is planning to expand its course offerings, which could provide additional value to our company in the future.\n\nConsidering the importance of effective training and long-term results, Skills Pro is the best choice.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 15-Advanced [SEP] Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response:  Language learning can be both rewarding and challenging. Students often face several common issues during the process. One major challenge is maintaining motivation. At the beginning, learners are usually excited, but as grammar rules get more complex and progress slows, motivation can decrease. Another common problem is the fear of making mistakes. Many students hesitate to speak because they’re afraid of being judged or embarrassed, which limits their opportunities to practice and improve.rrr\n\nHow do learners stay engaged when progress feels slow? One solution is to set small, realistic goals. Celebrating small victories—like learning 10 new words or understanding a short video—can keep motivation high. Also, learners can try to make studying fun by watching shows, listening to music, or chatting with native speakers.\n\nAnother question is: how can students get past the fear of speaking? Practicing in a safe, supportive environment is important. Speaking with other learners or using language learning apps that offer corrections without criticism can help build confidence.\n\nFinally, a lack of immersion is a challenge. When students don’t have regular exposure to the language, progress is slower. To solve this, learners can try to include the language in their daily routine, like labeling household items or thinking in the target language.\n\nIn conclusion, language learning takes time, patience, and creativity, but with the right mindset and strategies, students can overcome these obs", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 5}

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Harry,\n\nThese tips are a great foundation for becoming a strong and respected leader. Motivating employees isn’t just about offering rewards—it’s about creating a positive, supportive work environment where people feel valued and heard. When you show genuine interest in your employees’ growth and well-being, they’re more likely to stay engaged and perform at their best. Encouraging a healthy work-life balance, providing training opportunities, and acting as a mentor helps employees feel that they matter beyond just their job title.\n\nListening is another key element. Even when employees have complaints, just knowing their voice matters can boost morale and trust. Always treat others the way you’d want to be treated—this builds mutual respect and loyalty.\n\nAt the same time, avoiding demotivators is just as important. Nothing destroys team spirit faster than disrespect, taking credit unfairly, or losing your temper. Praise good work often—it costs nothing but means a lot.\n\nWishing you great success with your team!", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}

A true friend is someone who supports you, listens to you, and shares both happy and difficult moments with you. Without friends, life can feel lonely and less meaningful.\n\nFriendship teaches us empathy, patience, and trust. When we are with friends, we learn how to cooperate, communicate, and care for others. Good friends help us become better people. They encourage us to reach our goals and stand by us when we fail.\n\nIn today’s fast-paced world, it is easy to lose touch with friends. That is why it is important to make time for them and keep the connection strong. Whether through a simple message, a call, or spending time together, maintaining friendships requires effort.\n\nIn conclusion, friends are not just people we enjoy spending time with—they are essential to our emotional well-being.

Gratitude grows in that stillness. And from gratitude comes joy—not the fleeting joy of achievement, but the lasting joy of being.

I'm glad you reached out to me.\n\nRegarding work, it might help to try and have a conversation with your manager or HR about the lack of acknowledgment and motivation. Sometimes, management isn't aware of how their actions impact the team, and bringing it to their attention could lead to some positive changes. If that doesn't help, it might be worth considering other opportunities where you feel more valued.\n\nAs for your situation with Tia, relationships can be tough, especially when things aren't going as hoped. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with her about how you're both feeling and see if there's a way to work through the issues together. If not, remember that it's okay to take time for yourself and focus on healing.\n\nI'm always here to listen and offer support, so don't hesitate to reach out whenever you need to talk. You've got a great strength in handling tough situations, and I'm confident you'll find your way through this.\n\nTake care of yourself.\n\nBest,\nSid", "task_id": "9032f3ed-5da1-4efe-b4dd-c9470bb35d65", "level_title": "16-Upper Advanced", "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: After reviewing both training companies – TrainQuick and Skills Pro – I recommend we proceed with Skills Pro.\n\nWhile TrainQuick is more affordable and offers flexibility, it has not been widely adopted in our other branch. One major concern is that employees have expressed dissatisfaction when their classes include participants from different branches. This has led to a lack of engagement and lower participation rates.\n\nOn the other hand, Skills Pro, although more expensive, provides higher-quality training. Some employees found the course content challenging, but those who completed it reported a strong sense of achievement and improved skills. This suggests that the program is both demanding and effective. Moreover, the company plans to expand its course offerings, which demonstrates growth and adaptability to future needs.\n\nIn conclusion, although the cost of Skills Pro is higher, the benefits in terms of quality, employee satisfaction, and potential for long-term development make it the better choice.

[SEP] Response: Report on recommendation for Training Provider\n\nAfter evaluating two training providers, TrainQuick and Skills Pro, I recommend selecting Skills Pro for future staff development.\n\nTrainQuick offers affordable and flexible training; however, its usage is low, particularly in our other branches. Feedback indicates that employees are dissatisfied with being placed in mixed-branch classes, which can reduce engagement and hinder collaboration.\n\nIn contrast, while Skills Pro is more expensive, its programs are known for higher quality. Although the course content is considered challenging, most participants successfully complete it. This demonstrates that the training is both effective and well-structured. Moreover, Skills Pro is planning to expand its offerings, which could provide additional opportunities for staff development in the future.\n\nGiven the importance of impactful and consistent training, Skills Pro stands out as the better option. Despite the higher cost, the provider’s success rate, strong course content, and potential for growth justify the investment. High-quality training ultimately benefits both individual employees and the organization as a whole.\n\nRecommendation: Proceed with Skills Pro as our preferred training provider.", "task_id": "28757296-8797-428f-a562-0b03c304b341", "level_title": "14-Advanced", "label": 5}

On his way, Jack met a mysterious man who offered him five magic beans in exchange for the cow. Jack agreed, believing the beans were worth more than the cow.\n\nWhen Jack returned home, his mother was furious and threw the beans out of the window. That night, the beans grew into an enormous beanstalk, reaching high into the sky, beyond the clouds. The next morning, Jack decided to climb the beanstalk to see where it led.\n\nAt the top, Jack found a giant's castle. The giant was fierce, but Jack managed to sneak inside and discover that the giant owned treasures, including a golden goose that laid golden eggs. Jack stole the goose and ran back down the beanstalk. The giant chased him, but Jack was quick and chopped down the beanstalk, causing the giant to fall to the ground and disappear forever.\n\nWith the golden goose, Jack and his mother became rich, and they never had to worry about food or money again. Jack had learned that bravery and cleverness could lead to great rewards.\n\n", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "level_title": "15-Advanced", "label": 0}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: My Opinion on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\n \nI believe companies do have a responsibility to society, beyond just generating profits for their shareholders. While it is true that a company must be financially successful to survive, long-term success increasingly depends on how businesses interact with the communities and environments they operate in.\n \nFirst, consumers today are more aware and socially conscious. They often choose to support companies that demonstrate ethical behavior, care for the environment, and treat their workers fairly. This is not only a moral argument but also a practical one: good CSR builds trust, strengthens brand reputation, and encourages customer loyalty. For example, a company that invests in sustainable practices or community education programs is more likely to be viewed positively, which ultimately contributes to its profitability.\n \nSecondly, corporations are a part of society and benefit from the infrastructure, labor force, and natural resources provided by it. Giving back is not just charity—it’s about maintaining the ecosystem that supports their existence. Neglecting social responsibilities may lead to public backlash, government intervention, or even employee dissatisfaction.\n \nOf course, CSR should not replace government action, but it can complement it. When businesses and governments work together, they can address societal challenges more effectively.\n \nIn conclusion, corporate social responsibility is not a burden but an opportunity—for ethical growth, brand loyalty, and long-term stability.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "level_title": "13-Advanced", "label": 5}
