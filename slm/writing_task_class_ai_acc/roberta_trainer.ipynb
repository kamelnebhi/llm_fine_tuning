I loved walking along the Seine River and seeing the Eiffel Tower sparkle at night. I spent hours at the Louvre, where I admired the Mona Lisa and many other masterpieces. Montmartre was another highlight—its artistic vibe and the view from the Sacré-Cœur were stunning. I also enjoyed tasting French cuisine, especially croissants and macarons. Paris is a magical city that combines beauty, culture, and charm.
