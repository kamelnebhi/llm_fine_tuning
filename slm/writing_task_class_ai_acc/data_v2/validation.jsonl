{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: For me the most pracical techniques for creative writing are metaphors and listings. In the past I used both techniques, but in diffrent situations. \nMetaphors are for me more usefull in a verbal conversation or while I have to explain something to somebody. So I am able to connect new informations with common knowledge or knowledge the person allready got. For example in my actual position as teammanager I have to manage resources. If you have limited resources for a given workload, you will have to shift the resources from side to side. A good metaphor for this situation is a table with a tablecloth, which is to small. \nListings are very usefull for writing scientific papers. I allways start with a list of topics I have to adress in the paper. Sometime this list could be used later as an draft for the index of the paper.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, metaphor and symbolism stand out as particularly useful. Metaphors allow writers to convey complex ideas more vividly by making direct comparisons that spark imagination in readers. For instance, describing a challenging experience as \"climbing a steep mountain\" evokes not only the struggle but also a sense of achievement at the summit. This technique enhances emotional resonance in writing.\n\nSymbolism, on the other hand, adds depth by allowing objects, characters, or events to represent larger ideas. A recurring symbol can unify a narrative and provide layers of meaning, inviting readers to engage more profoundly with the text.\n\nAdditionally, focused free writing serves as a valuable tool for overcoming writer's block. By allowing thoughts to flow freely without judgment, one can uncover hidden ideas or themes that may lead to more polished writing later on. Overall, these techniques provide powerful avenues for expression and creativity, enabling writers to connect with readers on a deeper level while effectively communicating their message.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Metaphor and free writing are two distinct yet potentially complementary concepts in the realm of creative expression. A metaphor is a figure of speech that involves an implicit comparison between two unlike things, allowing for a deeper understanding or new perspective by highlighting similarities. For example, saying \"time is a thief\" evokes the idea of time stealthily taking away life's moments, enriching the narrative beyond literal language. On the other hand, free writing is an unstructured, spontaneous form of writing where the writer allows words to flow without concern for grammar, structure, or coherence. This method is often used to overcome writer's block, explore thoughts, or tap into subconscious ideas, encouraging creativity and self-expression. When combined, metaphors introduced during free writing sessions can lead to surprising and insightful connections, as the lack of constraints fosters innovation in thought and language. Together, they provide a powerful toolkit for writers seeking to explore the depths of their imagination and convey complex emotions or concepts with clarity and impact.

Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a trade pact between the United States, Canada, and Mexico that came into force in January 1994 after years of negotiation1. NAFTA aimed to reduce or eliminate customs duties among the member states, significantly impacting trade relations, particularly in agriculture. For instance, Mexican fruits and vegetables now flow freely into the US2. While NAFTA has had both positive and negative impacts on its members, it has generally benefited all three countries by fostering economic growth and enhancing trade opportunities3. Despite some controversies, the agreement has played a crucial role in shaping the economic landscape of North America.\n Most economic analyses indicate that NAFTA was beneficial to the North American economies and the average citizen, although it harmed a small minority of workers in industries exposed to trade competition.\n The agreement also includes chapters covering rules of origin, customs procedures, agriculture and sanitary measures, government procurement, investment, trade in services, protection of intellectual property rights, and dispute settlement procedures Correction: <input>The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a trade pact between the United States, Canada, and Mexico that came into force in January 1994 after years of <code a=\"NOUN\" c=\"negotiation\">negotiation1</code>.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Cubing and loop writing are both creative techniques used in the fields of writing and thinking to organize and develop ideas.\nCubing is a method inspired by the idea of looking at an object from all six sides. In writing, it involves exploring a topic from six different perspectives to gain a more comprehensive understanding. These perspectives include describing, comparing, associating, analyzing, applying, and arguing. For example, when writing about a historical event, a writer might first describe the event, then compare it to similar events, analyze its causes and effects, and argue its significance. Cubing helps expand ideas and allows for a more multidimensional approach to a topic, fostering deeper thinking and more nuanced writing.\nLoop writing is a technique in which a writer continually refines and revises their work through repeated drafts. In loop writing, a writer begins with a basic idea or rough draft and then revises it in loops, each time deepening the focus or expanding on specific details. The process can help clarify ideas, improve structure, and strengthen arguments. It's particularly effective for exploring new concepts, allowing writers to see connections between thoughts that may not have been apparent in the initial draft.\nBoth cubing and loop writing encourage flexible, iterative thinking, offering structured ways to enhance creativity and thoughtfulness in writing.\n Correction: <input><code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"In\">Cubing and loop writing are both creative techniques used in</code> the <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"preceding units, nine\">fields of</code> writing <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"techniques were introduced\">and thinking to organize and develop ideas.\nCubing is a method inspired by </code><code a=\"PHRA\" c=\":\">the</code> <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"metaphor\">idea of looking at </code><code a=\"PHRA\" c=\",\">an</code> <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"hyperbole,\">object from all six</code> <code a=\"NOUN\" c=\"symbolism\">sides</code><code a=\"PUNCT\" c=\",\">.</code> <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"free\">In</code> writing, <code a=\"PRON\" c=\"\">it </code><code a=\"VERB\" c=\"focused\">involves exploring</code> <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"free writing\">a topic from six different perspectives to gain a more comprehensive understanding.

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: In my country, robots are increasingly being used in various sectors, especially in manufacturing, healthcare, and customer service. In factories, robots assist in assembling products with precision and speed, reducing human error and increasing productivity. In hospitals, robotic surgical systems help doctors perform delicate procedures with greater accuracy, while service robots in banks, malls, and airports assist customers with basic tasks and information. I feel both impressed and cautious about this growing presence of robots. On the one hand, they can improve efficiency, safety, and convenience in our daily lives. On the other hand, I worry about the potential loss of jobs and overdependence on machines. As robots take on more roles, society may benefit from reduced labor costs and improved quality of services, but this shift could also widen economic inequality and lead to social challenges. Overall, robots can bring positive change if used responsibly, with proper policies to protect workers and ensure ethical use of technology.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: I strongly believe that companies have a responsibility to society beyond just making profits for shareholders. Businesses do not operate in a vacuum—they rely on communities for labor, infrastructure, and customers. Therefore, it’s only fair that they give back in meaningful ways.\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is not just about charity; it’s about sustainable and ethical business practices. When companies invest in their communities, support education, reduce environmental harm, and treat employees fairly, they create a positive cycle. For example, offering fair wages and safe working conditions leads to happier employees, which in turn boosts productivity and reduces turnover. Similarly, supporting local education helps build a skilled future workforce, which benefits the company in the long run.\n\nCritics argue that CSR is just a marketing tool or that it distracts from profit-making. But I see it as a win-win. Consumers today are more socially conscious and prefer to support brands that align with their values. So, CSR can actually enhance a company’s reputation and profitability.\n\nIn conclusion, CSR should be an integral part of every company’s operations. It’s not just good ethics—it’s good business.

Humans are wired to be in awe of the alpha species since long. However, the definition of celebrity has certainly changed over the years.

Write 150-200 words. Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which came into effect on January 1, 1994, was a landmark trade deal between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Its primary goal was to eliminate or reduce barriers to trade, such as tariffs, and to create a more integrated North American economy. Over time, NAFTA significantly boosted trade in goods like agricultural products, with Mexican fruits and vegetables, for example, flowing more freely into the U.S. economy. While the agreement brought many benefits, including increased exports and job creation in some sectors, it also had its downsides. Critics argued that NAFTA led to job losses in certain U.S. industries, such as manufacturing, as companies moved operations to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs. Despite these challenges, overall, NAFTA was seen as beneficial to all three countries by increasing trade, fostering economic growth, and encouraging investment across the region.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: An airplane has many important parts that help it fly safely and efficiently. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane. It holds the passengers, cargo, and the cockpit where the pilots sit. The fuselage is strong and shaped to reduce air resistance.\nThe wings are attached to the fuselage and are very important for flying. They create lift, which helps the airplane rise into the air. Wings also have flaps and ailerons that help the pilot control the plane’s movement during takeoff, flight, and landing.\nThe tail of the airplane includes the vertical and horizontal stabilizers. These parts keep the airplane stable and help control its direction. The vertical stabilizer helps the airplane turn left or right, while the horizontal stabilizer controls the up and down movement.\nFinally, the engines provide the power needed for the airplane to move forward. They push or pull the plane through the air and help it gain speed for takeoff and maintain speed during flight.\nAll these parts work together to make flying possible and safe.

Response: The Fuselage or Body includes the Cockpit, the Cargo section, also the Cabin, which is the place the passengers and crew members occupy during the flight. The engines placed lower in both sides of the plane are equipped with pistons. The Wings are extensions of the fuselage of the Airplane, and they incorporate ailerons. The ailerons with their movement allow the plane to increase or decrease airplane vertical speed. The Flaps, on the inner wing trailing edge, they increase lift during takeoff or landing. The Slats, on the leading edge of wings, help generate more lift at slower speeds. The tail section contains the Fin, which provides directional stability. Also, in the tail section we find the Horizontal Stabilizer, which maintains pitch stability, the Elevator, that controls pitch, and the Rudder, attached to vertical stabilizer, controls yaw.

Response: Getting a home loan and home are time taking processes in my country. Home is a place that should be able to meet our requirements, like budget, comfort, near to local amenities like public transportation, gyms, prayer places, school and colleges, workplace etc.  Home loan on the other hand can also be a tedious task as it has to undergo a lot of formal processes and it is based on the mortgage power, and the income of the person who applies it. A proper research and clear idea about the money you are going to invest in your home should be a thought on a serious thought. We need to consider if we are able to afford a home that we require. The budget of the home should not drain all the savings and all your savings should not be working just for your home. You will have to pay your home loan monthly debt, meet your daily expense, and need to save for your future. So choosing the right budget for your home is a tie breaker.

Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find **focused free writing**, **listing**, and **questioning** to be the most useful for my writing process. Focused free writing helps me develop ideas around a specific topic without worrying about structure or grammar, allowing creativity to flow while still staying on track. It’s especially helpful when I’m trying to explore a theme or prepare a rough draft. Listing is also incredibly effective—it helps me organize thoughts, break down complex topics, and create a clear plan before I start writing. I often use it to brainstorm supporting points or examples. Questioning is useful when I’m stuck or need to look at a topic from different perspectives; asking who, what, when, where, why, and how can lead to deeper thinking and uncover new angles I hadn’t considered. While techniques like metaphor and symbolism are great for creative or descriptive writing, I rely more on practical tools that help me structure and expand my ideas effectively.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: Buying a home in the United States is a significant financial decision that involves multiple steps and considerations. The process can be both exciting and challenging, depending on various factors such as location, market conditions, and individual financial circumstances.\n\nFirstly, housing prices vary widely across the country, with metropolitan areas like New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles being particularly expensive. Conversely, regions in the Midwest and South often offer more affordable options. As of 2023, the median home price in the U.S. is around $400,000, but this can fluctuate based on the local market.\n\nApplying for a home loan typically involves a detailed process with several forms and documentation requirements. Prospective buyers must provide proof of income, credit history, employment verification, and details about any existing debts. Lenders use this information to assess creditworthiness and determine loan eligibility. Interest rates for mortgages can vary, influenced by the Federal Reserve's policies and economic conditions. As of late 2023, average interest rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage hover around 6-7%, though this can change.\n\nUsing a real estate agent is advisable for navigating the complex home-buying process and for access to market insights and negotiation expertise. A mortgage broker can also be helpful in finding suitable loan options tailored to individual needs. However, handling the process independently is possible for those who prefer a more hands-on approach and have prior experience.\n\nOverall, while buying a home involves considerable paperwork and financial scrutiny, preparation and professional assistance can simplify the process.

Response: I bought a house with my boyfriend last year. As exciting as it sounds and as it was, dealing with the bank was the closest thing to a nightmare I’ve ever experienced. First, we went there to talk to the banker about our budget and made sure that we were looking for houses we could afford. We made financial plans long before to make sure everything was in order. My boyfriend works as a financial controller, so I had the best advisor. Everything was going according to plan. We gave the bank bills, loans, work contracts, salaries... and when everything was clear, we signed for a house. We gave 10,000 euros and marked a day in our calendars to go and see the notary. Only two weeks before the closing, the banker called us. There was a \"mistake\" in the contract, and the solution came in a three-minute call. He called me and wanted us to pay more, have worse conditions, such as a higher interest rate, and four mandatory guarantors. I almost couldn’t believe it. Thanks to our contacts— as we say in Spain, \"como los padrinos van a las bodas\" (like godfathers go to weddings)— we were able to redo all the four months of work in a week and a half with another bank, allowing us to sign and not lose the house or the money. Next time we buy anything, I’ll make sure we have all the money in our pockets. I no longer trust banks.\n Correction: <input>I bought a house with my boyfriend last year.

This is through no fault of their own, but a small business is unlikely to have hundreds of thousands of pounds sitting in the bank as a ready resource for things such as rent, utilities, wages and investment in marketing and new processes.\n\nGetting paid can prove to be problematic, as larger companies may put you on 90 day payment terms; small companies, on the other hand, may have their own cash flow worries, therefore delaying payment as much as possible.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in Italy can be a complex process, especially for first-time buyers. The first step is usually to find a suitable property, often with the help of a real estate agent. In most cases, people prefer to use an agent because they can guide buyers through the legal and bureaucratic steps, which can be overwhelming.\n\nOnce a property is chosen, the next step is applying for a mortgage. This involves preparing a lot of paperwork, including proof of income, bank statements, tax returns, and identification documents. Banks in Italy are very strict about checking the financial stability of applicants. Generally, the bank will only approve a loan if the monthly payment does not exceed 30-35% of the borrower’s income.\n\nInterest rates can vary depending on the type of loan. Fixed rates are more stable but usually slightly higher, while variable rates can be lower at first but may increase over time. As of 2024, average interest rates for mortgages in Italy are around 3-4%.\n\nOverall, housing in Italy can be expensive, especially in major cities like Milan and Rome. However, the government offers some incentives for young people and first-time buyers, which can help make the process more accessible.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: In my country, Brazil, buying a home and applying for a home loan can be a challenging and time-consuming process. First, property prices in major cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are quite high, especially in central or well-developed neighborhoods. For many people, buying a house without a loan is almost impossible, so most rely on financing options offered by banks or government programs like “Minha Casa, Minha Vida.”\n\nThe process of applying for a home loan usually involves a lot of paperwork. Applicants must provide proof of income, employment history, tax returns, identification documents, and sometimes even a credit history report. The bank will carefully evaluate the borrower’s financial situation before approving the loan.\n\nInterest rates in Brazil tend to be higher than in some other countries. They usually range from 8% to 12% per year, depending on the applicant’s profile, the chosen bank, and the loan term. Recently, government incentives and lower Selic rates have slightly reduced mortgage rates, but they are still considered expensive.\n\nUsing a real estate agent is not required, but many people choose to work with one to help find suitable properties and negotiate with sellers. Some also use mortgage brokers to assist with the loan process. Overall, buying a home in Brazil requires patience, financial planning, and good organization to handle all the required steps and documents.

For many people, buying a house without a loan is almost impossible, so most rely on financing options offered by banks or government programs like “Minha Casa, Minha Vida.”\n\nThe process of applying for a home loan usually involves a lot of paperwork. Applicants must provide proof of income, employment history, tax returns, identification documents, and sometimes even a credit history report. The bank will carefully evaluate the borrower’s financial situation before approving the loan.\n\nInterest rates in Brazil tend to be higher than in some other countries. They usually range from 8% to 12% per year, depending on the applicant’s profile, the chosen bank, and the loan term. Recently, government incentives and lower Selic rates have slightly reduced mortgage rates, but they are still considered expensive.\n\nUsing a real estate agent is not required, but many people choose to work with one to help find suitable properties and negotiate with sellers. Some also use mortgage brokers to assist with the loan process. Overall, buying a home in Brazil requires patience, financial planning, and good organization to handle all the required steps and documents.</input>", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The writing techniques that I find most useful are free writing, listing, and questioning. Free writing helps me get my thoughts on paper without worrying about structure or grammar. It allows me to express my ideas freely, and it often leads to unexpected insights. Once I have the raw material from free writing, I can refine and organize it later. Listing is also very helpful, especially when I need to brainstorm or break down a complex topic. It helps me see all the elements of a subject clearly and find connections between them. Questioning is another technique that I use often. By asking myself questions about a topic, I can explore it from different angles and deepen my understanding. These techniques work well for me because they encourage creativity, help organize my thoughts, and lead to clearer, more developed writing. They also make the writing process feel less intimidating, allowing me to focus more on ideas than on perfection.

Response: The terrifying chupacabra is a modern myth very much alive in the Americas. Thanks largely to television and the Internet, stories about the chupacabra and other modern mythic creatures spread quickly between communities, countries and even continents. And as mythic creatures take root in new settings, they often change to suit their new audiences. In some places, the chupacabra is a mysterious predator lurking in the forest; in others, it is a sensational, sometimes tongue-in-cheek, media creation. People tell of the chupacabra's glowing red eyes and glistening fangs, and of how the beast lurks in the forest, preying on goats and cattle, terrifying local residents. Chupacabra means \"goat sucker\" in Spanish, and according to reports, the creature acts much like a vampire, killing animals by sucking their blood. Though similar stories date back several decades, the first major wave of alleged chupacabra sightings came from farmers in Puerto Rico in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Today people across much of Latin America and the southwestern United States tell tales of the chupacabra. The fanged creature can also be spotted on T-shirts, coffee mugs and other souvenir items.

Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: Buying a house in Brazil is a dream for many people, but the process can be challenging. Property prices vary a lot depending on the region. In major cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, prices are usually high, making financing a common option for those who cannot pay upfront.\n\nTo get a home loan, good financial planning is essential. Banks require various documents, such as proof of income, tax returns, and bank statements. Additionally, a down payment of around 20% of the property's value is typically needed. Interest rates in Brazil are not low—often exceeding 10% annually—and this significantly impacts the total cost.\n\nThe process involves a lot of bureaucracy. There are many forms to fill out and steps to complete, such as credit analysis and property evaluation by the bank. Working with a real estate agent can be very helpful.

Have a look at your checklist, then write him an email advising him of the changes he has to make. Write 150-200 words. Response: Property and Liability Insurance Assessment \nFalling Bricks:\nThe primary hazard is the potential for loose bricks to fall, causing injury to people or damage to property.\nPotential for Falling Objects:\nOther falling objects, like debris from mortar or other materials associated with loose bricks, should also be considered.\nStructural Integrity:\nLoose bricks may indicate a broader structural issue, potentially increasing the risk of further damage. \nSeverity:\nEvaluate the potential impact of falling bricks, considering factors like:\nHeight of bricks: Higher bricks increase the potential for significant impact and injury.\nBrick material: Bricks made of heavier materials pose a higher risk.\nLocation of bricks: Bricks located near pathways, windows, or open areas increase the likelihood of someone being struck.\nCondition of bricks: Evaluate the looseness of the bricks and how long they have been loose.\nWeather conditions: Evaluate the impact of wind, rain, and temperature on the bricks.\nStructural integrity: If the wall has a history of issues, this increases the likelihood of falling bricks. \nProperty Liability Insurance:\nProperty owners are often covered for liability claims if someone is injured on their property, including injuries caused by falling bricks. \nDuty of Care:\nOwners have a duty to maintain their property and ensure it is safe for others. Failure to address loose bricks could lead to liability claims. \nNegligence:\nIf an owner knew or should have known about the loose bricks and failed to address them, they could be found liable for damages. \nWarning Signs:\nIf repairs are not feasible or immediate, warning signs can be used to alert people to the potential hazard.\nRegular Inspections:\nRegular inspections of the exterior can help identify and address loose bricks before they become a significant hazard.

After dipping to a low of 20,956, the HSI surged to a high of 27,499.

Response: India has a vast and complex legal system with numerous laws covering various aspects of life. One of the most significant laws in India is the Right to Information Act, 2005 (RTI Act). This legislation is pivotal in promoting transparency and accountability in the functioning of the government.\n\n**Right to Information Act, 2005**\n\n**Overview:**\nThe Right to Information Act was enacted by the Parliament of India in June 2005 and came into force on October 12, 2005. The act is designed to empower citizens to seek information from public authorities, thereby promoting transparency and accountability in the workings of every public authority.\n\n**Objectives:**\nThe main objectives of the RTI Act are to:\n\n1. Ensure transparency and accountability in the functioning of public authorities.\n2. Empower citizens to access information under the control of public authorities.\n3. Promote openness and reduce corruption in government and its instrumentalities.\n\n**Key Provisions:**\n- **Right to Information:** Citizens have the right to request information from public authorities, which are required to reply expeditiously or within thirty days.\n- **Public Authorities:** The act covers all constitutional authorities, including executive, judiciary, and legislature bodies, as well as any institution or body established by an act of Parliament or a state legislature.\n- **Exemptions:** There are certain exemptions to the disclosure of information to protect national security, privacy, and other sensitive matters.\n- **Procedure:** The act lays down a simple procedure for obtaining information. Citizens can file a request in writing or electronically, and the public authority is required to respond within a specified time frame.\n- **Information Commissioners:** The act provides for the appointment of a Central Information Commission and State Information Commissions to handle appeals and complaints related to the RTI requests.\n\n**Impact:**\nThe RTI Act has been instrumental in promoting transparency and accountability in government operations. It has empowered citizens to participate more actively in governance by enabling them to obtain information about public policies, decisions, and expenditures. The act has also played a significant role in uncovering corruption and maladministration.\n\n**Challenges:**\nDespite its success, the RTI Act faces several challenges, including:\n- Delays in information dissemination due to bureaucratic hurdles.\n- Lack of awareness among citizens about their rights under the act.\n- Instances of harassment and threats to RTI activists.\n\nOverall, the Right to Information Act, 2005, is a landmark legislation in India's legal framework, promoting greater transparency and accountability in the functioning of public authorities and enhancing the democratic process.

Daphne adores the way he tells their love story, but their life together comes to a screeching halt when he realizes he’s in love with his childhood best friend Petra.\n\nDaphne moves in with Petra’s ex fiance, Miles, so Petra and Peter can move in together, leaving Daphne and Miles to put their lives back together.

For example, Miles is neighborly and knows everyone in town while Daphne’s coworkers think she’s a secret agent since no one knows anything about her life. \n\nThey do their best to coexist and avoid each other in the apartment, but eventually start to form a friendship due to their close quarters. Begrudgingly, Daphne agrees to let Miles show her around town, with a countdown to her eagerly awaited Read-A-Thon (the only thing keeping her in Waning Bay) and an unexpected plan to deceive their exes.\n\nDaphne’s job as a librarian means several book references throughout the story, which warms my bookish heart. From a Station Eleven reference to alluding to the author characters from Henry’s Beach Read, these references are a bonus to help the reader illustrate Daphne’s personality based on her literary favorites. \n\nBoth Daphne and Miles are surprised by unexpected visitors, which brings some bumps in the road for their relationship – and a full apartment which presents its own challenges.

Being a leader means knowing how to lead a team to work with you and for everyone, which is impossible to do. achieve without first having clearly expressed one's intentions, the tasks and roles of each one. A leader is an example for his team, consequently he obtains, without even asking for it, the maximum respect of the people who work with him. Learning to delegate is also fundamental for a leader. But be careful because delegating does not mean placing work on the shoulders of others, but preparing people a little at a time so that they acquire gradual autonomy over time. Finally, a leader always keeps the motivation of his group high, even in moments of crisis.

Response: One legendary creature that captivates imaginations across many cultures is the dragon. Known for its majestic and fearsome presence, dragons are often depicted as large, serpentine creatures with wings, scales, and the ability to breathe fire. In Western folklore, they are typically seen as malevolent beings hoarding treasure, dwelling in caves or atop mountains, and challenging brave knights. The dragon's symbolism in the West often revolves around themes of chaos and destruction, representing a formidable force that heroes must conquer.\n\nConversely, in Eastern traditions, dragons are revered as benevolent and wise creatures. In Chinese mythology, dragons are associated with water and weather, controlling rainfall and rivers, and are considered symbols of power, strength, and good fortune.

Dragons are celebrated during festivals, such as the Dragon Boat Festival, where they are honored with vibrant rituals and races.\n\nThis dichotomy between Eastern and Western depictions of dragons highlights the fascinating diversity in cultural storytelling, where the same creature can embody vastly different traits and morals across regions.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words.

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Challenges Language Learners Often Face\n\nLearning a new language can be an exciting journey, but it also comes with many challenges. One of the most common issues is fear of making mistakes. Many students feel embarrassed to speak because they are afraid of saying something wrong. This fear can limit their progress and confidence.\n\nAnother challenge is understanding native speakers. Even after learning grammar and vocabulary, it’s often difficult to follow real conversations because of speed, accents, or slang. This can make students feel frustrated or discouraged.\n\nConsistency is also a problem. Some students struggle to find time to practice every day, and language learning requires regular effort. Without it, it’s easy to forget new words or lose motivation.\n\nLastly, some learners find grammar confusing and overwhelming, especially when it’s very different from their native language.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, students should remember that making mistakes is part of the process. Practice, patience, and exposure to real-life situations can make a big difference. Everyone learns at their own pace, and persistence always pays off.

When they see that the company's success translates to their own success, it can be a powerful motivator. Additionally, take an active interest in their career development. Offering additional training and mentorship can make a significant difference.\n\nIt's also crucial to emphasize a healthy work-life balance.

When they feel heard, even if they're voicing complaints, their overall satisfaction and productivity improve.\n\nTreat your subordinates with the same respect you would expect from your superiors. This fosters a positive and respectful work environment.\n\nOn the flip side, avoid behaviors that can demotivate your staff. Disrespecting subordinates, taking credit for their work, losing your temper, unfairly blaming them, and failing to acknowledge good work can all have negative impacts.\n\nBy focusing on these positive strategies and avoiding the negative behaviors, you can create a more motivated and effective team.\n\nBest regards,\nAdrian Correction: <input>Dear Harry,\n\nI hope this message finds you well.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: One legendary creature that fascinates me is the Kitsune from Japanese folklore. Kitsune are fox spirits known for their intelligence and magical abilities. They can shape-shift into human form, often appearing as beautiful women. Kitsune are believed to live for centuries, and as they age, they grow more tails, with the most powerful ones having up to nine tails.\n\nThese creatures are often depicted as tricksters, using their cunning to deceive humans. However, they can also be benevolent, serving as guardians and protectors. Kitsune are associated with the Shinto deity Inari, the god of rice, fertility, and prosperity. Inari's foxes are considered messengers and are often seen at shrines dedicated to this deity.\n\nThe dual nature of Kitsune—both mischievous and protective—makes them intriguing figures in Japanese mythology. Their stories reflect themes of transformation, wisdom, and the balance between good and evil. Whether as playful tricksters or loyal guardians, Kitsune continue to captivate the imagination and remain a beloved part of Japanese cultural heritage. Correction: <input>One legendary creature that fascinates me is the Kitsune from Japanese folklore. Kitsune are fox spirits known for their intelligence and magical abilities. They can shape-shift into human form, often appearing as beautiful women. Kitsune are believed to live for centuries, and as they age, they grow more tails, with the most powerful ones having up to nine tails.<code a=\"PHRA\" c=\" \">\n\n</code>These creatures are often depicted as tricksters, using their cunning to deceive humans. However, they can also be benevolent, serving as guardians and protectors. Kitsune are associated with the Shinto deity Inari, the god of rice, fertility, and prosperity. Inari's foxes are considered messengers and are often seen at shrines dedicated to this deity.<code a=\"PHRA\" c=\" \">\n\n</code>The dual nature of Kitsune—both mischievous and protective—makes them intriguing figures in Japanese mythology. Their stories reflect themes of transformation, wisdom, and the balance between good and evil. Whether as playful tricksters or loyal guardians, Kitsune continue to captivate the imagination and remain a beloved part of Japanese cultural heritage.</input>", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Learning a new language can be both exciting and challenging. What are the most common obstacles students encounter, and how can they overcome them? One major challenge is fear of making mistakes. Many learners feel embarrassed when they pronounce words incorrectly or use the wrong grammar. This fear can prevent them from practicing, which slows down progress. How can students build confidence? Practice in a supportive environment is key. Joining language exchange groups or using language apps can provide low-pressure opportunities to speak.\n\nAnother issue is lack of exposure. How often do students hear the language outside the classroom? Limited exposure to native speakers or authentic content can make it difficult to develop listening and speaking skills. Watching movies, listening to music, and reading books in the target language can help.\n\nFinally, motivation can be hard to maintain. Why do some students lose interest? If progress feels slow or the material is not engaging, learners may give up. Setting clear goals and tracking progress can make a big difference. In summary, while learning a language comes with challenges like fear, lack of exposure, and motivation loss, students can overcome them through regular practice, immersive experiences, and staying motivated.\n\n\n\n\n Correction: <input>Learning a new language can be both exciting and challenging.

Celebrities are often celebrated for little more than their superficial charm or attention-grabbing antics, which tend to overshadow genuine talent or meaningful contributions. Take, for example, someone like Kim Kardashian.

The celebrity culture perpetuates the idea that being in the public eye is more important than cultivating wisdom or contributing to the well-being of others.

Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in Spain can be a complex process, but with the right preparation, it can be manageable. The first step is to assess your finances and determine your budget, which can be done using a home affordability calculator. Once you have a clear idea of what you can afford, you can start searching for properties either online or through a real estate agent. Real estate agents can be very helpful in navigating the market and finding suitable homes. When you find a property you like, you make an offer. If the offer is accepted, you will sign a preliminary contract and pay a deposit.\n\nApplying for a home loan involves several steps. It is advisable to get preapproved for a mortgage before you start house hunting. This involves providing financial documents to the lender, who will assess your creditworthiness and determine how much they can lend you. You will need to submit various documents, including proof of income, bank statements, and identification. Once your application is reviewed, the lender will approve the loan, and you will receive a mortgage offer.\n\nHousing prices in Spain can vary significantly depending on the location, with major cities like Madrid and Barcelona being more expensive. As of early 2025, mortgage interest rates in Spain are around 6.95% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. While using a real estate agent is not mandatory, it can simplify the process of finding and purchasing a home. Mortgage brokers can help you find the best mortgage deals and navigate the application process, but their services are optional. Overall, buying a home in Spain involves several steps and requires careful planning, but with the right support, it can be a rewarding experience.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: The government is trying to create some agreements with banks supported by the banking association. For example, young couples, with low income, can have some benefits like discount on interest rate or reduced taxes. Currently, the standard interest rate is 3% but, with benefits, it can be reduced to around 2.5%. If the couple has children or the new house has a low energy impact, the benefits increase further.\nDespite these benefits, the major problems are the very restrictive rules. For example, to buy a low energy impact house, it must be newly built. However, if you have a low income, it's almost impossible to benefit a discounted interest rate.\n\nAnother problem, when buying a new house, is the extensive documentation required from various professionals. For example, you must go to a notary to register the purchase but he requires several documents like a report from an architect confirming that the house is aligns with the cadastral map. Furthermore, the real estate agent compensation is very high.\n\nIn conclusion, buying a home in Italy is very difficult and you must follow many rules to take advantage.

With a few improvements, you can reduce the risks and, consequently, your insurance costs.\n\nStarting with the exterior, loose bricks and clogged drainpipes should be repaired immediately to prevent water leaks and accidents. Additionally, the yard needs to be tidied up, and the roof needs to be inspected and repaired, as it's leaking. The sidewalk should also be cleared to ensure pedestrian safety.\n\nInside, inadequate lighting can cause accidents, so I recommend installing more powerful bulbs. Stacked boxes and loose chemicals pose serious fire hazards and must be properly organized. The fire extinguishers are old and need to be replaced with updated, functional models. Finally, considering installing an air conditioning system can improve the environment and increase the value of your business.\n\nWith these changes, in addition to making your store safer, you'll be able to get more affordable insurance quotes.

Now, most media is digital: I use my phone, tablet, and computer to read the news, watch videos, and follow social media.

Still, I enjoy the variety and interactivity of digital content: I can comment, share, and connect with others easily.

We’ve secured three major contracts that will span the next three years, ensuring strong and consistent profits.\n\nWe sincerely thank you for your continued trust and loyalty.

Its main objective was to promote economic cooperation among the three nations by removing trade restrictions like tariffs and quotas. The goal of NAFTA was to make the North American market more interconnected in order to boost trade and investment flows.\n\nThe decrease or removal of tariffs on the majority of commodities moved between the three nations was one of NAFTA's main results, which lowered product prices for consumers and expanded export prospects for companies.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: An airplane is a complex machine with several important parts that work together to make flight possible.\n\nThe fuselage is the main body of the airplane, where passengers and cargo are located. It provides structural support and holds the cockpit, where the pilots control the plane.\n\nThe wings are crucial for creating lift, allowing the plane to stay in the air. They are designed with a specific shape to help air move faster over the top than beneath, generating lift. Wings also often contain fuel tanks and may have ailerons to control the roll of the aircraft.\n\nThe tail includes the vertical stabilizer (the fin) and the horizontal stabilizer (the tailplane). The vertical stabilizer helps to keep the airplane steady by preventing unwanted side-to-side motion, while the horizontal stabilizer ensures the plane remains stable in pitch, preventing it from climbing or descending unexpectedly.\n\nFinally, the engines provide the thrust necessary for the plane to move forward. They push the airplane through the air and are usually located on the wings or the rear of the fuselage, depending on the plane's design.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Criticizing the concept of celebrity culture can be quite thought-provoking. While celebrities often inspire and entertain, the culture surrounding them can sometimes be problematic. \n\nFirstly, the **obsession with celebrity lifestyles** can lead to unrealistic expectations. People often idolize celebrities, forgetting that their public personas are carefully curated. This can create a distorted view of reality, where success and happiness are equated with fame and wealth.\n\nSecondly, the **invasion of privacy** is a significant issue. Celebrities are constantly under scrutiny, with their personal lives exposed for public consumption. This relentless attention can be detrimental to their mental health and well-being.\n\nMoreover, the **emphasis on superficial qualities** can overshadow more meaningful achievements. Society often celebrates physical appearance and material success over intellectual or moral contributions. This can perpetuate shallow values and diminish the importance of genuine accomplishments.\n\nLastly, the **influence of celebrities on public opinion** can be concerning. While some use their platform for positive change, others may spread misinformation or promote harmful behaviors.
