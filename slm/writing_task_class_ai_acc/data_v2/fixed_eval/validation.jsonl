This is a tough decision, but here’s my perspective:\n\nStaying in our current location has clear advantages. We’re in a prime district with loyal customers who value the convenience of visiting us downtown. The showroom is a big draw, offering a tactile experience and personalized service that sets us apart. However, the 25% rent increase significantly impacts our profitability, and with Centerville’s growth, future increases seem inevitable.\n\nMoving to the south side and adopting a hybrid model offers substantial cost savings. A better website and office visits could attract a broader customer base and improve convenience. Still, we’d lose the showroom experience, which has been key to building trust and relationships. This transition would also require upfront investments in technology and logistics.\n\nPerhaps there’s a middle ground: negotiating with the landlord for gradual rent increases, sharing the showroom space, or piloting office visits and an enhanced website while staying temporarily<code a=\"PHRA\" c=\". We could also consider a new location that’s slightly more affordable yet still central, maintaining our presence in a busy area\"></code>.\n\nI’m open to discussing these ideas or seeking advice from others with similar experiences.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: nan", "text_b": "<input>Corporate Social Responsibility: A Necessity, Not an Option\n\nThe debate over corporate social responsibility (CSR) highlights a fundamental question: should businesses focus solely on profits, or do they owe something to society? While some argue that corporations should prioritize shareholder value, I believe CSR is not only morally justified but also strategically beneficial.  \n\nCompanies operate within societies, drawing resources, labor, and infrastructure from the communities they serve. In return, they have an ethical obligation to give back. Investing in sustainable practices, fair wages, and community development builds trust and goodwill, strengthening long-term relationships with both employees and customers. For instance, as Jack@MSU points out, companies with strong CSR records enjoy greater customer loyalty, which translates into higher profitability.  \n\nMoreover, CSR fosters innovation and resilience. Addressing environmental challenges, for example, can lead to cost savings and the development of new technologies. Businesses that integrate CSR into their strategies are better equipped to adapt to changing regulations and social expectations.  \n\nCritics argue, like theG8T, that businesses should focus solely on profit and leave societal welfare to governments. However, this perspective ignores the interconnectedness of modern economies. Governments may set regulations, but corporations have the resources and influence to drive progress faster and more effectively.  \n\nIn conclusion, CSR is not just philanthropy; it’s a long-term investment in stability and growth. By embracing social responsibility, companies can secure both public trust and financial success.</input>", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label_accuracy": 0, "label_coherence": 0, "label_range": 0, "is_100_agreement": false}

The energy of the city is contagious, and people often rely on public transportation to get around due to the city's compact nature.\n\nIn contrast, Los Angeles presents a more laid-back atmosphere. While it is a major urban hub, its sprawling layout and car-centric culture create a more relaxed vibe compared to New York. The city is famous for its entertainment industry, with Hollywood being the heart of the film and television world. The sunny weather and proximity to beautiful beaches also make Los Angeles a more outdoor-oriented city, with residents enjoying activities like hiking, surfing, or relaxing by the ocean.\n\nWhile New York thrives on its density and constant activity, Los Angeles shines with its open spaces and focus on leisure.

{"orig_idx": 1935, "text_a": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Cubing and loop writing are both creative techniques used in the fields of writing and thinking to organize and develop ideas.\nCubing is a method inspired by the idea of looking at an object from all six sides. In writing, it involves exploring a topic from six different perspectives to gain a more comprehensive understanding. These perspectives include describing, comparing, associating, analyzing, applying, and arguing. For example, when writing about a historical event, a writer might first describe the event, then compare it to similar events, analyze its causes and effects, and argue its significance. Cubing helps expand ideas and allows for a more multidimensional approach to a topic, fostering deeper thinking and more nuanced writing.\nLoop writing is a technique in which a writer continually refines and revises their work through repeated drafts. In loop writing, a writer begins with a basic idea or rough draft and then revises it in loops, each time deepening the focus or expanding on specific details. The process can help clarify ideas, improve structure, and strengthen arguments. It's particularly effective for exploring new concepts, allowing writers to see connections between thoughts that may not have been apparent in the initial draft.\nBoth cubing and loop writing encourage flexible, iterative thinking, offering structured ways to enhance creativity and thoughtfulness in writing.\n", "text_b": "<input><code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"In\">Cubing and loop writing are both creative techniques used in</code> the <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"preceding units, nine\">fields of</code> writing <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"techniques were introduced\">and thinking to organize and develop ideas.\nCubing is a method inspired by </code><code a=\"PHRA\" c=\":\">the</code> <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"metaphor\">idea of looking at </code><code a=\"PHRA\" c=\",\">an</code> <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"hyperbole,\">object from all six</code> <code a=\"NOUN\" c=\"symbolism\">sides</code><code a=\"PUNCT\" c=\",\">.</code> <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"free\">In</code> writing, <code a=\"PRON\" c=\"\">it </code><code a=\"VERB\" c=\"focused\">involves exploring</code> <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"free writing\">a topic from six different perspectives to gain a more comprehensive understanding.

After this notification, the passengers deplaned normally using an air stair.\nUpon touchdown, the tires rapidly deflated and tore apart, and both wheels were worn into the axle.

Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, metaphor and free writing seem the most useful to me. Metaphors provide a powerful way to express complex ideas in a more relatable and creative way, allowing me to paint vivid pictures with words. By comparing one thing to another, metaphors can deepen the meaning of my writing and create emotional connections with readers. For example, describing a challenging situation as “a storm waiting to pass” can convey struggle but also hope, in a more impactful way than simply stating the situation is difficult.\nFree writing, on the other hand, offers a way to overcome writer's block and generate ideas freely without worrying about structure or correctness. It allows my thoughts to flow without restriction, making it easier to explore different angles on a topic. This technique is particularly useful when I need to brainstorm or break through mental barriers.

Response: nan", "text_b": "<input>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a crucial aspect of modern business that extends beyond profit-making to encompass ethical, environmental, and social considerations. As businesses wield significant influence in society, it is imperative for them to operate responsibly and contribute positively to the communities they serve.\n\nProponents argue that CSR fosters a positive brand image and can lead to increased customer loyalty. In an era where consumers are increasingly aware of social issues, companies that demonstrate genuine commitment to ethical practices and sustainable development are more likely to attract and retain customers. Additionally, CSR initiatives can boost employee morale and attract talent, as individuals often prefer to work for organizations that align with their personal values.\n\nMoreover, CSR can mitigate risks and enhance long-term profitability. By proactively addressing environmental concerns and social challenges, companies can avoid potential legal issues and reputational damage. For instance, adopting sustainable practices can reduce operational costs related to waste management and energy consumption.\n\nCritics, however, argue that CSR can sometimes be superficial, serving as a marketing tool rather than reflecting genuine commitment. They caution against \"greenwashing,\" where companies exaggerate their environmental efforts to mislead consumers.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the benefits of CSR are undeniable. It is essential for companies to integrate CSR into their core strategies genuinely and transparently. By doing so, businesses not only contribute to societal well-being but also ensure sustainable growth and resilience in an ever-evolving market landscape. Ultimately, corporate social responsibility is not just a trend but a fundamental business imperative that drives positive change.</input>", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label_accuracy": 0, "label_coherence": 0, "label_range": 0, "is_100_agreement": true}

Response: nan", "text_b": "<input>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become a fundamental aspect of modern business practices, reflecting an organization’s commitment to ethical behavior, sustainable development, and the well-being of society. As businesses continue to recognize their influential role in the global landscape, CSR initiatives have emerged as a vital component for fostering trust and building a positive brand image.\n\nOne of the key arguments in favor of CSR is its potential to create shared value for both businesses and communities. By integrating social and environmental considerations into their operations, companies can drive innovation, reduce costs, and open new market opportunities. For instance, sustainable practices such as energy efficiency and waste reduction not only benefit the environment but also result in significant cost savings for businesses.\n\nMoreover, CSR initiatives can enhance a company's reputation and strengthen its relationship with stakeholders, including customers, employees, and investors. Consumers today are increasingly inclined to support brands that align with their values, and a strong CSR strategy can serve as a powerful differentiator in a competitive market. Similarly, employees are more likely to feel motivated and loyal when they work for a company that demonstrates a genuine commitment to social and environmental issues.\n\nHowever, it is crucial for companies to approach CSR authentically, avoiding superficial or insincere efforts commonly referred to as \"greenwashing.\" Transparency and accountability should be at the forefront of any CSR strategy to ensure that businesses truly contribute to societal progress.\n\nIn conclusion, corporate social responsibility is not merely a philanthropic endeavor but a strategic approach that can drive sustainable business success while contributing positively to society. By embracing CSR, companies can play a pivotal role in addressing global challenges while securing their long-term growth and relevance.</input>", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label_accuracy": 0, "label_coherence": 0, "label_range": 0, "is_100_agreement": true}

So, I decided to take a spontaneous trip to the countryside for some fresh air and relaxation. Little did I know, it would turn into one of the most memorable experiences ever!\n\nAs I was wandering through a quaint little village, I stumbled upon a local festival. The villagers were celebrating the annual \"Cow Parade,\" where they dress up their cows in colorful costumes and parade them through the streets. It was a sight to behold! Imagine cows wearing hats, sunglasses, and even tutus. I couldn't stop laughing!\n\nBut here's where it gets even weirder. One of the cows, named Daisy, seemed to take a liking to me. She followed me around the entire festival, much to the amusement of the locals. They started calling me \"Daisy's new best friend.\" At one point, Daisy even tried to eat my hat! I had to gently wrestle it away from her, which made everyone burst into laughter.\n\nTo top it all off, the villagers invited me to join their traditional dance. Picture me, awkwardly trying to keep up with their energetic moves while Daisy watched from the sidelines. It was hilarious and heartwarming at the same time.\n\nI left the village with a huge smile on my face and a promise to return next year. Who knew a simple trip to the countryside could turn into such an unforgettable adventure?\n\nCan't wait to catch up soon!\n\nCheers, Gayatri</input>", "task_id": "52a760cd-9898-4cce-bb43-c490923b2b45", "ef_level": 13.0, "label_accuracy": 0, "label_coherence": 0, "label_range": 0, "is_100_agreement": false}

On one hand, proponents argue that companies have a duty to contribute positively to society. On the other hand, critics believe that a company’s primary responsibility is to its shareholders. Here’s my take on the debate:\n\nFor CSR: Companies do not operate in a vacuum; they are integral parts of the communities in which they function. By engaging in CSR, businesses can foster goodwill and build stronger relationships with their stakeholders. For instance, sustainable practices and fair employee benefits not only secure future possibilities but also enhance productivity and reduce turnover.\n\nAgainst CSR: Critics like <code a=\"NOUN\" c=\"Milton \">theG8</code><code a=\"NOUN\" c=\"Friedman\">T</code> argue that the primary responsibility of a business is to increase its profits<code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"\">, as Milton Friedman famously stated</code>. They believe that CSR initiatives can be seen as a distraction from this goal. Additionally, some argue that CSR efforts are often minimal compared to a company’s total earnings and can be viewed as a marketing strategy rather than a genuine commitment to social good.\n\nConclusion: While the debate continues, it is clear that CSR can offer significant benefits to both companies and society. By balancing profit-making with social responsibility, businesses can achieve sustainable growth and contribute to the well-being of their communities.</input>", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label_accuracy": 0, "label_coherence": 0, "label_range": 5, "is_100_agreement": true}

An immigrant might enter the country legally, but when they stay longer than permitted or violate the provisions of their visa, they have committed an infraction and may have to pay a fine or <code a=\"PRON\" c=\"\">they </code>may be deported, or both.\n\nOn the other hand, crossing the border of a country illegally is considered a federal crime. Immigrants from other countries who do not qualify for an entry visa may try to sneak across the border to gain entry. Although this tends to happen quite often because of economic reasons, with people migrating from poorer countries to richer countries, it can happen in almost any country for any reason.\n\nTwo even more serious methods of illegal immigration are people smuggling and people trafficking. Many people think these two phrases refer to the same <code a=\"NOUN\" c=\"offense\">offence</code>; however<code a=\"PUNCT\" c=\", \"></code>they are two very different crimes.\n\nPeople smuggling takes place with the consent of the person being smuggled illegally into a country, whereas people trafficking is the illegal trade in human beings, usually for the purpose of forced labor or sexual exploitation. Either way, a person can be hidden from the authorities in the cargo of a boat or truck, for example, or they can pass through checkpoints using fraudulent passports or other counterfeit documents<code a=\"PHRA\" c=\". \n\nPrompt given to student:\nListen to the conversation again.

In major urban areas like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore, housing can be expensive, and demand often exceeds supply. Prices vary significantly depending on the location and size of the property.\n\nPurchasing property involves a significant amount of paperwork. Buyers need to ensure clear title deeds, encumbrance certificates, and sales agreements. It's crucial to verify the legal aspects to avoid future disputes.\n\nApplying for a home loan requires filling out various forms and providing documentation such as identity proof, address proof, income proof, and property documents. The process can be time-consuming and may involve several rounds of verification.\n\nAs of late 2023, home loan interest rates in India typically range from 6.5% to 9%, depending on the lender, loan amount, tenure, and the applicant’s credit profile. Rates are subject to change based on Reserve Bank of India (RBI) policies and market conditions.\n\nProperty prices in India can be quite high, particularly in metropolitan areas. Suburban and rural areas may offer more affordable options, but accessibility and infrastructure can vary.\n\nWhile not mandatory, using a real estate agent can be beneficial. They can help navigate the local market, negotiate prices, and ensure the legal and documentation processes are correctly followed. Mortgage brokers can assist in finding suitable loan products and negotiating favorable terms with banks. They can simplify the loan application process and offer personalized advice.\n\nBuyers need to be aware of regulatory requirements, such as the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), which aims to protect consumer interests and enhance transparency.\n\nA good credit score is crucial for obtaining favorable loan terms. Applicants should ensure their financial profiles are in order before applying.\n\nThe process can be time-consuming and requires due diligence, patience, and careful planning to avoid pitfalls.\n\nIn conclusion, buying a home in India and applying for a home loan involves navigating a complex landscape of legal, financial, and logistical considerations.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: nan", "text_b": "<input>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an important concept that reflects a company's commitment to ethical practices, environmental sustainability, and community well-being. In today’s world, consumers, investors, and employees increasingly expect businesses to take responsibility for their impact on society beyond just profit-making. I believe CSR is essential for long-term business success and <code a=\"VERB\" c=\"offers\">has</code> several key benefits.\n\nFirstly, CSR helps build trust with customers. Companies that engage in socially responsible actions, such as reducing their carbon footprint or supporting local communities, are often seen as more trustworthy and reputable. This positive reputation can lead to increased customer loyalty and even higher sales. For example, companies like Patagonia and Ben & Jerry’s have gained strong customer bases by committing to environmental sustainability and social justice initiatives.\n\nAdditionally, CSR contributes to employee satisfaction. Workers tend to feel more motivated and engaged when they know their employer is involved in meaningful projects that benefit society. This sense of purpose can lead to increased productivity and lower turnover rates.\n\nHowever, some critics argue that CSR is just a marketing tool, with businesses using it to improve their image without making substantial changes. While this may be true for some companies, I believe that true CSR goes beyond superficial gestures. It involves making long-term, tangible efforts to address social and environmental challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, CSR is not just an ethical obligation but a smart business strategy. By aligning profit-making with social good, companies can create a positive impact on society while achieving sustainable growth.</input>", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label_accuracy": 0, "label_coherence": 0, "label_range": 5, "is_100_agreement": true}

Response: nan", "text_b": "<input>Buying a home and applying for a home loan can be a multifaceted process that varies significantly depending on the country and its housing market. Generally, this journey involves several key steps, starting with assessing your financial readiness to purchase a property. This includes evaluating your savings for a down payment, understanding your credit score, and calculating affordability.\n\nHousing prices can fluctuate drastically based on location, market conditions, and economic factors. In many urban areas, housing tends to be expensive, making it challenging for first-time buyers to enter the market. Conversely, rural areas might offer more affordable options, though they may come with trade-offs in terms of amenities and employment opportunities.\n\nApplying for a home loan usually involves filling out numerous forms and providing documentation such as proof of income, tax records, and identification. The complexity of this process can depend on the country's specific regulations and the lender's requirements. Interest rates also vary, influenced by central bank policies, inflation, and economic health; they can range from relatively low to high depending on these factors.\n\nWhile it's not mandatory to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker, they can offer invaluable assistance. A real estate agent helps navigate property listings and negotiations, while a mortgage broker can find favorable loan terms and rates.

After doing a quick risk assessment, I can see why your insurance quotes are coming back high. There are several issues that need fixing to reduce your risks and potentially lower your premiums.\n\n**Exterior:**\nYou’ve got loose bricks, blocked drainpipes, and an untidy yard — all of which are hazards, especially for customers and delivery people. The sidewalk clutter also increases the chance of trips and falls. These should be cleared and repaired quickly.\n\n**Interior:**\nInside, the stacked boxes and old fire extinguishers are worrying. They could block exits and won’t be effective in an emergency. The loose chemicals pose a serious fire and health risk — they must be removed or properly stored. Although there’s no air conditioning, that’s not a major insurance issue, but poor lighting definitely is. Consider brighter, safer lighting.\n\nAddressing these problems will not only improve safety but also make your insurance more affordable.

Look out for controlling behavior, isolation from family and friends, and threats or intimidation.\n\n2. **Provide Support**: It's crucial for victims to feel heard and believed. Let them know they’re not alone and that help is available. Avoid criticizing their decisions; it's important to let them choose when they’re ready to act.\n\n3. **Seek Professional Help**: SOADA offers counseling, legal advice, and emergency shelter. Encourage anyone who is being abused to reach out to them directly, as all communications are confidential.\n\n4. **Call for Help**: If someone is in immediate danger, don’t hesitate to call the police. Their safety is the top priority.\n\nI really suggest you or anyone in your community who needs help to get in touch with SOADA directly. They can provide the support and confidentiality needed.

Additionally, language learners often struggle with listening comprehension due to the speed of native speech and the presence of idiomatic expressions or slang. This can result in a lack of confidence in speaking and engaging in conversations.\n\nCultural differences also pose challenges, as language learning is closely tied to understanding cultural contexts and social norms. Language students may face anxiety and embarrassment in real-world interactions, fearing mistakes or judgment.

Metaphor allows writers to convey complex ideas and emotions through vivid and relatable comparisons, making abstract concepts more tangible and engaging for readers. For instance, describing a challenging situation as \"an uphill battle\" instantly evokes a sense of struggle and perseverance.\n\nSymbolism, on the other hand, adds depth and layers of meaning to a narrative. By using symbols, writers can imbue their work with richer significance, encouraging readers to explore underlying themes and interpretations. This technique can transform a simple story into a profound exploration of universal truths.\n\nQuestioning is another invaluable technique<code a=\"PUNCT\" c=\" \">, </code>as it prompts critical thinking and introspection.

Response: nan", "text_b": "<input>These days, nearly everyone has heard of identity theft, a crime that costs companies and individuals millions of dollars per year. However, counterfeiting documents is not a new crime; it has been plaguing societies for ages.\n\nFortunately, there are measures that can help <code a=\"VERB:FORM\" c=\"\">to </code>reduce the occurrence of counterfeiting, and might even be able to prevent it. The two main forms of anti-counterfeiting measures used today are Questioned Document Examination (QDE) and security printing. QDE is a scientific process that focuses on questioning a document’s history, whereas security printing makes it almost impossible to reproduce the document in the same form as the original.\n\nThe primary purpose of QDE is to verify the origins of a disputed document using a variety of scientific methods. On the other hand, security printing deals with the printing of items such as currency, passports, stock certificates, identity cards, and more. Security printing includes features such as holograms, watermarks, color-changing inks, and microprinting, as well as security threads, which should appear as solid lines if the document is genuine.\n\nAdditionally, microchips are now inserted into documents as part of the security printing process, so that they can be scanned, and fraudulent documents detected more easily. Conversely, serial numbers are part of the QDE process. Although they are not a technological innovation like the other security measures, they still make legitimate documents easier to track and audit.\n\nSimilarly, a thick, heavy paper made of cotton fibers or polymers is used to print banknotes, and intaglio printing on bills, which involves incising an image onto a surface, helps non-experts easily spot forgeries. Lastly, a genuine document is easy to spot if it is printed with one of three types of color-changing ink. For example, it may appear as copper from one angle<code a=\"PUNCT\" c=\" \">, </code>and green from another.\n\nBoth QDE and security printing not only help law enforcement officials recognize a counterfeit document, but they also help the untrained person know a fake when they see it, greatly reducing the incidence of counterfeiting and saving companies and individuals millions.<code a=\"ORTH\" c=\"\"> </code></input>", "task_id": "8b0a764a-4cfb-498f-8a8f-6264ffb7c64c", "ef_level": 7.0, "label_accuracy": 0, "label_coherence": 0, "label_range": 0, "is_100_agreement": true}

Becoming a doctor is indeed a long and challenging journey, but it’s also incredibly rewarding. Medical training typically starts with a four-year medical school program after your undergraduate degree, followed by several years of residency and possibly fellowship. Clinical training is hands-on, involving a lot of direct patient care, which can be tough at times due to the emotional and physical demands. You’ll work long hours, deal with complex cases, and continually be learning. But it’s also where you build your skills and truly begin to understand the practice of medicine.\n\nThere are many options within the medical field. You could specialize in areas like surgery, pediatrics, cardiology, psychiatry, or family medicine, to name a few. Each specialty has its own unique path and lifestyle.\n\nAs for finances, medical residents and fellows are indeed paid, but it often feels like a tight budget due to the years of training and student loans. While the pay increases significantly as you become an attending physician, you may need to budget carefully in the earlier years.\n\nWorking in a clinic or hospital is fast-paced and can be stressful, but it’s also where you can make a real difference in patients’ lives. You<code a=\"CONTR\" c=\"’ll\">'ll</code> work with a team, and though there are challenges, many find the sense of fulfillment to be worth it.\n\nI hope this helps!

Be sure to keep the following points in mind: Types of counterfeit goods, the effect of counterfeiting on society, the signs of a fake, what to do if you discover fake goods.  Write 250-300 words. Response: nan", "text_b": "<input>Understanding and <code a=\"VERB:FORM\" c=\"Combatting\">Combating</code> Counterfeit Goods\n\nCounterfeit goods are fake products made to look like genuine items. They range from clothing, accessories, and electronics to pharmaceuticals and luxury items. These products often imitate popular brands but are produced without permission, harming both companies and consumers.\n\nTypes of Counterfeit Goods\n\nCommon counterfeit items include designer clothes, shoes, watches, handbags, and electronics. Sometimes even medicines and automotive parts are counterfeited, which can be dangerous due to poor quality and safety standards.\n\nThe Impact of Counterfeiting on Society\n\nCounterfeiting affects more than just companies losing revenue. It can lead to job losses, undermine brand reputation, and reduce innovation. For consumers, fake products can pose serious health and safety risks. For example, counterfeit medicines may contain harmful ingredients, and fake electronics might cause accidents or fires. Moreover, the illegal trade often funds organized crime and weakens the economy.\n\nHow to Spot Fake Goods\n\nWhen shopping, always examine your purchases carefully before leaving the store or market. Genuine products usually have high-quality materials, clear logos, and consistent packaging. Be cautious if prices are unusually low for desirable brands—this is a common sign of counterfeit goods. Avoid buying from street vendors without a proper trading license, and never buy products from stands outside malls, as these are often unregulated.\n\nWhat to Do if You Discover Counterfeit Goods\n\nIf you suspect a product is fake, do not buy it. Instead, report the seller to the police or relevant consumer protection authorities immediately. Your report can help prevent others from falling victim to counterfeiters. Remember, buying counterfeit goods encourages illegal activity and undermines the safety and economy of your community.\n\nBy staying vigilant and making informed purchases, everyone can play a part in fighting counterfeit goods and supporting authentic, safe products.</input>", "task_id": "788dc6fa-5111-4a7c-b2c1-a9ddebd0b1a2", "ef_level": 7.0, "label_accuracy": 0, "label_coherence": 0, "label_range": 0, "is_100_agreement": false}
