Response: nan", "text_b": "<input>The Big Online Debate\nDo you believe companies have a responsibility to society? Or do you think a company's only responsibility is to its shareholders? We invite you to join this discussion by posting your opinion on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nFor CSR\n\nCompanies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"\">it's </code>the same <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"applies to\">with</code> sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well<code a=\"PUNCT\" c=\", \"></code>and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders<code a=\"NOUN:POSS\" c=\"\">'</code>.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925<code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"\n\nPrompt given to student:\nA website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words.\n\nEF level: 13\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) remains a contentious issue. On one hand, proponents argue that CSR is vital for businesses as it fosters goodwill and ensures sustainable growth.

Response: nan", "text_b": "<input>Is Corporate Social Responsibility Really a Duty or Just PR?\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is often praised as a moral obligation companies have toward society. Supporters argue that businesses thrive because of communities, resources, and infrastructure, so giving back is a form of ethical reciprocity. By supporting education, sustainability, and social initiatives, corporations don’t just elevate their public image—they foster long-term trust and stability.\n\nHowever, critics suggest that CSR is less about ethics and more about marketing. They argue that many companies adopt CSR to polish their reputation, not to contribute meaningfully. When CSR programs are poorly funded or disconnected from a company’s core values, they become hollow gestures. Moreover, focusing too much on CSR might distract companies from their primary role—creating economic value and jobs.\n\nStill, CSR need not be a binary of profit vs. principle. In fact, strong CSR initiatives can drive profit by aligning business goals with societal needs. For instance, companies investing in green technology not only help the planet but also future-proof their operations.\n\nIn contrast to the view that CSR is mere PR, its real value lies in integrating social good with business strategy.

These illegal replicas cover a wide range of categories, including luxury fashion (handbags, shoes, watches), electronics (phones, headphones, chargers), pharmaceuticals (medicines, supplements), cosmetics, toys, auto parts, and even food and beverages.\n\nThe effects of counterfeiting on society are severe and widespread. Economically, it causes global losses worth hundreds of billions of dollars annually, reducing tax revenue and threatening jobs. For businesses, it means damaged reputations and decreased trust in genuine brands. More critically, counterfeit goods often fail safety standards, posing health risks. Fake medicines may contain incorrect or harmful ingredients. Counterfeit electronics can overheat or explode. Even counterfeit toys can include toxic materials. Beyond individual risks, profits from counterfeiting have been linked to organized crime, terrorism, and human trafficking.\n\nSpotting counterfeit goods isn’t always easy, but there are red flags. Warning signs include misspelled brand names, poor packaging quality, no product registration or authenticity code, unusually low prices, and sellers operating through unofficial or shady websites.\n\nIf you suspect a product is fake, do not buy it. If you already purchased it, report it to consumer protection agencies, the original brand, or law enforcement. Many companies offer authenticity verification tools and reporting platforms on their websites.\n\nTo protect yourself and others, always buy from authorized sellers or brand-certified stores.

Studies show that companies with a strong focus on employee well-being tend to have more engaged workers, lower turnover rates, and, ultimately, higher productivity and profitability.\n\nFor example, implementing a flexible work model allows employees to balance their professional and personal lives better, leading to increased satisfaction and productivity.

Most wells focused on one specific rock layer. Our research shows the field has the right conditions for oil and gas, but we haven't drilled enough to be sure. There is a chance of finding a lot of oil, but it's risky due to the limited number of wells.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe think Carlos Field might have about 21 million barrels of oil. With better technology, we could possibly find more.

After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well<code a=\"PUNCT\" c=\", \"></code>and communities around the world benefit.\n– Jack@MSU\n\nAs an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.\n– James.W@efstudent.com\n\nAgainst CSR\n\nThe problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.\n– theG8T\n\nIt's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.\n– JackD_92\n\nIt's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.\n– patty925<code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"\n\nPrompt given to student:\nA website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility.

But what might surprise you is that our roots actually lie in the travel industry. Yes, we started out as a travel agency back in 2000, helping people plan their dream vacations and business trips. Our original focus was on creating seamless travel experiences, and that emphasis on service and attention to detail is something we’ve carried through as we evolved.\n\nSlide 3: The Shift to Finance \n\nSo, how did we go from planning vacations to managing portfolios? Well, like any growing company, we recognized new opportunities and made some big changes. In the early 2005, we made a strategic shift into the finance sector. It was a bold move, but we saw a gap in the market for a financial services company that brought the same level of personalization and care that we had in travel. And it worked. Over the past few years, we’ve grown exponentially, expanding our services to include everything from wealth management to corporate financial solutions.”</input>", "task_id": "78f976f6-a505-4597-877b-94d9bca3b217", "ef_level": 7.0, "label_accuracy": 0, "label_coherence": 0, "label_range": 1, "is_100_agreement": false}

We also open up a much better webpage than what we have now so that customers can view our clothing options and enter their measurements. Incredible cost savings! The con of that is that we lose the showroom, where customers can just come in and look at the possibilities, feel the cloth and talk to us about what would be appropriate for them.

I packed a few essentials, hopped in my car, and set off on an adventure.\n\nAbout an hour into the drive, I stumbled upon a quirky little town hosting an annual \"Llama Parade.\" Yes, you read that right—a parade featuring llamas! People were dressed in colorful costumes, and each llama had its own hilarious outfit. One even wore a tiny top hat and bow tie, looking like a llama gentleman.\n\nThe best part? They let spectators join the parade! I couldn't resist, so I grabbed a rainbow wig from a vendor and joined in. Walking alongside those majestically awkward creatures was surreal and utterly delightful. I spent the rest of the day exploring the town's eclectic shops and sampling homemade fudge from a quaint little bakery.\n\nIt was such an unexpected and joyful day.

Citizens can file a request in writing or electronically, and the public authority is required to respond within a specified time frame.\n- **Information Commissioners:** The act provides for the appointment of a Central Information Commission and State Information Commissions to handle appeals and complaints related to the RTI requests.\n\n**Impact:**\nThe RTI Act has been instrumental in promoting transparency and accountability in government operations. It has empowered citizens to participate more actively in governance by enabling them to obtain information about public policies, decisions, and expenditures.

Young people do not want to waste time driving and waiting in traffic.\n\nAnother contributing factor is the issue of sustainability. The environment has become a much higher profile issue in recent years, and the development of public transport as a more environmentally friendly and convenient option, especially in larger cities, has led to a significant increase in its use among the younger generations. In addition, public transport is a very good way to save <code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"\">money.\n\nCuts are also happening in air travel. Airlines seem to have thought of every way to cut costs, from cutting staff to reducing the number of flights. The flip side, however, is that there are many budget airlines out there that offer heavier travelers cheaper flights than ever before.\n\nThe topic of the future is space tourism. There are now travel agencies that specialize in space travel, at least for those who have enough </code>money<code a=\"ORTH\" c=\"\"> </code><code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"\">for it. Although space tourism is aimed at the high-end market, it may one day reach the mass market and offer an extraordinary vacation to millions of ordinary tourists</code>.\n\nQuite an interesting topic?

Curiosity piqued, he decided to take a closer look.\n\nInside the cabin, Alex found a dusty, leather-bound journal on a rickety table. The journal belonged to a man named Samuel, who had lived in the cabin over a century ago. As Alex read through the pages, he discovered that Samuel was a treasure hunter who had buried a chest of gold somewhere in the mountains. The journal contained cryptic clues and a hand-drawn map leading to the treasure.\n\nExcited by the possibility of finding the hidden treasure, Alex spent the next few days deciphering the clues and following the map. After several days of searching, he finally unearthed an old, weathered chest filled with gold coins and precious gems. Alex couldn't believe his luck and decided to donate a portion of the treasure to a local charity, ensuring that Samuel's legacy would live on.\n\nThis incredible adventure not only brought excitement to Alex's life but also made a positive impact on the community.

{"orig_idx": 2770, "text_a": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Free writing is often considered a foundational technique in the writing process due to its liberating nature. By setting aside concerns about correctness or coherence, writers can focus purely on the act of writing, allowing their subconscious to surface ideas that might be stifled by self-editing. This uninhibited flow of thoughts can be particularly useful in overcoming writer's block—a common challenge where the pressure to produce perfect prose prevents any prose from being produced at all.\n\nThe beauty of free writing lies in its unpredictability. Writers often find themselves exploring tangents or uncovering themes they hadn’t initially considered. This can lead to unexpected connections between ideas, providing a rich tapestry of material to draw from in later stages of writing. Once the raw material is generated, writers can start identifying patterns or themes that resonate, using techniques like symbolism to add depth or metaphor to convey complex emotions and ideas more vividly.\n\nAfter free writing, focused free writing can be employed to hone in on specific aspects of the text that seem promising. This involves taking the initial stream of consciousness and directing it towards a particular topic or theme, allowing writers to develop and elaborate on ideas that emerged during the initial free writing session.\n\nLoop writing is another technique that builds on the foundation of free writing. It involves taking a single idea or sentence from the free writing piece and using it as a prompt for another round of writing. This iterative process can deepen exploration and understanding, leading to more nuanced content.\n\nListing is another technique that can complement free writing. By creating lists related to themes, characters, or settings, writers can organize their thoughts and identify elements that need more development. This can lead to a clearer structure when drafting more formal versions of their work.\n\nHyperbole and metaphor can be particularly effective in refining the emotional impact and expressive power of the writing. Hyperbole, with its exaggerated statements, can emphasize key points or evoke strong feelings, while metaphor can encapsulate complex ideas in relatable imagery, creating a bridge between the abstract and the tangible.\n\nSymbolism adds another layer of meaning to writing. By embedding symbols into a narrative, writers can convey themes and messages subtly, inviting readers to interpret and find deeper significance in the text.\n\nIn essence, while free writing provides the raw material and initial inspiration, these other techniques serve as tools to refine, structure, and enrich the writing, allowing for a more polished and impactful final product.

After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.\n– lil@213\n\nThe reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care.

Metaphor stands out because it allows me to convey complex ideas through vivid comparisons, making my writing more engaging and helping readers relate abstract concepts to familiar images. For instance, describing a challenge as a \"mountain to climb\" immediately evokes a sense of struggle and effort, enhancing the emotional impact of the writing.\n\nFocused free writing is valuable because it helps me explore a specific idea or topic in a spontaneous, unrestricted way while still keeping me on track. This technique is especially helpful when I'm stuck, as it allows my thoughts to flow naturally, often leading to unexpected insights.\n\nListing, on the other hand, is a highly practical tool that helps me organize my thoughts and ideas quickly. When I need to brainstorm or outline my work, listing provides a clear structure and ensures I don't forget important points.

While making a profit is necessary for any business to survive, ignoring the impact they have on communities, the environment, and their employees is short-sighted and ultimately harmful — both ethically and financially.\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is not just about giving to charity or sponsoring local events. It’s about operating in a way that is ethical, transparent, and respectful to all stakeholders — including customers, workers, suppliers, and the environment.

A happy workforce is more productive, and customers stay loyal to companies they respect.

I’ve been thinking about our current situation and the two options we’ve discussed. While both have their merits, I wanted to propose a third option that might offer a balanced solution.\n\nThird Option: Hybrid Model\n\nWe could consider a hybrid approach where we maintain a smaller, more cost-effective showroom in a less expensive part of town, while also enhancing our online presence and offering personalized services at clients’ locations. Here’s how it could work:\n\nSmaller Showroom: We relocate to a more affordable area, reducing our rent significantly. This showroom would be smaller but still provide a space for customers to see and feel our fabrics and discuss their needs in person.\nEnhanced Online Platform: We invest in a top-notch website where customers can browse our collections, enter their measurements, and even schedule appointments for fittings at their convenience.\nMobile Tailoring Service: We offer a mobile service where we visit clients at their offices or homes for measurements and fittings. This personalized touch can help maintain the close relationships we’ve built with our customers.<code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"\n\n\">\n</code>Benefits:\n\nCost Savings: Lower rent and operational costs.\nCustomer Convenience: Clients can choose between visiting the showroom or having us come to them.\nFlexibility: We can adapt to changing market conditions more easily.<code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"\n\n\">\n</code>I believe this hybrid model could provide the best of both worlds, combining the personal touch of our current showroom with the cost savings and convenience of a more modern approach.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\nBest regards, \nPrayad</input>", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "ef_level": 15.0, "label_accuracy": 0, "label_coherence": 0, "label_range": 1, "is_100_agreement": false}

This often involves repetitive practice and finding ways to incorporate new terms into daily use, which can be time-consuming and sometimes overwhelming.\n\nAnother challenge is mastering grammar rules. Languages often have complex and nuanced grammatical structures that can confuse learners. What strategies can students use to overcome this? Consistent practice, exposure to native speakers, and using language apps or resources that offer grammar exercises are common approaches.\n\nPronunciation and listening comprehension also pose significant hurdles. How can learners improve these skills? Immersive experiences, such as watching films or engaging in conversation with native speakers, can enhance these abilities. However, access to such resources can be limited depending on the learner's environment.\n\nAdditionally, motivation and consistency are critical issues. How do students maintain their enthusiasm over time? Setting achievable goals, tracking progress, and celebrating small victories can help sustain motivation.\n\nCultural nuances and idiomatic expressions add another layer of complexity. How can students navigate these? Engaging with the culture through literature, media, and interaction with native speakers can provide valuable context and understanding.\n\nOverall, language learning requires dedication, patience, and strategic approaches to overcome these common challenges.</input>", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "ef_level": 15.0, "label_accuracy": 0, "label_coherence": 0, "label_range": 1, "is_100_agreement": true}

Different languages have different sentence structures, tenses, and word orders, which can be confusing. For instance, in German, nouns have genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), and in Japanese, the verb typically comes at the end of the sentence. These differences can create confusion, especially for beginners.\n\n**Vocabulary acquisition** is another struggle. Memorizing new words, especially when they don't have direct translations or when they appear in idiomatic expressions, can be difficult. Additionally, learners may face issues with **motivation** over time, especially when progress feels slow.\n\nFinally, **speaking and listening practice** can be intimidating. Learners may feel self-conscious about making mistakes, which can hinder conversation practice. Listening comprehension can also be difficult, especially when native speakers talk quickly or use slang.\n\nDespite these challenges, with persistence and the right resources, language learning can be an incredibly rewarding experience, opening doors to new cultures and opportunities.</input>", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "ef_level": 15.0, "label_accuracy": 0, "label_coherence": 0, "label_range": 0, "is_100_agreement": true}
