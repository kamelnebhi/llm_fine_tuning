Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Dear Harry,\n\nCongratulations for your promotion as a Manager.\n\nOne of the most important aspect of being a successful Manager is to have a high performance team.\n\nIn this sense, it is important to have the team motivated. A motivated team is a group that normally produces much more than a demotivated team. Also when you motivate a team it is willing to reach higher standards of quality. Consequently, the company benefits from motivated teams. Additionally, there are also clear benefits for each team member because when an individual has a good performance and a high level of excellence in the services or products where he is involved of his professional career will be enhanced by these skills giving him more opportunities to move forward for reaching a promotion.\n\nBut how can you have a team motivated? There are some key aspects to have into account:\n\n- Listen every team member of your team carefully. If each one realize that you are listening honestly and sympathetically to them then you will build trust on your team.\n\n- Work with your team on a collaborative way. It is not a micromanagement format it is all about how to help them to reach higher goals with your support.\n\n- Recognise their goals in public and reward them. It is not needed to give them more money, sometimes it would be enough with some extra days off, other times a costly and customized training would be more valuable from their perspective to feel rewarded.\n\n- Avoid things like: be angry, don’t praise people when they deserve. If you do these things make sure that you will have a demotivated team.\n\nGood luck with the challenge of having a motivated team.\n Correction: <input>Dear Harry,\n\nCongratulations <code a=\"PREP\" c=\"on\">for</code> your promotion <code a=\"PREP\" c=\"to\">as</code> <code a=\"DET\" c=\"\">a </code>Manager.\n\nOne of the most important <code a=\"NOUN:NUM\" c=\"aspects\">aspect</code> of being a successful <code a=\"ORTH\" c=\"manager\">Manager</code> is <code a=\"VERB:FORM\" c=\"having\">to have</code> a high<code a=\"PUNCT\" c=\"-\"></code>performance team.<code a=\"PHRA\" c=\" \">\n\n</code>In this sense, it is important to <code a=\"VERB\" c=\"keep\">have</code> the team motivated.

Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, metaphor, symbolism, and questioning stand out as the most useful to me. Metaphor allows for vivid comparisons that breathe life into writing, helping readers connect abstract ideas to tangible imagery. Symbolism, on the other hand, enriches writing by layering deeper meanings beneath the surface, making narratives more engaging and thought-provoking. These techniques are particularly valuable in creative writing, where emotional depth and layered interpretations enhance storytelling.\nAdditionally, questioning serves as a powerful tool to develop ideas and encourage critical thinking. By asking \"what if\" or \"why,\" writers can push their thoughts further, uncovering fresh perspectives and unexpected angles. This technique is incredibly effective when brainstorming or refining arguments in analytical writing.

I understand the urgency of making a decision.

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: An airplane is made up of several key parts, each serving a specific function to enable flight. The **fuselage** is the main body of the aircraft, housing the cockpit, passengers, and cargo. It provides structural support and connects all other components.\n\nThe **wings** are essential for generating lift. As air flows over and under the wings, their shape creates an upward force that allows the plane to rise and stay aloft. Wings may also contain fuel tanks and support devices like flaps and ailerons, which help control the aircraft's direction and stability.\n\nThe **tail**, or empennage, consists of the horizontal stabilizer and vertical fin. These structures help maintain balance and control. The horizontal stabilizer ensures pitch stability (up and down movement), while the vertical fin helps the plane maintain a straight course by stabilizing yaw (side-to-side movement).\n\nLastly, the **engines** provide the thrust needed for the airplane to move forward. Modern airplanes typically use jet engines or turboprops, which propel the aircraft and enable the wings to generate lift.\n\nTogether, these parts work in harmony to make flight possible.

{"orig_idx": 6880, "text": "Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Learning a new language is an exciting yet often difficult journey. Many students face challenges that can slow their progress or make them feel discouraged. One common issue is the fear of making mistakes, which can prevent learners from speaking or participating actively in class. This fear is often rooted in a desire to be perfect rather than focusing on communication.\n\nAnother major challenge is maintaining motivation. At first, learning a new language can feel fresh and rewarding. However, over time, students may feel stuck or frustrated when progress becomes less noticeable. To stay motivated, it helps to set small, realistic goals and celebrate each achievement.\n\nTime management is also a critical challenge. Language learning requires consistent practice, but many students struggle to balance it with other responsibilities. Creating a study routine and integrating language into daily life—such as watching foreign-language shows or journaling—can help.\n\nLastly, exposure to real-life language use is limited in classroom settings. Without regular opportunities to practice with native speakers, students may struggle with listening and speaking skills. Seeking language exchange partners or online communities can make a significant difference.\n\nIn conclusion, while language learning is challenging, identifying these obstacles and addressing them with practical strategies can lead to steady progress and greater confidence. Correction: <input>Learning a new language is an exciting yet often difficult journey. Many students face challenges that can slow their progress or make them feel discouraged. One common issue is the fear of making mistakes, which can prevent learners from speaking or participating actively in class. This fear is often rooted in a desire to be perfect rather than focusing on communication.\n\nAnother major challenge is maintaining motivation. At first, learning a new language can feel fresh and rewarding. However, over time, students may feel stuck or frustrated when progress becomes less noticeable. To stay motivated, it helps to set small, realistic goals and celebrate each achievement.\n\nTime management is also a critical challenge. Language learning requires consistent practice, but many students struggle to balance it with other responsibilities. Creating a study routine and integrating language into daily life—such as watching foreign-language shows or journaling—can help.\n\nLastly, exposure to real-life language use is limited in classroom settings. Without regular opportunities to practice with native speakers, students may struggle with listening and speaking skills. Seeking language exchange partners or online communities can make a significant difference.\n\nIn conclusion, while language learning is challenging, identifying these obstacles and addressing them with practical strategies can lead to steady progress and greater confidence.</input>", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5, "is_100_agreement": true}

If there are any leaks, cracks, or weaknesses, these should be repaired to prevent further damage and potential liability claims.\n\n2. **Fire Safety**: Make sure there are working smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and clear exit routes. You should also check if the building has an up-to-date fire alarm system.\n\n3. **Electrical Safety**: Have a licensed electrician inspect the wiring and ensure that everything meets current safety standards. Faulty wiring is a common cause of fires.\n\n4. **Security**: Install adequate lighting outside and consider an alarm system or CCTV to prevent theft or vandalism, which can impact your insurance.\n\n5. **Health and Safety**: Keep walkways clear of obstructions and ensure your store is compliant with any local health and safety regulations.\n\nAddressing these issues will not only make your shop safer but might also lower your insurance costs.

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: An airplane consists of several key parts that work together to ensure it can fly safely and efficiently. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane, providing space for passengers, cargo, and the cockpit where the pilots control the aircraft. It also serves as a structural frame that holds the other parts in place.\n\nThe wings are crucial for flight. They generate lift by moving air faster over the top surface than the bottom, creating an upward force that allows the plane to stay in the air. The shape and angle of the wings are carefully designed to provide the most efficient lift.\n\nThe tail of the airplane, also known as the empennage, consists of the horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer helps to keep the plane level and prevent pitching, while the vertical stabilizer controls the plane’s yaw, or side-to-side movement.\n\nFinally, the engines provide the thrust needed for the airplane to move forward. Most commercial airplanes use jet engines that take in air, compress it, mix it with fuel, and then expel it at high speed to propel the aircraft forward.\n\nEach of these parts works together to ensure the airplane can fly smoothly and safely.

Response: Applying for a mortgage in Argentina is nearly impossible. Due to the instability of our currency, banks do not offer mortgages. Moreover, people do not want to compromise their savings for twenty-five years as it is difficult to plan that far ahead.

Additionally, governments do not keep steady policies.  \n\nLet’s imagine that mortgages did exist here, and were accesible, there would still be uncertainty. Let’s say that you manage to obtain an interview with the bank to apply. The banker reviews your bank statements, credit rating, and employment history concluding that you might qualify for a loan. However, they tell you that property values are in US dollars and that the loan is in Argentinian pesos. Therefore, if it happens that in between the time the loan was processed and you actually purchase the house, the foreign currency rate between ARS and USD dramatically increase, it might happen that the loan will not be enough to pay the property and the bank will not take any responsibility for that.  \n\nDue to these facts and the government not promoting such loans, many people resign to rent an apartment permanently.

Response: Nafta Agreement ,\nThis article has the objective to explain the agreement done  among North America countries , I  mean USA , Canada and Mexico in order to stablish an economic condition eliminating tariffs in the commercial relations among them. \nI was done in 1994 after long negotiation period. So it was not easy agreement since each country involved hat specific requirements and intentions.\nDespite the difficulties and barries the agreement was signed by the membres. It in fact reduced or eliminated customs duties among the members facilitating the customers to have access to products among these countries at  lower prices without tariffs and aditional costs.\nIt has had a profound effect on trade relations, especially in agriculture; for example, Mexican fruits and vegetables flow into the US.

{"orig_idx": 15159, "text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a criticism of a celebrity. It can be a particular celebrity or the whole idea of celebrity in general. Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Criticism towards a celebrity often focuses on their personal behavior, public statements, artistic choices, or perceived lack of authenticity, with common criticisms including: unprofessional conduct, hypocrisy, offensive remarks, poor decision-making, excessive self-promotion, unrealistic portrayals, and a disconnect from real-life issues; however, the nature of criticism can vary depending on the celebrity and the context of the situation. \nKey aspects of celebrity criticism:\nPersonal life:\nCritics may scrutinize a celebrity's relationships, substance abuse issues, legal troubles, or family dynamics, sometimes considering their private life as a reflection of their character. \nPublic image:\nA celebrity's persona, particularly if perceived as carefully curated or inauthentic, can be a target for criticism, with accusations of being \"too perfect\" or not being true to themselves. \nSocial and political stances:\nWhen celebrities express strong opinions on social or political issues, they can face backlash from those who disagree with their views, especially if seen as opportunistic or uninformed. \nArtistic performance:\nActors, musicians, and other performers can be criticized for their acting skills, musical quality, or creative choices, with critiques focusing on technical aspects or the overall artistic direction. \nImpact on society:\nSome criticism focuses on the potential negative influence a celebrity might have on their fans, particularly regarding body image, consumerism, or unhealthy behaviors. \nExamples of celebrity criticism:\n\"Cancel culture\":\nA recent trend where celebrities face intense public backlash and potential career consequences for past actions or statements considered offensive or harmful. \n\"Unrealistic portrayals\":\nActors might be criticized for perpetuating unrealistic beauty standards or lifestyle expectations through their roles. \n\"Hypocrisy\":\nWhen a celebrity promotes a certain lifestyle or ethical values while engaging in behavior that contradicts those values. \nImportant considerations:\nPrivacy concerns:\nWhile celebrities often put themselves in the public eye, there are limits to what aspects of their personal life should be subject to criticism. \nConstructive criticism:\nCriticism can be valuable when it focuses on specific areas of improvement or raises important issues, rather than simply being personal attacks. \nMedia bias:\nThe way the media portrays a celebrity can influence public perception and sometimes lead to unfair or exaggerated criticism.

Use your own words where possible. Response: Media has changed a lot in my lifetime. When I was younger, printed magazines and television were the most important sources of news and entertainment. People waited for the evening news to find out what was happening in the world. Now, most media is digital: I use my phone, tablet, and computer to read the news, watch videos, and follow social media.

Still, I enjoy the variety and interactivity of digital content: I can comment, share, and connect with others easily.

Response: The writing techniques introduced in the preceding units have been invaluable in enhancing my writing skills.

Due to globalisation, there is a constant expectation from the organisations to promote not national interest but global interest as well. We know that the the organisation uses different resources which belongs to the society, so it is ultimate responsibility of the organisation due give something back to the society as whole, this can be in forms of education, like they can establish different educational institution where the children who are unprivileged can get good education. The organisation can set up hospital where they can provide health services to the needy people free of cost or at nominal fee along with free medicine and other services. The other way to contribute to the society is to build the good infrastructure like roadway or railways which can connect the remote location of the country to the developed cities or metropolitans. While utilising the natural resources it is very important that the organisation should be very careful in considering it adverse effect on the nature which will ultimately will impact the society as a whole in terms of increase in the land, noise or water pollutions.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become an integral part of modern business practices, reflecting a company's commitment to ethical behavior, sustainable development, and community engagement. The postings on this topic reveal a spectrum of opinions, ranging from enthusiastic support to skeptical criticism.\n\nProponents argue that CSR initiatives foster a positive public image, enhance customer loyalty, and attract top talent. Companies like Patagonia and Ben & Jerry's are often cited as exemplars, demonstrating that ethical practices can coexist with profitability. These businesses have successfully integrated environmental stewardship and social equity into their core operations, proving that CSR can be a win-win strategy for both the company and society.\n\nCritics, however, contend that CSR is often a facade, a marketing gimmick designed to distract from less savory business practices. They point to instances where companies engage in \"greenwashing,\" promoting environmentally friendly initiatives while continuing harmful practices behind the scenes. This skepticism underscores the need for transparency and accountability in CSR efforts.\n\nIn my view, CSR is not just a moral imperative but a strategic necessity in today's interconnected world. Companies wield significant influence and resources, and with that comes the responsibility to contribute positively to society. Effective CSR requires genuine commitment, clear goals, and measurable outcomes. It should be embedded in the company's culture and operations, rather than being treated as an afterthought or a mere public relations tool.\n\nUltimately, the true measure of CSR's success lies in its impact. When done right, CSR can drive meaningful change, fostering a more sustainable and equitable world while also benefiting the business itself. Therefore, companies should strive to move beyond superficial gestures and embrace CSR as a core component of their identity and strategy.

These businesses have successfully integrated environmental stewardship and social equity into their core operations, proving that CSR can be a win-win strategy for both the company and society.\n\nCritics, however, contend that CSR is often a facade, a marketing gimmick designed to distract from less savory business practices. They point to instances where companies engage in \"greenwashing,\" promoting environmentally friendly initiatives while continuing harmful practices behind the scenes. This skepticism underscores the need for transparency and accountability in CSR efforts.\n\nIn my view, CSR is not just a moral imperative but a strategic necessity in today's interconnected world. Companies wield significant influence and resources, and with that comes the responsibility to contribute positively to society. Effective CSR requires genuine commitment, clear goals, and measurable outcomes. It should be embedded in the company's culture and operations, rather than being treated as an afterthought or a mere public relations tool.\n\nUltimately, the true measure of CSR's success lies in its impact. When done right, CSR can drive meaningful change, fostering a more sustainable and equitable world while also benefiting the business itself. Therefore, companies should strive to move beyond superficial gestures and embrace CSR as a core component of their identity and strategy.</input>", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5, "is_100_agreement": true}

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: To create a motivated, engaged, and productive workforce, it is vital for leaders to take a strategic approach that aligns employees' personal and professional growth with the company's goals. By incentivizing employees and linking their success directly to the company's achievements, managers can create a sense of ownership and motivation, where individuals feel that their contributions directly impact their rewards and overall success. Additionally, taking an active interest in employees' career development and offering mentorship opportunities fosters a deeper connection between the individual and the organization, ensuring they feel supported in their professional journey. Providing opportunities for ongoing training and skill development ensures that employees are equipped with the tools they need to thrive, creating a culture of continuous improvement. It's equally important to promote a healthy work-life balance by recognizing that employees have lives outside of the workplace, and showing empathy toward their personal commitments will build loyalty and well-being. Listening actively to employees, especially when they raise concerns or express dissatisfaction, not only helps to address potential issues early on but also fosters a culture of trust where employees feel heard and valued.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: The debate around Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a crucial one, and in my opinion, companies absolutely have a responsibility to society that extends beyond merely maximizing profits for shareholders. While some argue a company's sole duty is to its investors, this perspective feels increasingly outdated. Businesses don't operate in a vacuum; they exist within communities, utilize shared resources, and rely on a healthy society for their workforce and consumer base. This interdependency creates an ethical obligation to contribute positively to the broader good.\n\nBeyond ethical considerations, CSR makes undeniable business sense. Consumers increasingly value and reward companies with strong social and environmental records, fostering loyalty and enhancing brand reputation. Furthermore, a genuine commitment to fair employee benefits and sustainable operations often leads to higher productivity, lower turnover, and a more engaged workforce. While some might view CSR spending as a mere marketing tactic, truly integrated efforts build long-term value and resilience, far surpassing any fleeting PR gains.\n\nUltimately, while governments certainly set regulations, responsible companies go beyond minimum compliance, proactively addressing societal challenges. Integrating social and environmental responsibility into core operations isn't just about doing good; it's about building a more reputable, sustainable, and ultimately more profitable future for all stakeholders involved.

While some might view CSR spending as a mere marketing tactic, truly integrated efforts build long-term value and resilience, far surpassing any fleeting PR gains.\n\nUltimately, while governments certainly set regulations, responsible companies go beyond minimum compliance, proactively addressing societal challenges. Integrating social and environmental responsibility into core operations isn't just about doing good; it's about building a more reputable, sustainable, and ultimately more profitable future for all stakeholders involved.</input>", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5, "is_100_agreement": true}

Write 150-200 words. Response: Case Overview: This case involves a tort action for trespassing where the plaintiff, Byron, accused the defendant, Medina, of unlawfully entering their home. The incident caused significant distress and terror to the Byron family. It was unclear whether Medina took any valuables, as there was no specific mention of items being stolen.\n\nDetails of the Case:\n\nPlaintiff's Position: Medina unlawfully entered the Byron family home, causing distress and terror.\nDefendant's Position: Medina claimed he believed the house was empty and was seeking shelter at night. He admitted to ransacking the house in the process.\nVerdict: The court found Medina guilty of trespassing, a criminal offense. The penalties imposed included a fine of $1,000, to be paid in two installments, with one payment to be made immediately. Additionally, Medina was sentenced to complete 300 hours of community service.\n\nCommentary on the Verdict: The verdict appears appropriate given the circumstances of the case. Trespassing is a criminal offense, and the court's decision to impose a monetary fine and community service is a reasonable punishment for Medina's unlawful entry and the distress caused to the Byron family. The sentencing takes into account Medina's actions while providing a rehabilitative component through community service, which may deter similar behavior in the future. The fine and community service collectively serve as a punitive measure and a means of restitution for the disturbance caused by the trespass.

Response: Issues and Challenges Language Students Often Face\n\nWhy is learning a new language difficult for many students? One major challenge is mastering pronunciation and listening skills. Different sounds, accents, and speech speeds can confuse learners, especially when they differ significantly from their native language.\n\nAnother issue is vocabulary retention. How can students remember hundreds or thousands of new words? Without regular practice, new vocabulary is quickly forgotten. Grammar rules add another layer of complexity. Why are grammar rules so frustrating? Because they often include many exceptions and may not match the student’s native language structure.\n\nWhat about confidence? Many students fear making mistakes in front of others. This fear of embarrassment can stop them from speaking, even if they know the correct words. Motivation is another challenge. Why do some students give up? Progress may seem slow, especially without immediate rewards or real-life practice.\n\nFinally, lack of exposure is a common problem. Without daily interaction in the language, it’s hard to develop fluency. Watching shows, talking to native speakers, or traveling can help—but not everyone has those opportunities.\n\nIn summary, language learners face difficulties with pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, confidence, motivation, and exposure.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The Nortn America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed in 1994 after many years of negotiation between the parties.\nU.S.A., Canada and Mexico are the members of the Nafta agreement.\nIt allows each of these countries to export their goods without the application of import duties and many of their economic activies took a great benefit.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: NAFTA, or the North American Free Trade Agreement, is a trilateral trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It officially came into force in January 1994 after years of negotiation. Its main objective was to reduce or eliminate customs duties and trade barriers between the three countries, thereby encouraging economic cooperation and integration.\n\nThe agreement has had a significant impact on trade relations, especially in sectors like agriculture. For instance, since NAFTA was implemented, the United States has seen a notable increase in the import of Mexican fruits and vegetables, which has benefited consumers and expanded market opportunities for Mexican farmers.\n\nDespite its many advantages, NAFTA has also had some negative consequences, such as job losses in certain manufacturing sectors due to companies relocating to countries with lower labor costs. However, the overall impact has been largely positive, fostering economic growth and increasing trade volume among the member nations.\n\nIn summary, NAFTA has played a key role in shaping North American economic relations, proving beneficial to all three countries involved by promoting free trade and stronger regional ties.\n Correction: <input>NAFTA, or the North American Free Trade Agreement, is a trilateral trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
