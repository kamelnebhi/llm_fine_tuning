{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find metaphor and questioning to be the most useful. Metaphors are powerful because they allow me to express abstract ideas in a more tangible, relatable way. By comparing one thing to another, I can deepen understanding and make my writing more vivid. For instance, saying “her smile was a beacon of hope” conveys emotion and imagery in a way that’s more engaging than simply stating “she smiled.” This ability to evoke feelings and images makes metaphor especially valuable in creative writing and persuasive pieces.\n\nQuestioning is another technique I frequently use, especially in brainstorming or problem-solving. Asking \"what if\" or \"why\" helps me explore ideas from different angles, uncover deeper meanings, or drive the plot forward. It also opens up the conversation, whether I’m writing an essay, a story, or even a dialogue. Together, metaphor and questioning help me clarify my thoughts and express them in a more engaging, thoughtful manner, making my writing both clearer and more dynamic.\n Correction: <input>Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find metaphor and questioning to be the most useful.

Paris, my favorite city, is a place where history and beauty merge effortlessly. The city is renowned for its romantic charm, from the grand boulevards to the intimate cafés lining the Seine River. Paris’s architecture is a blend of classical grandeur and modern artistry—monuments like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum stand as symbols of France’s rich cultural history, while contemporary structures like the Fondation Louis Vuitton add a touch of innovation. Strolling through neighborhoods like Le Marais or Montmartre, with their cobblestone streets and boutique shops, evokes a sense of timeless elegance and artistic inspiration.\n\nIn contrast, Tokyo represents a fascinating contrast, where centuries-old traditions exist side-by-side with the cutting-edge modernity of technology and urban design. The skyline, filled with towering skyscrapers, is a testament to the city’s rapid growth, while ancient temples such as Senso-ji provide serene sanctuaries amidst the city’s hustle and bustle. Tokyo’s efficient public transportation system, with its punctual trains and sprawling subway network, makes it easy to navigate the sprawling metropolis.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Read the class assignment. Then write your response on the class discussion board. Remember to take a stand on the proposal and support your position with reasons and examples. Type in the input box. Write 45-70 words. Use your own words where possible. Response: I am strongly opposed to the proposal to cut physical education and sports classes in favor of test preparation classes for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, physical education and sports play a crucial role in the overall development of students. They provide essential benefits beyond physical health, including improved mental health, better focus, and stress reduction. Engaging in physical activities helps students develop teamwork and leadership skills, which are crucial for their personal and professional lives. Removing these classes could negatively impact students' well-being and social development.\n\nSecondly, while test preparation is important, dedicating three hours a week throughout the entire year to test prep could lead to burnout and diminish enthusiasm for learning. Students need a balanced education that includes both academic and physical activities. Overemphasizing test preparation may lead to a narrow focus on test-taking skills rather than a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.\n\nMoreover, numerous studies have shown that a well-rounded education, which includes physical education, contributes to better academic performance. Physical activity has been linked to improved concentration, memory, and classroom behavior, which can, in turn, enhance test performance. Therefore, cutting sports and physical education could inadvertently undermine the very goal the proposal aims to achieve.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention to improve test scores is understandable, eliminating physical education and sports is not the right approach. Instead, schools should strive for a balanced curriculum that supports both academic excellence and the physical and mental well-being of students.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: One major criticism of celebrity culture is that it often promotes superficial values rather than meaningful achievements. To be honest, many celebrities are famous not because of talent or hard work, but simply because of their appearance or social media presence. It seems that in today’s world, being loud or controversial is more important than being knowledgeable or kind. What’s more, celebrities are frequently treated as experts on topics they know little about, such as politics or science, which can be misleading. Another problem is that celebrity lifestyles set unrealistic standards. They give the impression that success means luxury, fame, and constant attention, which is not only inaccurate but also harmful, especially for young people. Frankly speaking, it’s hard to respect a system that rewards popularity over substance. While there are certainly celebrities who use their platform for good, the overall culture often feels shallow and unbalanced. It would be better if society valued real contributions more than likes and followers.\n Correction: <input>One major criticism of celebrity culture is that it often promotes superficial values rather than meaningful achievements.

Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a trilateral trade bloc formed by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, aimed at reducing or eliminating customs duties and trade barriers among its member states. Implemented on January 1, 1994, NAFTA has significantly impacted trade relations, particularly in agriculture.\n\nNAFTA led to the immediate elimination of tariffs on over half of Mexico's exports to the US and over a third of US exports to Mexico. The agreement phased out tariffs on US-Mexico trade within 10-15 years, fostering increased trade volumes. NAFTA boosted agricultural trade, with Mexico becoming a significant importer of US agricultural products. NAFTA benefited North American economies, increasing productivity and competitiveness.\n\nSome industries, like manufacturing, experienced job losses due to increased competition.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: To create a comparison and contrast between my favorite place and another city, I'll choose Kyoto, Japan, as my favorite place and contrast it with New York City, USA.\n\nKyoto, Japan vs. New York City, USA\n\nCultural Heritage and Atmosphere:\n\nKyoto: Known for its rich cultural heritage, Kyoto is often considered the heart of traditional Japan. It is home to numerous ancient temples, shrines, and traditional wooden houses. The city exudes a serene and contemplative atmosphere, with picturesque landscapes and well-preserved historical sites, such as Kinkaku-ji (the Golden Pavilion) and Fushimi Inari Shrine. The city’s atmosphere is tranquil, offering a respite from the hustle and bustle of modern life.\nNew York City: In contrast, New York City is a global hub of modernity and diversity, often referred to as \"The City That Never Sleeps.\" It is characterized by its towering skyscrapers, bustling streets, and vibrant cultural scene. NYC is rich in contemporary art, theater, and music, with iconic landmarks like Times Square, Central Park, and the Statue of Liberty. The city's atmosphere is energetic and fast-paced, attracting people from all over the world.\nSize and Population:\n\nKyoto: Kyoto is a relatively small city compared to New York, with a population of about 1.5 million people. The city's size makes it more navigable and offers a sense of intimacy and community. It's easier to explore on foot or by bicycle, allowing residents and visitors to immerse themselves in the local culture.\nNew York City: NYC is one of the largest cities in the world, with a population exceeding 8 million. Its sheer size and density contribute to its vibrant and dynamic nature. The city is divided into five boroughs, each with its own distinct character, making it a melting pot of cultures and experiences.\nEconomy and Opportunities:\n\nKyoto: While Kyoto has a strong local economy, particularly in tourism and traditional crafts, it does not offer the same level of business opportunities as larger metropolitan areas. The economy is more focused on preserving cultural heritage and supporting local industries.\nNew York City: Known as a financial powerhouse, NYC is a global economic leader, offering vast opportunities in finance, media, fashion, technology, and more. Wall Street is the epicenter of global finance, and the city attracts professionals seeking career advancement and networking opportunities.\nLifestyle and Living Costs:\n\nKyoto: Living in Kyoto can be more affordable than in major global cities, with a slower pace of life. The cost of living is moderate, and residents often enjoy a balanced lifestyle with access to nature, such as the nearby Arashiyama Bamboo Grove or the Philosopher's Path.\nNew York City: NYC is known for its high cost of living, with expensive housing and daily expenses. The fast-paced lifestyle can be both exhilarating and exhausting, with endless entertainment options and a 24/7 urban experience.\nConclusion:\nKyoto and New York City each offer unique experiences and attractions. Kyoto is ideal for those who appreciate history, tradition, and a peaceful environment, while New York City appeals to those who thrive in a dynamic, cosmopolitan atmosphere. Both cities, in their own ways, capture the essence of their respective cultures and provide enriching experiences for residents and visitors alike.

Additionally, taking an active interest in your employees' career paths by offering training and mentorship will show that you care about their growth and development.\n\nA healthy work-life balance is also essential. Recognizing that employees have personal lives outside of work will help reduce burnout and increase overall satisfaction. Listening to your employees is another vital point; people feel valued when they are heard, even if they are voicing complaints. Moreover, treating your subordinates with respect and empathy fosters a positive environment where everyone feels supported.\n\nOn the flip side, here are some things to avoid that could demotivate your staff: disrespecting subordinates, taking credit for their work, losing your temper, allowing unfair blame, and failing to acknowledge good work.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful!

{"text": "Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: An airplane is composed of several key components, each serving a specific function to ensure flight and stability. The fuselage is the central body of the airplane, designed to accommodate passengers, cargo, and the cockpit. It provides structural support and is streamlined to minimize air resistance.\n\nThe wings are critical for flight, as they generate lift by interacting with the airflow. The shape of the wings, known as the airfoil, helps create a pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces, allowing the airplane to ascend and remain airborne. Wings also house the ailerons and flaps, which assist in controlling roll and adjusting lift during takeoff and landing.\n\nThe tail of an airplane, also known as the empennage, includes the vertical and horizontal stabilizers. The vertical stabilizer, or fin, prevents yawing, which is the side-to-side motion of the aircraft. Attached is the rudder, used to steer the aircraft left or right. The horizontal stabilizer assists in maintaining pitch stability, with the elevators attached to control the ascent and descent.\n\nEngines are the powerhouses of the airplane, providing the thrust necessary to propel it forward. They can be mounted on the wings or the fuselage and are crucial for generating the speed required for lift-off and sustaining flight. Together, these parts work in harmony to achieve controlled and efficient aviation.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: The main parts of an airplane and their functions:\n\n1. Fuselage: The fuselage is the main body of the airplane. It houses the cockpit, where the pilots sit, as well as the passenger cabin and cargo area. It provides structural support and connects all the other parts of the airplane.\n\n2. Wings: The wings are crucial for flight. They generate lift, which allows the airplane to rise off the ground. The shape of the wings is designed to create a pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces, resulting in lift. Wings also house the fuel tanks and sometimes the landing gear.\n\n3. Tail: The tail consists of the horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer helps maintain the airplane's pitch (up and down movement), while the vertical stabilizer controls the yaw (side-to-side movement). Together, they provide stability and control in flight.\n\n4. Engines: The engines provide the thrust needed to propel the airplane forward. They work by expelling a high-speed jet of air or exhaust gases, which pushes the airplane in the opposite direction. Modern airplanes typically use jet engines, which are highly efficient and powerful. Correction: <input>The main parts of an airplane and their functions:\n\n1.

Response: Developing leadership qualities is a journey that takes time, self-awareness, and a willingness to grow. From my experience, leadership starts with taking responsibility not just for yourself, but for the people around you. I remember leading a small project in school where we had to organize an event.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Metaphor and hyperbole have both been incredibly useful to me in enhancing the way I express thoughts and emotions. Metaphors allow me to draw comparisons between seemingly unrelated things, making abstract ideas more relatable and vivid. For example, when I describe anxiety as a “storm in my chest,” it paints a clearer picture of the emotional turmoil I feel, allowing others to better understand my experience. Metaphors also help bring creativity and depth to my writing, making it more engaging and meaningful. On the other hand, hyperbole, or deliberate exaggeration, has helped me emphasize strong feelings or situations in a dramatic and memorable way. Saying “I’ve told you a million times” might not be literally true, but it powerfully conveys frustration or impatience. Hyperbole grabs attention and often adds humor or intensity to what I’m communicating. Together, these techniques have improved both my spoken and written communication, helping me to express myself more clearly, connect with others emotionally, and leave a lasting impression.

Response: The techniques useful for me is free writing, loop righting and listing and can be used depending upon the instances. Looping is a freewriting technique that allows you to focus your ideas continually while trying to discover a writing topic. After you freewrite for the first time, identify a key thought or idea in your writing, and begin to freewrite again, with that idea as your starting point.\nFree writing is probably the most common and talked up strategy for getting your writing going.\n\nFree writing is when you write continuously without stopping.

But free writing is often advocated for hesitant writers who feel anxious – at the start of a project, in the middle and at the end.

Write 150-200 words. Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was established to promote trade among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Officially coming into effect in January 1994 after years of negotiations, NAFTA aimed to reduce or eliminate customs duties and trade barriers between the three countries. To be more specific, what this meant was that goods could be traded with fewer restrictions and fostering economic cooperation.\nOne of the most significant impacts of NAFTA has been on agriculture. For example, Mexican fruits and vegetables now flow into the U.S. market at lower prices. To elaborate, this provided U.S. consumers with more variety and affordable options. In other words, NAFTA boosted agricultural trade, benefiting all parties involved. Additionally, the agreement spurred industrial growth, particularly in Mexico, which became a manufacturing hub for the U.S. and Canada.\nHowever, there were also negative consequences. To put it another way, jobs were lost in certain manufacturing sectors in the U.S. and Canada as companies relocated to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: \nIt was in the 1960s when an American avant-garde artist called Andy Warhol made a chillingly accurate prediction that everybody would be famous for 15 minutes. He originally said we would all be world-famous, but with the passage of time this expression has gone through paraphrases and permutations. But long before the birth of reality TV shows, social networking sites and blogs, live phone-in and emails to major news networks while they are on air, here was a man whose own interest in fame and celebrity culture inspired him to predict what was to come to pass in our lifetime.\n\nAt one time, you became famous by being a hero, by doing something so unusual or worthy that it made the rest of us gasp in wonder; think of the astronauts who took those first small steps for man, those giant leaps for mankind. Fame of a different kind comes with the territory for the successful, the beautiful, the talented and, lest we forget, the notorious. Gossip columnists and tabloid hacks feed the frenzy of the 24-hour ‘news’ machines we have created; increasingly the lines between the roles the rock stars and the mega-movie moguls play and the lives they live off-camera become blurred.

People tune in nightly to see pseudo-news reporters updating us with all the latest gossip and trivia. Movie stars, musicians, politicians and even the captains of industry are all fair game. If life mirrors art, here we see entertainment gossip programs posturing none too piously as news programs, casting themselves in the image of CNN and producing ‘edutainment.’\n\nBut what of Andy Warhol’s prediction? TV and technology have, in recent years, helped democratize celebrity culture to such an extent that now all of us can join this club by becoming ‘accidental celebrities.’ If we just happen to be present at the time of a significant event, choose to appear in a reality program, or post ourselves on YouTube, our 15 minutes of fame has been ordered.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: Buying a home in India involves a series of steps, beginning with determining your budget and preferred location. Housing prices vary significantly across cities; for instance, in 2023, prices in Mumbai or Delhi are higher compared to cities like Pune or Bangalore. Typically, residential property prices in prime areas range from ₹10,000 to ₹30,000 per square foot, while suburban areas may offer more affordable options.\n\nOnce a property is chosen, applying for a home loan is a common step. The loan application process involves submitting documents such as identity proof, income proof, and property details. Banks assess eligibility based on credit score, income, and repayment capacity. Home loan interest rates in India fluctuate between 6.5% to 9%, influenced by economic conditions and RBI policies.\n\nReal estate brokers play a crucial role in navigating the property market. They provide expertise in finding suitable properties, negotiating prices, and handling paperwork. Brokers charge a commission, typically 1-2% of the property's sale price, which can vary depending on the region and the services offered.\n\nIn summary, buying a home in India requires careful planning, from understanding market prices to securing a home loan. Engaging with a broker can simplify the process, though it adds to the overall cost. Prospective buyers must consider current interest rates and market trends to make informed decisions.

Pay attention to your use of commas, colons and semicolons. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. Response: Media has changed drastically over the course of my lifetime. In the past, traditional media such as newspapers, magazines, and television played a central role in how people consumed information. I remember watching the evening news with my family and reading printed newspapers to stay updated on current events. Now, however, I rely mostly on digital media—especially news apps, social media platforms, and online articles. This shift has not only changed the format of media but also transformed my reading habits. Instead of reading long-form articles or full newspapers, I now tend to scan headlines, summaries, and quick posts; this allows me to absorb a large amount of information in a short period of time. As a result, my attention span has shortened, and I find it harder to concentrate on lengthy content. On the other hand, I can now personalize the kind of news I see—choosing topics and sources that interest me most. In short: media has become more convenient, immediate, and interactive; however, it has also made deep, focused reading more difficult.

Write the **strategic summary** and **risk assessment** sections of the proposal using the notes. Write 140–200 words. Response: GENERAL INFO\n\nProposal submitted to: NH HOTELS\nJob name: Zen, a 'boutique' hotel in the North Islands of the Netherlands\nProposed by: CB Innovation\nContact: Carmen Bernal, Creative Manager (carmen.bernal@CBInnovation.com) \n\nPROPOSAL \nCB Innovation proposes the development of a Boutique hotel in the North islands of the Netherlands where tourists and local citizens can spend the day in the spa or fitness center,  enjoy a healthy menu in the restaurants or spend the night in a Zen and relaxing environment. The total investment is $4 million. \nSTRATEGIC SUMMARY\nMarket research performed by Accomdata Group showed that we have found a niche in the market. It is shown that there is growing trend in weekend getaways to relaxing resorts with greater attention to healthy lifestyle. In addition to this the North Islands do not offer a option like this so it is a great business opportunity in this area. The North Islands are the perfect natural place to allocate a business like this. Besides, a survey realized by Accomdata showed the customer unsatisfaction about the cuisine quality in most fitness centers. In this regard, the construction of renowned restaurants that offers healthy menu with top chefs and fully equipped gyms and swimming pools with trained instructors are the perfect combination for this Boutique Hotel. \nWe estimate a construction time of two years and forecast estimated time for recouping investment of four years from opening and profit starting five years from opening. The return of investment must start the second year after opening and the projected profit per year of $1 million after the second year.  \nRISK ASSESSMENT\nWe have factored any possible economic downturn into the above figures. Our projected figures indicate that If the economy remains stable, the period required for recouping investment and realizing profits could be cut in half.\nWe have already engaged  Kudos Advertising Agency to plan an intensive media campaign to promote the project since the early beginning. \n Correction: <input><code a=\"PHRA\" c=\"**\">GENERAL INFO\n\nProposal submitted to: NH HOTELS\nJob name: Zen, a 'boutique' hotel in the North Islands of the Netherlands\nProposed by: CB Innovation\nContact: Carmen Bernal, Creative Manager (carmen.bernal@CBInnovation.com) \n\nPROPOSAL \nCB Innovation proposes the development of a Boutique hotel in the North islands of the Netherlands where tourists and local citizens can spend the day in the spa or fitness center,  enjoy a healthy menu in the restaurants or spend the night in a Zen and relaxing environment.

In the past, traditional media such as newspapers, radio, and television were the primary sources of information and entertainment.

This shift has made information more accessible and instantaneous, allowing me to stay updated in real-time. My reading habits have also changed: I now prefer short, concise articles and videos over lengthy newspaper articles. The convenience of digital media has made it easier to consume content on the go, but it has also led to a preference for quick, bite-sized information.

This technique involves writing freely on a topic and then circling back to earlier points, refining them as I go.

The survey aimed to gauge consumer opinions across various demographics in both cities.\nSurvey Methodology:\nA sample of 1000 individuals was interviewed in each city. The primary objective was to assess the public’s reception of the collarless dress shirt, with a focus on their approval, purchase intent, and specific preferences or concerns.\nResults:\nRio de Janeiro (1000 Participants):\n•\tApproval Rate: 35% \no\tWould Buy: 20%\n•\tDisapproval Rate: 65%\nShanghai (1000 Participants):\n•\tApproval Rate: 80% \no\tWould Buy: 40%\n•\tDisapproval Rate: 20%\nFor the 65% of participants in Rio who did not approve, the key reasons were:\n•\tDesign Issues\n•\tSize Concerns\n•\tColor Preferences\n•\tMaterial Quality\nFor the 20% of participants in Shanghai who did not approve, the reasons were similar.\n\nFor the 20% in Rio and the 40% in Shangai who would purchase the collarless dress shirt, their satisfaction was moderate.

Write 150-200 words. Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a trade deal between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, implemented on January 1, 1994. Its primary goal was to eliminate trade barriers, such as tariffs and import quotas, to encourage economic cooperation among the three nations. By removing these restrictions, NAFTA aimed to boost trade, create jobs, and enhance economic growth across North America.\n\nNAFTA significantly increased trade between the member countries, particularly in industries like agriculture, automobiles, and manufacturing. However, the agreement faced criticism for causing job losses in certain sectors, particularly in the U.S., as some companies relocated production to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs. Environmental and labor concerns also arose, prompting debates about the agreement’s overall impact.\n\nIn 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which introduced updates to labor laws, environmental regulations, and digital trade rules. The USMCA aimed to address some of NAFTA’s shortcomings while maintaining the core benefits of free trade among the three countries.\n\nDespite its controversies, NAFTA played a significant role in shaping North American trade and economic relations for over 25 years.

Being the last person leaving office seemed a normal for the hardworking Lilian, although she occasionally complained about how tedious the job was.\n\nWe became close friends when finding out we shared the same hobby: knitting. Since we were both novice knitters, we joined a knitting club which hosts Afternoon Tea & Knitting meetups. Leaning from more experienced knitters, Lilian improved fast, and she became undoubtfully committed to the knitting club, “a second home” said by her. \n\nA year later, Lilian shared her first self-designed sweater pattern in the biggest knitting website Ralvery. It immediately hit the trend and was downloaded thousand times within a week, even though Lilian was still an amateur designer. The surprising success got her motivated, she invested all her spare time in designing and test-knitting. Thanks to her good knowledge with data and analytics, grading a sweater was a cup of tea, and she furthered her education on creating size-inclusive patterns. \n\nHer portfolio of self-designed knitwear patterns was growing. The patterns listed on Ralvery were priced from 6 to10 euros, and the popularity started to bring her a significant cashflow. One day, she asked me for a lunch date, “I want to say a proper goodbye to you… I quitted my job yesterday, as I am going to be a professional knitwear designer.” Lilian smiled. \n\nI am amazed to see how Lilian changed her career, derived from a hobby. Passion and persistent learning are the two most important ingredients in Lilian’s recipe. Now she is traveling in Nordics with her knitting bags full of yarns and needles. Her postcard told me she just started to learn how to spin wools. I cannot wait to meet Lilian again, who is a happy entrepreneur living in her best time.

Response: Comparison of New York City and Los Angeles\n\nNew York City and Los Angeles are two of the most iconic cities in the United States, but they offer very different lifestyles. New York City is known for its fast-paced environment and towering skyscrapers. The city is bustling 24/7, and there's always something to do, whether it's exploring Broadway shows, visiting museums, or simply walking through the busy streets. The energy of the city is contagious, and people often rely on public transportation to get around due to the city's compact nature.\n\nIn contrast, Los Angeles presents a more laid-back atmosphere. While it is a major urban hub, its sprawling layout and car-centric culture create a more relaxed vibe compared to New York. The city is famous for its entertainment industry, with Hollywood being the heart of the film and television world. The sunny weather and proximity to beautiful beaches also make Los Angeles a more outdoor-oriented city, with residents enjoying activities like hiking, surfing, or relaxing by the ocean.\n\nWhile New York thrives on its density and constant activity, Los Angeles shines with its open spaces and focus on leisure.

Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Dear Harry, first of all: \"A warm welcome\" to our Company!\" and thank you for asking me suggestions about how to better deal with your subordinates. In my opinion the main thing is to treat everyone with respect, regardless the hierarchy, and to listen to them even when they are complaining. Another advice is to make them feel part of the Company and that the Company really cares of them and their wellbeing, since Company's success depends on their individual contribution. This is because it is important that they are rewarded for their job when they achieve results, and that they have a good work-life balance too. Do not be afraid of offering training to them when needed to improve their performances, act as their mentor. I am sure they will be grateful to you in the future and this can help build up a stronger professional relationship and willingness to cooperate with you. Should you instead take credit for work done by them, or blame them for mistakes that are your responsibility, then I am afraid you would lose their trust and exsteem and working together everyday could become a real struggle.

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Language learning is a rewarding but often challenging journey. Many students face common obstacles that can slow their progress or affect their motivation. One major issue is lack of confidence—learners often fear making mistakes, especially when speaking. This fear can prevent them from practicing, which is essential for improvement.\n\nAnother challenge is limited exposure to the target language. Without regular interaction—through conversation, media, or reading—students may struggle to retain vocabulary and grammar. This leads to frustration and a sense of stagnation.\n\nMotivation is also a key factor. Language learning takes time, and without clear goals or engaging methods, students may lose interest. How can learners stay motivated? Setting small, achievable goals and celebrating progress can help.\n\nGrammar complexity and pronunciation difficulties are technical hurdles. Some languages have rules that differ greatly from a learner’s native tongue, making it hard to adapt. How can students overcome this? Practice, patience, and using the language in real-life contexts are crucial.\n\nFinally, lack of personalized learning can be a barrier. Not all students learn the same way.

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Language learning can be both exciting and challenging. One common issue students face is motivation. It's easy to start with enthusiasm, but as time goes on, it can be difficult to maintain that drive, especially when progress feels slow. So, how can learners stay motivated? Setting small, achievable goals and celebrating progress can help.\n\nAnother challenge is the fear of making mistakes. Many students hesitate to speak for fear of sounding incorrect or awkward. This fear can lead to avoidance of conversation practice, which is crucial for improvement. To overcome this, creating a supportive and non-judgmental learning environment can make a significant difference.\n\nAdditionally, mastering pronunciation and accent is often difficult. Sounds in a new language may not exist in the student's native tongue, making it tricky to pronounce words correctly. What strategies can help with this? Listening to native speakers, practicing regularly, and using language learning apps can be effective.\n\nFinally, understanding cultural context is key. Language isn't just about words; it's about communication styles, gestures, and social norms. Students should be encouraged to explore the culture associated with the language to enhance their understanding and fluency.\n\nBy addressing these challenges thoughtfully, language learners can make steady progress and enjoy the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Correction: <input>Language learning can be both exciting and challenging.

The fuselage is the main body of the airplane, housing the cockpit, passengers, and cargo.

This lift allows the airplane to rise off the ground and stay airborne. The shape and design of the wings are essential for controlling the aircraft's stability and maneuverability.\n\nThe tail consists of the horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer helps maintain the airplane's pitch, preventing it from tipping forward or backward.

This isn’t just a continuation—it’s a recognition of the trust we’ve rebuilt. In fact, they specifically praised our dedication to quality, which speaks volumes about the progress we’ve made.\n\nOf course, this success didn’t come without its challenges. Just three months ago, we were facing a series of unresolved defects that threatened to undermine our credibility. On top of that, we encountered a few smaller technical hiccups that added to the pressure.\n\nHowever, rather than letting these issues define us, we used them as a catalyst for change. We rethought how we deliver updates, making the process more reliable and responsive. At the same time, we strengthened our Quality Assurance practices to catch problems earlier.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in my country can be both exciting and overwhelming. The process involves several steps, and while it's possible to do everything independently, many people choose to work with a real estate agent and mortgage broker to simplify the process. Real estate agents help find suitable properties, while mortgage brokers assist in securing the best loan terms by comparing various lenders.\n\nThe application process for a home loan can be time-consuming and requires a lot of paperwork. You’ll need to provide proof of income, tax returns, employment history, and details of any existing debts. Additionally, lenders typically require a down payment, which can range from 10% to 20% of the home’s value, depending on the type of loan and your creditworthiness. It’s also common to fill out several forms, including loan applications and consent forms for credit checks, which can be overwhelming for first-time buyers.\n\nHousing prices, especially in urban areas, can be expensive, making it harder for many people to enter the market. In recent years, property prices have increased, and affordability has become a significant concern. Interest rates can vary but are usually around 3% to 5% for a fixed-rate mortgage, depending on the loan’s duration and the buyer’s financial situation. While it’s not mandatory to hire a real estate agent or mortgage broker, doing so can make the process smoother, especially for those who are unfamiliar with the real estate market.\n\n\n\n Correction: <input>Buying a home and applying for a home loan in my country can be both exciting and overwhelming.

You have some notes and a graph as your guide. Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. Response: Hang Seng Index Shows Robust Growth, Driven by Mainland China Investment\n\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI), Hong Kong's key stock market benchmark, has displayed impressive growth over the past six months, largely fueled by substantial investments from Mainland China. After a drop to 20,956 points six months ago, the index has surged to a high of 27,499 points, reflecting a remarkable recovery and upward momentum.\nThis growth has been particularly strong in the Properties and Utilities sub-indices, sectors that have benefited from China’s economic expansion. As Mainland China continues to invest heavily in Hong Kong, these sectors have become major drivers of the index's performance.\nLooking ahead, experts are optimistic about the HSI's prospects. They predict that the index will continue to rise in the coming year, supported by both foreign investments and growing domestic demand within Hong Kong. As the global economy stabilizes and international investors turn their attention to the region, the Hang Seng Index is poised for further gains, making it an attractive option for those seeking exposure to the dynamic Asian markets. \nWith Mainland China’s influence and a favorable economic outlook, the future of the HSI looks promising.

Response: In recent years, robots have increasingly become integral to various sectors in my country, from manufacturing to healthcare. In factories, industrial robots perform repetitive tasks with precision and efficiency, resulting in higher productivity and reduced production costs. In the field of healthcare, robots assist in surgeries, ensuring greater accuracy and minimizing recovery time for patients. Additionally, service robots are being deployed in hotels and restaurants to enhance customer experience. While these advancements bring substantial benefits, such as improved efficiency and safety, they also raise concerns about job displacement. Many workers fear that automation may lead to unemployment, particularly in low-skilled positions. Moreover, the increasing reliance on robots might make society overly dependent on technology.

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Learning a new language is a rewarding yet challenging experience. Many language learners face common issues that can hinder their progress. One of the most significant challenges is motivation. Consistency is key in language learning, but maintaining interest over time can be difficult, especially when progress seems slow or when faced with the complexities of grammar and pronunciation.\n\nAnother issue is the fear of making mistakes. Many learners hesitate to speak because they fear they will sound incorrect or be misunderstood. This fear can lead to a lack of practice, which, in turn, slows down improvement. Overcoming this fear requires a shift in mindset, focusing on communication rather than perfection.\n\nAdditionally, the learning environment plays a crucial role. Without immersion or constant exposure to the language, learners may struggle to retain vocabulary or develop fluency. This can be particularly challenging for those who do not live in a country where the language is spoken. Language learners must be creative in finding ways to surround themselves with the language, such as through movies, music, or online conversations with native speakers.\n\nLastly, differences in cultural context can be a barrier. Understanding the culture behind a language is essential for full comprehension and communication. Without this understanding, learners might miss out on nuances or idiomatic expressions that are crucial for mastering a language.\n\nBy addressing these challenges, learners can improve their language skills and stay motivated throughout the journey.\n\n\n Correction: <input>Learning a new language is a rewarding yet challenging experience.
