One evening, my friend Alex was out for a jog in the park when something strange happened. As he was running near the pond, he stumbled upon an old, weathered box half-buried in the dirt. Curious, he decided to open it, revealing a collection of odd, antique trinkets. Among them was a faded photograph of a woman he didn’t recognize, holding a strange key. Just as he was about to leave, he heard a faint whisper from behind. Turning around, no one was there.

Feeling unnerved, Alex left the park, but as he walked home, he noticed the photograph in his pocket. It wasn’t there before. At that moment, a chill ran down his spine. What had he gotten himself into? The next day, the box and the photograph were gone. All that remained was the key, now mysteriously tucked in his jacket.

Last month, something very interesting happened to my friend Riya. She was going to visit her aunt in another city and had to catch an early morning train. When she reached the station, she saw a small puppy sitting alone near the ticket counter. It looked scared and hungry.

Riya loves animals, so she bought some biscuits and gave them to the puppy. Then, something surprising happened. The puppy started following her everywhere — even onto the train! The train guard saw this and smiled. He said, “Looks like you have a new travel partner!”

Riya didn’t know what to do, but the other passengers were kind. They helped her take care of the puppy during the journey. When she reached her aunt’s house, she decided to keep the puppy and named him “Lucky.”

Now, Lucky is a happy part of her family. That one small moment at the station changed both their lives. Correction: <input>A Strange Day at the Train Station

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Firstly, celebrities use social media and put out controversial content. The content they post gets a lot of attention due to the inappropriate message.
They aren’t fake as human beings but as how they are presented to the world. Women and sometimes men whine about how they hate a part of their body or how ugly they are. Everyone wants something they don’t have. They look at celebrities as flawless human beings who have amazing features. What people always forget is that what they see on magazines or on TV is airbrushed and edited. There are many young girls who look up to the top models and actresses who are known for being very beautiful individuals. They wish to be like the celebrities they see on billboards.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: As there were a few problems with Cessna 123's landing, you have been asked to write a report by your superiors. Write the report below. Write 100 - 150 words. Response: On June 15, 2025, Cessna 123 experienced minor complications during its landing at Springfield Regional Airport. During final approach, the aircraft encountered unexpected crosswind gusts up to 18 knots, which affected alignment with Runway 27. The aircraft made a hard landing, resulting in a bounce and a brief veer to the left before the pilot regained full control. No injuries were reported, and the aircraft taxied safely to the gate.

Preliminary checks suggest possible minor issues with the nose gear shock absorption system. Weather conditions were within operational limits, but the gusts were stronger than forecasted. The flight crew followed standard procedures and responded promptly to the situation.

The aircraft has been temporarily grounded for a full inspection. Further investigation is underway to determine whether any mechanical or procedural factors contributed to the incident. Recommendations will be issued following the maintenance report. Correction: <input>On June 15, 2025, Cessna 123 experienced minor complications during its landing at Springfield Regional Airport.

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Language students often encounter a variety of issues and challenges that can impede their learning process. What are the most common difficulties they face, and how can these be addressed?

Firstly, language learners frequently struggle with pronunciation and accents. The phonetic differences between their native language and the target language can lead to misunderstandings and communication barriers. This challenge can be mitigated through practice and exposure to native speakers, as well as utilizing language learning tools that focus on pronunciation.

Another significant issue is the complexity of grammar and syntax. Language students often find it difficult to grasp the rules and structures of a new language, which can be vastly different from their own. To overcome this, learners can benefit from structured lessons and exercises that incrementally build their understanding, alongside practical application in conversations and writing.

Vocabulary acquisition is also a hurdle, as memorizing and retaining new words can be overwhelming. Students can address this challenge by using mnemonic devices, engaging in immersive experiences, and employing spaced repetition techniques to reinforce memory.

Additionally, cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions pose challenges, as language is deeply intertwined with culture. Students may struggle to understand context or use language appropriately. Exposure to authentic materials such as films, books, and interactions with native speakers can help bridge this gap.

Finally, motivation and confidence are crucial yet fragile elements. Language learning is a long-term commitment that requires perseverance. Encouragement from peers, setting achievable goals, and celebrating small victories can sustain motivation and boost confidence.

In summary, language students face numerous challenges, but with strategic approaches and consistent effort, these obstacles can be overcome, leading to successful language acquisition.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Now follow up on your meeting with James Stewart by writing him an email with a career choice suggestion for him. Suggest a job and explain why the job is suitable. Use your notes as reference. Response: Dear James,

I hope this message finds you well.

Following our recent meeting on site, I wanted to share a career suggestion that I believe would suit your skills and interests perfectly.

Based on your attention to detail, your positive attitude towards safety procedures, and your hands-on approach when handling tools and equipment, I believe you would make an excellent Site Safety Officer.

This role requires someone who can monitor and enforce safety rules, ensure all workers wear the correct Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), inspect tools and equipment regularly, and report any hazards immediately — all things you showed a strong understanding of during our discussions. Your calm and responsible nature would also be valuable in handling emergencies or guiding evacuations if necessary.

If this is something you’d like to explore further, I’d be happy to help you find the right training or certification to move in that direction.

Let me know your thoughts.

Best regards,

 Correction: <input>Dear James,

I hope this message finds you well.

Following our recent meeting on site, I wanted to share a career suggestion that I believe would suit your skills and interests perfectly.

Based on your attention to detail, your positive attitude towards safety procedures, and your hands-on approach when handling tools and equipment, I believe you would make an excellent Site Safety Officer.

This role requires someone who can monitor and enforce safety rules, ensure all workers wear the correct Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), inspect tools and equipment regularly, and report any hazards immediately<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code>—<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code>all things you showed a strong understanding of during our discussions. Your calm and responsible nature would also be valuable in handling emergencies or guiding evacuations if necessary.

If this is something you’d like to explore further, I’d be happy to help you find the right training or certification to move in that direction.

Let me know your thoughts.

Best regards,<code a=""PHRA"" c=""

Harry is well-known and highly respected in the industry, and under his leadership, our share value has not only recovered but has also reached a historic high.

In this unstable market, we are committed to maintaining stability. We have secured three significant contracts for the coming three years, ensuring guaranteed profits and reinforcing our market position.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Many people find it difficult to start a writing project. They may have difficulty thinking about what to write, so they procrastinate. But everything usually generates more stress and anxiety as the deadline approaches, which in turn can make it even more difficult to start a paper.

There are different techniques, but in my opinion, listening and freewriting are the most effective when you need to tell a story. Listening, talking to other people about your topic and listening to their comments; you will probably learn a new perspective on your topic that you hadn't imagined. 
If you are making an argument, share it with others; what objections do they raise? If you are researching a social issue, interview others and ask their opinion about it. Freewriting, to overcome anxiety or blockage, force yourself to write about the topic for five to ten minutes without stopping. 
If you get stuck and don't know what to say, simply write “I don't know what to say...”. Keep writing and don't stop until the time is up. Remember that freewriting is for your eyes only, so there is no pressure to “get it right.” After five or ten minutes, stop writing. Read what you have written.

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Language learning is a rewarding but often challenging journey. Students frequently face difficulties that range from pronunciation struggles to mastering grammar and vocabulary retention. One common issue is overcoming the fear of making mistakes. Many learners hesitate to speak because they worry about errors, which can hinder their progress. Confidence-building exercises, such as practicing with native speakers or engaging in conversations, help students gain fluency.

Another challenge is understanding cultural nuances. Language is deeply tied to culture, and learners may struggle with idioms, slang, or expressions that don’t directly translate. Exposure to authentic materials, such as movies, books, and conversations, enhances cultural comprehension.

Additionally, memorizing vocabulary and grammar rules can be daunting. Rote learning often fails to stick, so students benefit from active learning techniques, such as writing practice, using words in context, and spaced repetition systems.

Consistency is also crucial—many learners start with enthusiasm but struggle with maintaining a regular study schedule. Setting achievable goals and incorporating language learning into daily routines can help sustain progress. 

By addressing these challenges with patience and persistence, students can improve their proficiency and enjoy the process of mastering a new language.

Today, I’m proud to share that we’ve reached an important milestone on our journey—our partnership with Crum has been renewed. This isn’t just a checkpoint; it’s a recognition of the road we’ve traveled together. Crum’s praise for our commitment to quality is a testament to the dedication of every crew member on this voyage.

But not every stretch of the path has been smooth. About three months ago, we hit some rough terrain—unresolved defects that slowed our progress and tested our resilience. Alongside that, we encountered smaller bumps: technical glitches that, while minor, reminded us of the importance of constant vigilance.

We didn’t just patch the tires and keep going. We rerouted. We changed how we deliver updates and reinforced our Quality Assurance checkpoints. These adjustments have made our vehicle stronger and more reliable.

Looking ahead, we’re not just cruising—we’re preparing. We’re committed to offering even more support to ensure our customers experience a seamless ride. With the right tools and teamwork, we’ll keep moving forward—smarter, faster, and stronger.

Thank you.

Hi, there.

I have a problem I'd like your help with. I know what a creative writer you are. Could you take a look at the text below and rewrite it for me to make it more interesting? Here's the text:

Dear colleague,

This is to inform you of an upcoming change in company policy. Starting on the first Monday of next month, the company will be providing free breakfasts to all employees. We hope this will be a way to lessen the stress of trying to grab something to eat before getting to work, and also give us all a chance to socialize a bit before we start our day.

We're very pleased with our menu. We will be offering fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, bagels and doughnuts every day. In addition, we will have one hot item each day. This could be anything from scrambled eggs and potatoes to pancakes with maple syrup. We will also be offering fresh-brewed coffees and teas, along with fresh-squeezed orange and grapefruit juices.

I'd like everyone to be as excited as I am, and I'm hoping that, with your help and creativity, this new policy will be a big success.

Thanks for your help.

Mumbai, a bustling metropolis on India's western coast, is a city that never sleeps. Its energetic pace, towering skyline, and vibrant street life define its identity. The local trains, crowded markets, and late-night food stalls all contribute to its charm. Mumbai is also a cultural melting pot—home to Bollywood, diverse communities, and a rhythm that pulses through every lane.

Then there's Udaipur, nestled in the hills of Rajasthan, where time slows and elegance takes center stage. Known as the “City of Lakes,” Udaipur offers tranquility with its calm waters, whitewashed palaces, and narrow alleyways. It’s a place for reflection, rich in history and artistic heritage. The air feels lighter, the horizon broader, and the sunsets deeper.

While Mumbai thrives on speed, Udaipur flourishes in serenity. One thrives in modernity, the other glows with tradition. Together, they reveal the incredible diversity within India—one city rushing toward tomorrow, the other preserving yesterday. And in the contrast between them, you find not a conflict but a balance.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: Corporate Social Responsibility: A Necessary Balance

I believe that companies do have a responsibility to society, not just to their shareholders. While it’s true that businesses exist to generate profit, their operations are deeply intertwined with the communities and environments in which they function. Ignoring this connection not only damages a company’s public image but can also hurt long-term profitability.

Companies benefit from public infrastructure, legal protections, and the labor of local populations. In return, they should contribute positively to society. This could be through sustainable practices, fair wages, ethical sourcing, and community investment. As lil@213 pointed out, it’s a two-way street—businesses operate in spaces granted by society, and they should give back in ways that ensure mutual benefit.

Moreover, CSR isn’t just about doing the right thing; it’s smart business. As Jack@MSU mentioned, consumers today are more aware and concerned about how companies behave. A strong CSR strategy can build brand loyalty and attract talent, which ultimately supports the bottom line.

That said, I agree with patty925 to some extent—governments should set the rules. But companies can and should go beyond just meeting the bare minimum. Responsibility shouldn’t end where legality begins.

In conclusion, corporate social responsibility isn’t a distraction from profit—it’s a way to ensure sustainable success for businesses and the societies they depend on.

That said, I agree with patty925 to some extent—governments should set the rules. But companies can and should go beyond just meeting the bare minimum. Responsibility shouldn’t end where legality begins.

In conclusion, corporate social responsibility isn’t a distraction from profit—it’s a way to ensure sustainable success for businesses and the societies they depend on.<code a=""PHRA"" c="""">

Hey [Bumba],

I just had the wildest experience at the grocery store today, and I couldn't wait to tell you about it! So, picture this: I'm in the produce aisle, minding my own business, when suddenly a squirrel comes darting across the floor. Yes, a squirrel! It was zig-zagging between the apples and bananas like it was on a mission.

As I stood there, bewildered, one of the store employees rushed over with a broom, trying to gently guide the little critter outside. But the squirrel was having none of it! It jumped onto the cart of an unsuspecting woman who let out a shriek that could have shattered glass. People were laughing and scrambling to get out of its path. It was like a scene straight out of a comedy movie.

Eventually, the squirrel found its way out the automatic doors, leaving behind a trail of amused and confused shoppers. I couldn't help but chuckle all the way home. Who knew grocery shopping could be so entertaining?

Hope you're having a less chaotic day!

It has beautiful beaches, green hills, and a mix of modern and traditional culture. Some popular places in Vizag are Ramakrishna Beach, Kailasagiri Hill Park, and the INS Kursura Submarine Museum. The city has good facilities like shopping malls, schools, and hospitals, making it a great place to live and visit. Vizag's mix of city life and cultural heritage attracts many people.

It is surrounded by green hills and beautiful nature, perfect for those who love the outdoors. Life in Narsipatnam is slower, and people know each other well. The town doesn't have as many modern facilities as Vizag, but it has a simple and charming atmosphere. The local markets, traditional festivals, and friendly people make it feel like home.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: I believe that companies do have a responsibility to society, and this goes beyond just making a profit for their shareholders. While it’s important for businesses to be profitable, they also operate in communities that support them. These communities, as well as the environment, play a key role in their success. Companies should consider their impact on these areas and contribute to their well-being.

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) can lead to long-term benefits for companies. For example, by adopting sustainable business practices, companies can protect resources for the future while also reducing their carbon footprint. Providing fair wages and good working conditions for employees can lead to higher job satisfaction, lower turnover, and greater productivity. This is not only beneficial for the company but also for the individuals and families it supports.

Additionally, consumers are increasingly aware of companies’ social and environmental impacts. They are more likely to support businesses that demonstrate ethical behavior and contribute positively to society. A strong CSR program can help build trust and loyalty among customers, which ultimately helps the company’s bottom line.

In conclusion, CSR is not just about charity or public image. It’s a smart and ethical business practice that benefits both the company and the society in which it operates.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: Use the information in the notes to write an informative text about NAFTA, or write about a trade agreement your country is a part of. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: NAFTA is an abbreviation for the North American Free Trade Agreement. To be more specific, it was an economic agreement between the US, Canada, and Mexico, and it came into force in January 1994 after several years of negotiation. 

After this agreement commenced, it had a profound effect on trade relations among these participating countries, especially on agriculture. Despite the Mexican agriculture sector having particular concerns about the influx of agricultural products, it turned out that trade within the region had expanded, and income had increased, especially in Mexico.  What this meant was that rather more Mexican fruits and vegetables flowed into the US.

NAFTA was basically for reducing or eliminating barriers to customs duties and investments among these three countries. Although there were some negative impacts, like charging trade competition and job migration, it mostly had positive influences on all participants. To put it another way,  NAFTA was generally beneficial to the North American economy. Correction: <input>NAFTA is an abbreviation for the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Two training companies were investigated and analyzed. TrainQuick and Skills Pro.

TrainQuick is cheap and flexible. However, their courses are not being used in the other branch. Employees do not like being mixed with employees from other branches in their classes. 

Skills Pro is more expensive. Nevertheless, the course content is described as difficult and complex by the employees. However, the course is often finished successfully by the personnel who have taken it. What is more, the course is planned to be expanded soon, including more features and variety to the in-class activities.  

All in all, the recommendation is to go with Skills Pro. Although it is pricey, the quality is top notch and is considered as a high priority by the employees and managers.

I trust you're both well. I've been reflecting on our current situation and think I've identified a promising alternative solution that could address our concerns and needs effectively. Please consider this proposal.

How about moving our showroom to the newly developed Riverside Market area? This location is gaining popularity thanks to its variety of dining options, boutique stores, and entertainment venues, attracting significant foot traffic. The rent is quite reasonable at $3,200 per month, and the area's increasing popularity could help us reach a wider range of customers.

This move would allow us to preserve the personal touch and physical presence Josh values, while also adopting a more modern business approach with a better website as Ken has recommended. It's a way to offer both the physical experience of our fabrics and in-person consultations, and the convenience of online shopping.

Moreover, Riverside Market frequently hosts community events and markets, presenting an excellent opportunity for us to participate and introduce our clothing line to a larger audience. We could also provide on-site measurements during these events to attract new customers who might not find us otherwise.

I believe this strategy offers a good compromise between keeping our bespoke service and reducing expenses. Let's discuss this further to see if it aligns with our objectives.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a paragraph describing how robots are being used in your country. How do you feel about them? In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: “He replaced 10 men on the hose, so he does a very heavy job. When there is a forest fire, it is very exhausting and exposes the firefighters. It contributes a lot to this”, explained Fernanda Morelli, executive director of Ambipar Robotics.

The robot has an operating autonomy of 10 hours, withstands temperatures of up to 600°C for 15 minutes and also has a displacement mechanism that does not use rubber, but a bronze and aluminum mat that does not produce sparks on the floor.

This allows access to locations with fuel leaks without putting anyone at risk.
As it is operated by remote control from up to 300 meters away and with signal return via Wi-Fi, STW Response can be monitored by a control center. It has seven cameras located on the front, back and sides, as well as a thermal and a night camera.

During the biggest event in the oil and gas sector in Latin America, held from September 23 to 26 in Rio de Janeiro, STW Response was one of the attractions at the Ambipar stand. According to Morelli, he is ready to take action in the country.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: The process of buying a home and applying for a home loan varies widely depending on the country, but it generally involves multiple steps and can range from straightforward to complex. Here's a general overview:
In many countries, purchasing a home begins with determining your budget and getting pre-approved for a mortgage. Pre-approval involves submitting documents such as proof of income, credit history, and identification to the lender. The process can be time-consuming, with multiple forms to fill out and requirements to meet. Some countries have streamlined online systems, while others still rely on more traditional paperwork.
Housing prices vary greatly depending on the location, with urban centers often being significantly more expensive than rural areas. In some regions, housing affordability is a major concern, and buyers may face stiff competition, especially in high-demand markets.
Interest rates on home loans depend on the economy, central bank policies, and the borrower's creditworthiness. Fixed-rate loans offer stability, while variable rates can fluctuate over time. As of 2024, many countries have seen fluctuating rates due to global economic conditions, ranging from as low as 3% to over 7% annually.
While using a real estate agent or mortgage broker isn't always mandatory, their expertise can be invaluable. Agents help navigate the housing market, and brokers assist in finding favorable loan terms. Both professionals can simplify a complex process but may add to the cost. Overall, buying a home requires thorough research, planning, and patience.

Submitted to: Alex Capet, Capet's Capital
Proposed by: Giulia Mariotti, Zen Boutique Hotel & Wellness

Zen Boutique Hotel offers luxury accommodations, wellness services, and gourmet dining, catering to the growing trend of wellness tourism. Market research by AccomData Group highlights a rising demand for health-focused resorts and dissatisfaction with fitness center cuisine, presenting an opportunity to find a niche in this market.

The hotel will feature healthy, gourmet cuisine by top chefs, fully equipped gyms, swimming pools, and experienced instructors, providing a complete wellness experience. We project a return on investment by Year 2, with annual profits of $1 million from Year 3. The investment will be recouped within 4 years, and profits will begin in Year 5.

Zen Wellness Group has partnered with Kudos Advertising Agency for an intensive media campaign to drive awareness and bookings. We are confident Zen will become a leading destination for health-conscious travelers.

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share a unique and entertaining experience I had at the park yesterday. While out for my usual jog, I noticed a large crowd gathered around something intriguing, so I decided to take a closer look.

To my surprise, it turned out to be an impromptu dance-off. One participant was dressed in a full dinosaur costume, and he was challenging others to dance battles. His moves were unexpectedly agile and quite funny, which made the crowd cheer and join in the fun.

Things got even more entertaining when someone in a banana costume joined the dance circle. What followed was an impressive and comical showdown between the dinosaur and the banana, featuring breakdancing and moonwalking. It felt like being part of a delightful comedy scene, and I laughed until I nearly cried.

I even joined the dancing for a bit, although my moves were far from spectacular. It was a wonderful, unexpected moment of joy, and I wish you had been there to experience it too.

I hope this story brings a smile to your face. Let's catch up soon! Correction: <input>Hi Suraj,

Zen aims to capitalize on the growing trend of weekend getaways to relaxing resorts and the increasing focus on a healthy lifestyle, as identified by market research from the AccomData Group. Our boutique hotel will stand out by offering a unique blend of luxury accommodation and comprehensive wellness facilities. Unlike typical fitness centers that offer unsatisfying cuisine, Zen will feature a healthy menu crafted by top chefs from renowned restaurants. Guests will enjoy access to fully equipped gyms and swimming pools, with guidance from trained instructors. The construction of Zen is estimated to take two years, with a return on investment expected in the second year after opening. We project an annual profit of $1 million starting in the fifth year, with the investment recouped within four years from opening.

Risk Assessment

Our financial projections account for potential economic downturns. If the economy remains stable, the timeframe for recouping investment and realizing profits could be reduced by half. To ensure a successful launch, we have partnered with Kudos Advertising Agency to run an intensive media campaign, aimed at establishing Zen as a premier destination for those seeking a luxurious and health-focused retreat.

One of the most popular is Leuk Daur, it is say that is creature living in the ocean and is the first habitant of Dakar the capital.
It can take the appearance of an animal: lion, snake…. sometimes and is very terrific.
During childhood we listened to many stories about this terrific creature and were really afraid to go out during the night to avoid meeting that creature. 
We did many bad dreams about that creature as well. But at the adult age we are sceptic about all these stories around Leuk Daur and do not believe that anymore.

Date: September 19
To: André Risson
From: Eurípedes Garcia Batista
Subject: Cessna 123 Landing Incident

During the recent landing of Cessna 123 at Aeroporto Santa Genoveva in the city of  Goiânia  there were several issues that require attention and analysis. This report outlines the observed problems and provides recommendations for improvement.
As it follows, the main observations are concerning  the approaching angle of the  Cessna 123 as it  approached the runway at a steeper angle than recommended, resulting in a hard touchdown. 
As to the  flare timing, the pilot initiated the flare too late, causing the aircraft to touch down abruptly and finally, as far as the crosswind handling is concerned, Cessna 123 struggled to maintain alignment with the runway during crosswind conditions.
Some Recommendations:
As to timing, we suggest that the pilot should undergo additional training on proper approach and flare techniques.
Concerning crosswind training we suggest that the specific crosswind landing training is essential to improve handling during adverse conditions. 
In respect to the review SOPs, we suggest that it is ensured adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs) for safe landings.

In conclusion, addressing these issues will enhance safety and prevent similar incidents in the future.  Regular training and adherence to procedures are critical for all pilots.
  
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Eurípedes Garcia Batista

Hi,

Hope you are doing well!

I just had to share something a bit weird, a little exciting, and honestly kind of hilarious that happened recently.

So picture this. I was on a video call, fully focused, camera on, all professional - until halfway through the meeting, my smart speaker in the background suddenly decided it had something to say. Out of nowhere, it blurted out, ""I didn't quite catch that, could you repeat? - ""In the middle of someone presenting a financial update! I froze. Everyone paused. Then someone said, ""well even the AI is confused about these numbers"".

We all had a good laugh, and it actually turned into a mini icebreaker. Now I double-check that my device are on mute before any call.

Just a little reminder that even tech as a sense of humor.

But let’s not forget the challenges we faced. Three months ago, we encountered roadblocks—unresolved defects that threatened our progress. On top of that, minor technical hurdles made the path even more difficult.

Instead of letting these obstacles slow us down, we reinforced our foundation. We restructured how we deliver updates, ensuring smoother transitions. We strengthened our Quality Assurance processes, creating a more reliable system. These improvements transformed a shaky bridge into a strong and stable one.

Looking ahead, our mission is clear: we will continue reinforcing this bridge, ensuring that no cracks appear. By staying proactive, we will prevent future issues and maintain the trust of our customers and partners.

Thank you all for your dedication—together, we are building something stronger than ever.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Criticizing celebrities or the concept of celebrity culture can be a delicate task. Here’s a general critique of the idea of celebrity:

The phenomenon of celebrity culture often glorifies individuals for superficial reasons, such as their appearance or social media presence, rather than their genuine contributions to society. This can lead to a distorted sense of values, where fame and wealth are prioritized over integrity and hard work. Celebrities are frequently placed on pedestals, creating unrealistic standards that can negatively impact the self-esteem of their followers. Moreover, the constant scrutiny and invasion of privacy that celebrities endure can be detrimental to their mental health, highlighting the toxic nature of fame. The media’s obsession with celebrities also diverts attention from more pressing global issues, such as climate change and social justice, which deserve greater focus and action. In essence, while the allure of celebrity can be captivating, it often promotes a culture that is shallow and disconnected from the realities and challenges faced by everyday people.

The phenomenon of celebrity culture often glorifies individuals for superficial reasons, such as their appearance or social media presence, rather than their genuine contributions to society. This can lead to a distorted sense of values, where fame and wealth are prioritized over integrity and hard work. Celebrities are frequently placed on pedestals, creating unrealistic standards that can negatively impact the self-esteem of their followers. Moreover, the constant scrutiny and invasion of privacy that celebrities endure can be detrimental to their mental health, highlighting the toxic nature of fame. The media’s obsession with celebrities also diverts attention from more pressing global issues, such as climate change and social justice, which deserve greater focus and action. In essence, while the allure of celebrity can be captivating, it often promotes a culture that is shallow and disconnected from the realities and challenges faced by everyday people.</input>",121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4,16.0,5,5,0,True,0.587,"{'Score 0': 0.0005, 'Score 1': 0.001, 'Score 2': 0.0086, 'Score 3': 0.0747, 'Score 4': 0.3281, 'Score 5': 0.5869}"

Hope this email finds you well.
With regards to the discussion we had regarding the priority projects, please find the attached list of projects that are necessary and unnecessary.
* Priority Projects:
US Client Design
The US client will work with us if we design the workforce well and give our best effort to perform well. This project is very good in terms of profitability. Although the progress of the project is very slow but this will pick up shortly.
New Hires:
We are spending huge on advertising for new recruitment however this is very important as two former employees leaving us in Q2. We will be needing very good resources in replacement so as to run the projects smoothly.
Less Priority:
Marketing Media Reorganisation:
We are spending a lot on marketing media. I agree that use of marketing media is important but since the one we are using is outdated and requires a lot of effort to organise, my belief is to stop that and to think of a better alternative.
Thanking You,
Sovanlal

I see your yard is untidy and the sidewalk is cluttered, it is important to mantein well the exterior appearance of your shop. Also, I see that on the roof there are some loose bricks, it could be really dangerous. Just imagine one of them fall off and injure someone. Moreover, the drainpipe is blocked by leaves and need to be cleaned more often. If not, it could create a water leak through the roof.  



Second, let's go to analyze the interior

I think your shop has many things to be arranged. For example, the shop has a poor lighting, there are no air conditioning, the fire extinguishers are old and may not work when needed because of low pressure. Not least, those chemicals you have can be a fire hazard. Therefore, I suggest you to replace the lighting and extintors, install ventilation and throw away the unnecessary chemicals.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: In Support of Corporate Social Responsibility

In the contemporary global economy, corporations are not isolated entities operating solely for profit; they are integral components of the societies in which they function. As such, they bear a responsibility that extends beyond the interests of shareholders. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) represents a strategic and ethical commitment to sustainable development, social equity, and environmental stewardship.

Engaging in CSR initiatives allows companies to foster trust and credibility among stakeholders, including customers, employees, and the broader community. By supporting educational programs, environmental conservation, and fair labor practices, corporations contribute to the long-term well-being of the societies that enable their success. These actions are not merely philanthropic—they are investments in a stable and prosperous operating environment.

Furthermore, CSR enhances employee morale and retention, as individuals increasingly seek to work for organizations that reflect their personal values. Consumers, too, are more inclined to support brands that demonstrate genuine social and environmental concern. In this sense, CSR is not only ethically sound but also economically advantageous.

While some critics argue that CSR is a superficial marketing strategy, its tangible benefits to both society and business performance are well-documented. Ultimately, responsible corporate behavior is essential for building resilient communities and ensuring sustainable economic growth. Correction: <input>In Support of Corporate Social Responsibility

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Read an email from your friend and give advice on some stressful problems he is having. Type in the input box. Write 100-200 words. Response: Hey [Friend's Name],

I’m really sorry to hear about the stress you're dealing with right now. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate, and I can understand how overwhelming it must feel. First off, remember it’s okay to take a break when things get too much. Try to take a step back and focus on one task at a time. Sometimes breaking down everything into smaller, manageable pieces can make things seem less intimidating.

It might help to talk things through with someone you trust, or even write down your thoughts to clear your mind. I know that sounds simple, but it really can help organize your thoughts and give you a fresh perspective.

Also, if you’re feeling stretched thin, don’t hesitate to ask for help—whether it's from a colleague or even just venting to a friend (like me!). You don’t have to carry everything alone. Finally, make sure you're finding time for yourself, even if it’s just a few minutes a day to relax and recharge. You’ve got this!

Take care, and let me know if you need anything.

-       Mention how White Space beat 20 other top agencies to get the contract from Mishima. (Mr. Mishima himself approved our design.)

-       Bring up that we've got three big contracts lined up in the coming years, and the rise in profits in the past three years.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: Buying a home in my country, which is Spain, can be both exciting and challenging, especially when applying for a home loan. The process itself can be relatively straightforward, but it involves a lot of paperwork and attention to detail. First, one must choose the property, and then apply for a mortgage, which often requires submitting proof of income, tax returns, and details of your financial situation. Also, in Spain it is mandatory to sign the purchase before Notary Public, who can be helpful when it comes to understand all this paperwork.

The forms involved in the process can be numerous, depending on the bank or financial institution. Most banks require a full set of documents, including identification, proof of employment, and details of any other loans. The amount of paperwork might seem overwhelming, but with a good understanding of the requirements, it is manageable. 

In terms of cost, housing in Spain can be quite expensive, especially in larger cities like Madrid or Barcelona, where prices have been rising in recent years. Mortgage rates in Spain are generally low, but they can vary depending on the bank and the applicant's financial situation.

Regarding the use of professionals, it is common to employ a real estate agent to help with the property search.

Hey [Friend’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well! I just had to share this hilarious and exciting story with you. Last weekend, I decided to go for a hike in the nearby forest. Everything was going smoothly until I stumbled upon a group of people dressed in medieval costumes. They were having a live-action role-playing (LARP) event, and somehow, I got roped into joining them!

At first, I was just an observer, but then one of the knights challenged me to a duel. I couldn’t resist the opportunity, so I picked up a foam sword and accepted the challenge. We had an epic battle, with everyone cheering us on. I felt like I was in a real medieval tournament!

The funniest part was when I accidentally tripped over a tree root and fell into a mud puddle. Everyone burst out laughing, including me. Despite the muddy mishap, it was an unforgettable experience. I even made some new friends who invited me to their next LARP event.

Can’t wait to catch up and tell you more about it in person!

At my house, we received printed newspapers every morning. They were delivered by motorcycle couriers. We eagerly awaited the news every morning.
With all this progress, I have changed the way I obtain information.
I have left behind habits and methods in favor of: practicality, agility and diversity of information.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a paragraph describing how robots are being used in your country. How do you feel about them? In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Robots are being used in many ways in the country today. They work in factories to build cars, pack goods, and help with farming. In hospitals, robots help doctors with surgeries and deliver medicines. Some restaurants use robots to serve food. I feel that robots are very useful and exciting. They can do hard work faster and more safely than people. Robots will help society by making work easier, saving time, and even helping in dangerous places like disaster areas. 

However, they might also cause problems. Some people may lose their jobs because robots can do the work instead. Also, if we depend too much on robots, people might lose some skills. Overall, robots will bring many good changes, but we must also be careful about how we use them. We should find a good balance where robots help us without taking away important parts and jobs of human life. The future with robots can be very bright if we use them wisely and with care.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find **metaphor** and **focused free writing** to be the most useful. Metaphors allow me to convey complex ideas and emotions in a relatable and vivid manner. By comparing one thing to another, metaphors create strong imagery and help readers understand abstract concepts more easily. For instance, describing a challenging situation as ""climbing a mountain"" instantly evokes the effort and perseverance required. This technique enriches my writing by adding depth and resonance, making it more engaging for the reader.

On the other hand, focused free writing is invaluable for generating ideas and overcoming writer's block. By setting a specific topic and writing continuously without worrying about grammar or structure, I can explore my thoughts freely and uncover new perspectives. This technique helps in organizing my ideas and often leads to unexpected insights that can be refined later. Focused free writing allows me to delve deeply into a subject, uncovering layers of meaning and connections that might not be immediately apparent. Combining these techniques, I can create engaging and thought-provoking content while maintaining a clear and coherent structure. This blend of creativity and organization is essential for producing high-quality writing that resonates with readers.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The obsession with celebrity culture has become a troubling aspect of modern society. Celebrities are often elevated to the status of untouchable idols, despite their flaws and shortcomings. Take someone like [insert celebrity name], for example—while they may be talented in their field, their personal actions and public behavior often reflect a complete disconnect from reality. They use their platforms to promote unattainable lifestyles, often endorsing products or ideals that are superficial at best, and harmful at worst. The celebrity-driven narrative of perfection distorts the self-image of their audience, particularly younger generations who may feel pressure to emulate these unrealistic standards.

Additionally, the culture of celebrity worship distracts from more meaningful accomplishments and real-world issues. Instead of focusing on individuals who are genuinely making a difference in areas like science, social justice, or education, we choose to put the spotlight on people who have mastered the art of self-promotion. This not only perpetuates shallow values but also diverts attention from the hard work and dedication that truly deserves admiration. It's time we reassess who we choose to glorify and why.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The concept of celebrity often perpetuates an unhealthy obsession with wealth, beauty, and status, overshadowing more meaningful contributions to society. For example, many celebrities are criticized for their excessive lifestyles, flaunting their privilege while being disconnected from the struggles of everyday people. A glaring issue is the way some celebrities use their platforms irresponsibly, spreading misinformation or promoting harmful trends simply to remain relevant. This behavior not only undermines their influence but can also negatively impact their audience, particularly impressionable young fans.  

While it’s undeniable that some celebrities use their fame for good—advocating for important causes or donating to charities—the culture of idolizing individuals based on superficial attributes often prioritizes entertainment over substance. This phenomenon shifts public attention away from critical issues, such as social injustice or environmental challenges. Furthermore, the idea that celebrities are role models is problematic, as many of them make mistakes like anyone else, yet their actions are magnified, sometimes sending the wrong message.  

Ultimately, while celebrity culture isn’t inherently bad, its emphasis on fame over integrity and values needs to be reassessed to promote a more balanced and meaningful societal focus.

I’m Ticiana, and it’s a pleasure to welcome you to Frisko Shipping. Today, I’d like to share a bit about our company’s journey and what makes us a unique and exciting place to work.

Frisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko. What started as a small venture has now grown into a global powerhouse with locations in 20 cities around the world and more than 5,000 dedicated employees. Last year, we achieved a remarkable profit of 5 million dollars and captured 10 percent of the global market.

But beyond the numbers, what truly sets us apart is our team. We expect our new employees to be motivated and enthusiastic, ready to contribute to our ongoing success.

Let me share a personal story about Bill Frisko, our founder. Many of you might not know this, but Bill’s inspiration to start Frisko Shipping came from a life-changing experience. He once fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. Miraculously, a passing ship saved his life. This event sparked his passion for shipping and led to the creation of our company. It’s a powerful reminder that inspiration can come from the most unexpected places.
As you embark on this journey with us, I encourage you to think about what inspires you and how you can bring that passion to your work here at Frisko Shipping. Let’s make waves together and continue to drive our company forward.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: Use the information in the notes to write an informative text about NAFTA, or write about a trade agreement your country is a part of. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a landmark trade pact signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, which came into effect on January 1, 1994. NAFTA aimed to eliminate most tariffs and trade barriers between the three countries, creating one of the largest free-trade zones in the world. The agreement was inspired by the success of the European Economic Community and sought to boost economic growth and job creation through increased trade and investment.

NAFTA's main provisions included the gradual reduction of tariffs, customs duties, and other trade barriers over a period of up to 15 years. This allowed for duty-free access to a wide range of goods and services, fostering economic integration among the member countries. The agreement also included side agreements on labor and environmental standards to address concerns about the potential negative impacts of increased trade.

Despite facing significant opposition and political debates, NAFTA was generally seen as beneficial for the North American economies. It facilitated the flow of goods, services, and capital, contributing to economic growth and higher living standards. However, it also had its critics, who argued that it led to job losses in certain industries exposed to trade competition.

In 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which aimed to modernize and update the trade relationship between the three countries.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: Buying a home in India is a major life decision and involves a lengthy and sometimes complex process. First, one must decide on the location and budget. Housing prices vary significantly across the country. In metro cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore, real estate is extremely expensive, while smaller cities and towns offer more affordable options.

Applying for a home loan requires various documents, including proof of identity, Income, address, and property details. Banks and housing finance companies often request salary slips, bank statements, PAN cards, and employment proof. Though the process has become more streamlined with digital platforms, it can still be time-consuming due to verifications and paperwork.

Interest rates in India vary depending on the bank and the applicant's credit profile. As of now, the average home loan interest rate ranges between 8% and 10%. Many people use areal estate agent or broker to find suitable properties and handle negotiations, although it's not mandatory. For loans, some also use mortgage advisors who help compare offers from various lenders.

Overall, while the process is manageable with the right guidance, it can feel overwhelming for first-time buyers. However, government schemes like PMAY(Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana) provides subsidies that help make housing more affordable for middle-and lower-income families.

""Sabor da Roça"" specializes in traditional Brazilian cuisine, and I decided to try their signature dish, the ""Moqueca de Frutos do Mar."" This seafood stew, simmered in coconut milk with bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes, was simply divine. The prices at Sabor da Roça were also quite reasonable.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: The fuselage is the body of the aircraft. The landing gear can be retracted into the undercarriage of the fuselage after take-off and must be in a GEAR DOWN position before landing. All passenger seats are located in the fuselage, as well as the cockpit and cargo storage locations. Attached to the fuselage are the wings. Due to the curved shape of the upper part of the wing it creates lift, but - by increasing the angle of attack and thus increasing lift - also more drag. For take-off and landing the pilot should use the flaps to decrease the stall speed. At the end of each wing you can find the ailerons. These parts are controlled by moving the stick in the cockpit left and right, causing the airplane to roll into the desired direction. Simultaneously using the rudder to support the directional change is key to a nice and clean turn. The rudder is part of the vertical stabilizer at the tail of the aircraft and controls the rate of turn. Another part of the tail is the horizontal stabilizer. This system is used to change the angle of attack and therefore the rate of climb and the altitude of the aircraft. Last but not least it depends on the type of aircraft which engine type is used. Generally, today there are two common types of engines used in aviation: Single engine piston engines, which commonly run on aviation gas (AVGAS), or turbines, which use jet-fuel or kerosene.

Response: Good morning everyone. Thanks for coming along for the ride today. I'm here to share the story of our journey- one that's taken us through bumps, detours and breakthroughs and that now has us on a clear strong road forward. 
One of the biggest milestone on this road was reaching a renewed partnership with Crum. This wasn't just a pit stop, it was a major checkpoint, showing we are moved in the right direction and gaining momentum. 
Crum has decided to stay on the journey with us not just because of where we have been but because of where we are going. They have seen our persistence, our drive to improve and they are confident in the direction we are heading together.
They matched our commitment to quality with their trust, and it's that shared vision that keeps this partnership going forward. Our dedication to doing things right even when the roads get tough was what kept them on board.
But let's rewind a bit, about three months ago we hit some potholes. Minor defects and lingering in technical issues started to slow us down. They weren't major breakdowns but they had the potential to throw us off course.
So, we calibrated. We pulled over, took a hard look under the hood and made the necessary upgrades. We tightened our quality assurance engine, fine tuned our workflows, and checked every part of the process to ensure a smoother ride ahead.
As we look ahead, we are not just cruising we are accelerating with purpose. We are investing in stronger support system to make sure our teams and our partners avoid roadblocks altogether.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: Use the information in the notes to write an informative text about NAFTA, or write about a trade agreement your country is a part of. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: NAFTA: A Detailed Look at North American Trade
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a groundbreaking accord between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, officially coming into force in January 1994. The culmination of years of intricate negotiations, NAFTA's primary goal was to dramatically reduce or completely eliminate customs duties among its three member states. This initiative aimed to foster a more integrated and fluid economic environment across North America.
NAFTA's impact was far-reaching, profoundly reshaping trade relations, particularly within the agricultural sector. A notable example of this transformation was the significant increase in the flow of Mexican fruits and vegetables into the US market. Beyond agriculture, the agreement influenced various industries by removing trade barriers, which theoretically made goods and services cheaper and more accessible across borders.
While NAFTA generated both positive and negative impacts for each of the participating countries, the general consensus among economists and policymakers is that, overall, it benefited all three members. It spurred economic growth, increased trade volumes, and led to greater specialization in production among the nations. However, it also faced criticism, particularly concerning job displacement in certain sectors and environmental concerns. Despite these debates, NAFTA served as the cornerstone of North American trade policy for over two decades until it was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2020, marking a new chapter in regional economic cooperation.
Would you like to know more about the specific impacts of NAFTA on any of the member countries, or perhaps about the USMCA that replaced it?

Oliver has been with us for just one year and has already made a significant impact. He had a strong start, quickly demonstrating initiative, creativity, and a strong work ethic. His sharp thinking helped identify and resolve a product error, saving the company a substantial amount. He was named Employee of the Month twice and received a well-deserved promotion after only six months.

Oliver brings fresh ideas to the team and consistently delivers quality work with minimal errors. However, he missed two deadlines without informing the team, which caused some workflow issues. Going forward, we encourage Oliver to improve communication and collaborate more closely with colleagues.

His main goals for the coming months are to better manage deadlines and continue growing as a team player. Overall, his performance has been impressive and shows great promise. Correction: <input>Performance Review – Oliver Murray

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your boss has sent you an email, asking you to prepare a presentation about the company. Read the email and draft a speech. Include an introduction, a body (with signposting phrases, where possible), an anecdote and a call to action. Write 150–250 words. Response: Good morning everyone, and welcome to Frisko Shipping!

I’m excited to have the opportunity to introduce you to our company today. I know you’ve all come here with great enthusiasm and a desire to be part of something special, and I can promise you, Frisko Shipping is exactly that. But don’t just take my word for it—let’s dive into the story behind our global success and see why you’re joining a team that’s truly exceptional.

Let me begin with a brief history.
Frisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko, a visionary with a passion for global trade. What started as a small shipping company has now grown into a powerhouse with locations in 20 cities across the world. With over 5,000 employees, we’ve built an international network that moves millions of goods every day, connecting markets and communities in ways that many companies only dream of.

Last year, we achieved a profit of 5 million dollars and captured 10% of the global market. It’s an impressive track record, and it reflects the dedication of every person who has worked here—and now, that includes you!

But it’s not just about the numbers. We believe that people are at the heart of everything we do. We want you to bring your enthusiasm, your motivation, and your drive to the table. New employees like you are expected to bring fresh ideas and energy into the company, and in return, we promise you’ll be part of a company that values growth, creativity, and a strong sense of teamwork.

Now, let me share an anecdote about Bill Frisko himself.
Many of you may already know that Bill’s journey to founding Frisko Shipping wasn’t a typical one. In fact, it was an experience that could’ve been the end of his career. On one of his early adventures, Bill fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. But rather than letting this life-changing moment defeat him, Bill saw it as a sign to make a change. In fact, the very ship that rescued him became the inspiration for the birth of Frisko Shipping. Bill often says that you can find inspiration in the most unexpected places—even in the middle of a life-threatening situation. And that’s the kind of mindset we value here. Anything can happen, and with the right perspective, it can lead to incredible opportunities.

Before I finish, I want to make sure you’re thinking ahead—not just about what Frisko Shipping is today, but about what we can become together. So, here’s a little challenge for you: How much do you really know about the company you’ve just joined? I’d like to kick things off with a fun quiz to see how many facts you’ve already picked up. It’s a great way to test your knowledge and get you even more excited about being a part of our journey.

In conclusion, as you step into your new roles, remember that you’re not just joining a company—you’re joining a movement. A movement that began with a spark of inspiration and has grown into something truly global. So, let’s work together, think outside the box, and continue to build on the foundation of success that we’ve all worked so hard to create.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: I will write about a famous or infamous celebrity, Salman Khan depending on your perspective of how you see him. He has been a towering figure in Bollywood, epitomizes the paradox of celebrity culture. While his charisma and box-office dominance in films like, 'Dabangg' and 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' have earned him a massive following, his career is marred by controversies, alleged involvement in hit-and-run cases, poaching scandals, and accusations of promoting toxic masculinity through hyper-macho roles. These incidents highlight a troubling aspect of his persona: a perceived sense of impunity, often shielded by wealth and fame. His fans’ unwavering loyalty, despite such issues, underscores a broader problem with celebrity worship—where charisma overshadows accountability.

The concept of celebrity itself is flawed. It elevates individuals to near-mythical status, creating a disconnect from reality. Fans idolize stars like Salman Khan, projecting ideals onto them while ignoring their human failings. This culture fosters superficial values, prioritizing fame and wealth over substance. Celebrities often exploit this adulation, perpetuating a cycle of unchecked power and influence.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Being rich and famous is everyone's dream, or at least for many. But is being famous really that appealing? These days, thanks to mass media and the internet, many people quickly go from anonymity to fame. TV shows about royalty, videos posted on YouTube, and social media have made it possible to create celebrities, like cooking popcorn. While some know how to handle this media attention and make the most of it, many also begin to exhibit bizarre behavior, and others experience periods of depression when they realize how empty their lives are behind a gilded facade.
Many celebrities, especially athletes, singers, and actors, spend much of their virtual lives—that is, on social media—posting photos of themselves at parties and on lavish vacations, or photos of their luxurious homes or luxury cars. Some seek to link their image to philanthropists who donate money to public causes or people in need. There's no better marketing! Then, they return to their luxurious lives with a purified soul. Unknown heroes like Superman or Spider-Man are only found in comic books. I personally believe that being rich and famous, that is, having immense power, means, above all, having a great responsibility and respect for others, as we owe them. And if we have been blessed with this kind of fortune, we should focus on creating well-being for society and put aside vanity and ostentation.

While some know how to handle this media attention and make the most of it, many also begin to exhibit bizarre behavior, and others experience periods of depression when they realize how empty their lives are behind a gilded facade.<code a=""PHRA"" c=""

</code>Many celebrities, especially athletes, singers, and actors, spend much of their virtual lives—that is, on social media—posting photos of themselves at parties and on lavish vacations, or photos of their luxurious homes or luxury cars. Some seek to link their image to philanthropists who donate money to public causes or people in need. There's no better marketing! Then, they return to their luxurious lives with a purified soul. Unknown heroes like Superman or Spider-Man are only found in comic books. I personally believe that being rich and famous, that is, having immense power, means, above all, having a great responsibility and respect for others, as we owe them. And if we have been blessed with this kind of fortune, we should focus on creating well-being for society and put aside vanity and ostentation.</input>",121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4,16.0,5,5,0,True,0.549,"{'Score 0': 0.0007, 'Score 1': 0.0014, 'Score 2': 0.0114, 'Score 3': 0.0857, 'Score 4': 0.3518, 'Score 5': 0.5488}"

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: The main body of an aircraft is known as the fuselage. It typically has a long, narrow, tubular shape designed to minimize air resistance and enhance aerodynamic efficiency. Inside the fuselage is the cabin, where the flight crew and passengers are accommodated throughout the journey. The landing gear is housed in the lower section of the fuselage and can be retracted after takeoff and deployed again during landing.

Extending from either side of the fuselage are the wings, which are fundamental to generating lift. They are slightly curved—a design feature known as an airfoil—that allows air to move more quickly over the top surface than the bottom, creating the lift necessary for flight. Attached to the rear edge of the wings are flaps, which are hinged control surfaces. When lowered, flaps increase the curvature and surface area of the wing, enhancing lift during critical phases such as takeoff and landing.

The stability of the aircraft is largely maintained by the tail assembly, located at the rear of the plane. The vertical component of the tail is referred to as the vertical stabilizer or fin, which helps maintain directional stability. Attached to it is the rudder, a movable surface that enables the aircraft to yaw, or turn left and right, during flight. Correction: <input>The main body of an aircraft is known as the fuselage.

The plane originally took off from Oakland to Phoenix with 141 passengers and no problems at first.
The crew saw error messages about the nose landing gear and steering.
They flew by the control tower in San Jose, which confirmed the nose wheels were facing the wrong way.
The captain chose San Francisco for landing due to its better emergency support and longer runway.
To make the landing safer, the crew flew around to burn fuel and reduce weight.
Passengers were told about the gear issue and evacuation plans in case of an emergency.
The captain landed the plane carefully, avoiding reverse thrust and using normal brakes.
Tires tore apart during landing, but the plane stayed straight on the runway.

To start off, II'l talk about the origins of our company
After that, I'll talk about our profit and our market share.
To wrap up, I'll hold a Q and A session.

To kick off, Frisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko, I'm not sure if any of you know this, Bill was on a sea voyage, on that voyage a storm happened and he fell into the sea and was lost for a few hours, during that time a shark attacked him and injured him, very scared and terrified, he asked God for help, soon a ship appeared and saved him, this inspired him to start his own ship company.
after that the company grew, locations in 20 cities all over the world, more than 5,000 employees.
 
Let's change gears, if I can draw your attention to  the pie chart, our profit of 5 million dollars last year and 10 percent of the global market.

To comclude, I'm going to do a little quiz

when was founded the  Frisko Shipping?

how bill got the idea to found  the  Frisko Shipping?

What was our market share last year?

How many employees does Frisco Shipping have?

That concludes my presentation, thank you for Listening.

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: An airplane is a complex machine composed of several essential components, each playing a crucial role in ensuring its functionality and ability to fly. At the core is the fuselage, the main body of the aircraft, which houses the cockpit, passenger cabin, and cargo space. The cockpit contains the controls and navigation systems, enabling pilots to operate the airplane. The fuselage's structure is designed to withstand pressure differences during flight, ensuring passenger safety and comfort.
The wings are perhaps the most critical elements for flight. Their aerodynamic shape creates lift by generating lower pressure on the upper surface and higher pressure underneath. Flaps and ailerons on the wings further enhance control during takeoff, landing, and turns.
The tail assembly, also known as the empennage, provides stability. It includes the vertical stabilizer, which prevents side-to-side motion, and the horizontal stabilizer, which manages pitch control.
Finally, engines, whether jet or propeller-based, generate the thrust necessary for forward motion. Together, these parts harmonize to enable safe and efficient air travel.

Recommending a training company for our staff is the aim of this report. In total we compared two different training companies: TrainQuick and Skills Pro. 

Skills Pro represents the best option for us. First of all the training quality and the continuous development of the courses is a key factor for us in selecting a training company. This is one of its principal advantages of Skills Pro - they plan to expand their course set and improve them continuously. Secondly, the course is difficult, but people who take the course regularly, will finish it successfully. The only major drawback of Skills Pro is its high cost. 

By contrast, looking at TrainQuick, its costs are much less, but they fall short in the usage rates. Employees are being mixed with people from other branches, what results in a lack of motivation from the employees. They don't like being in a group of people from other branches.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: In India, robots are revolutionizing various industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, and customer service. In manufacturing, robots perform tasks like welding, painting, and assembly, which significantly enhance productivity and efficiency. In healthcare, robots assist in surgeries, rehabilitation, and elderly care, providing precise and reliable support. Agricultural robots are used for planting, harvesting, and pesticide spraying, helping farmers increase yield and reduce labor costs.

While robots have the potential to positively impact society by increasing efficiency, reducing human error, and performing dangerous tasks, they also pose challenges such as job displacement and the need for substantial investment in training and infrastructure. It is essential to balance technological advancement with social considerations to ensure the harmonious integration of robots into society. Additionally, ethical considerations regarding privacy and security must be addressed to prevent misuse and ensure that the benefits of robotic technology are equitably distributed across all segments of society.

I just have to tell you about the craziest thing that happened to me the other day!

I was so confused! I stopped to look around, thinking it must have been someone's pet, but there were no houses nearby. The duck quacked a few times and then just stood there, staring at me. I tried to shoo it away, but it just kept following.

Eventually, I had to walk all the way home with this duck tagging along, which was honestly hilarious and a little bit awkward. By the time I got to my doorstep, the duck just turned around and wandered off, like it had completed its mission. It was the weirdest thing, but kind of made my day!

"Prompt Level: 9.0 Prompt: Write a summary of a negotiation. It could be something you did at work, something you purchased on your own, or a summary of what happened in the movies in this unit. What was the preliminary offer? What happened during the negotiations? What was the final deal? Type in the input box. Write 100-150 words. This activity is non-graded. Response: A recent negotiation I handled at work involved renegotiating a service contract with a vendor. The preliminary offer from the vendor included a standard renewal with a slight price increase. However, after reviewing the service quality and comparing competitors’ rates, I proposed maintaining the existing price while adding performance guarantees.
During the negotiation, both sides exchanged counteroffers. The vendor argued that operational costs had increased, justifying the price hike. I countered by highlighting our long-standing partnership and suggesting a compromise: a small price adjustment, but with additional service benefits included.
After a few discussions, we agreed on a final deal—a moderate price increase, but with enhanced service terms, including faster response times and additional support features. It was a win-win, as the vendor secured a renewal, and we gained better value for our investment.

Thank you for your feedback! I’ve revised the speech to improve cohesion and ensure smooth transitions between points. I’ve also varied the references to Crum to avoid repetition. Here’s the updated version:

Opening:

We are delighted to announce the renewal of our partnership with Crum. This achievement underscores our team’s dedication and hard work. As an added bonus, our commitment to quality has been recognized and praised by our partners.

Body:

Three months ago, we faced a significant challenge with unresolved defects in our products. These issues were causing disruptions and dissatisfaction among our customers. Additionally, we encountered several minor technical problems that further complicated the situation.

To address these challenges, we implemented two key solutions:

Changed Update Delivery: We revised our update delivery process to ensure more timely and efficient rollouts. This change has helped us minimize disruptions and provide a smoother experience for our customers.
Improved Quality Assurance Processes: We enhanced our Quality Assurance (QA) processes to identify and resolve defects more effectively. This improvement has significantly reduced the number of issues and increased the overall reliability of our products.
These solutions were only possible because of the excellent cross-team collaboration within our organization. By working together, we were able to overcome these challenges and improve our service quality.

Closing:

Looking ahead, we are committed to providing further support to avoid any future problems with our customers. Our focus will remain on continuous improvement and maintaining the high standards that have earned us the trust and praise of our partners. By prioritizing quality and customer satisfaction, we aim to strengthen our partnerships and achieve even greater success in the future.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Among various writing methods, I find free writing and metaphor to be particularly useful. Free writing allows writers to tap into their subconscious mind, generating new ideas and perspectives. By writing freely without stopping or worrying about grammar, spelling, or coherence, writers can overcome writer's block and produce authentic content. This method helps to loosen up the writing muscles, making it easier to express thoughts and feelings.

Metaphor, on the other hand, enables writers to convey complex ideas and emotions in a concise and powerful way. By comparing two unlike things, metaphors create vivid imagery, making writing more engaging and memorable. Metaphors also allow writers to convey subtle shades of meaning, adding depth and nuance to their writing. When combined with free writing, metaphors can help writers to create rich, evocative, and authentic content that resonates with readers. Metaphorical writing uses comparisons to create vivid and evocative language, often to convey complex emotions and ideas. Correction: <input>Among various writing methods, I find free writing and metaphor to be particularly useful. Free writing allows writers to tap into their subconscious mind, generating new ideas and perspectives. By writing freely without stopping or worrying about grammar, spelling, or coherence, writers can overcome writer<code a=""NOUN:POSS"" c=""’s"">'s</code> block and produce authentic content. This method helps to loosen up the writing muscles, making it easier to express thoughts and feelings.

Metaphor, on the other hand, enables writers to convey complex ideas and emotions in a concise and powerful way. By comparing two unlike things, metaphors create vivid imagery, making writing more engaging and memorable. Metaphors also allow writers to convey subtle shades of meaning, adding depth and nuance to their writing. When combined with free writing, metaphors can help writers to create rich, evocative, and authentic content that resonates with readers.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: “El Chupacabras,” a legendary creature in Mexican and Latin American folklore, is often described as a vampiric, fearsome predator with a penchant for attacking livestock, especially goats, from which its name “chupa” (suck) and “cabra” (goat) originates. The creature first gained attention in the 1990s following reports of livestock deaths, where animals were found drained of blood with mysterious puncture wounds.

Descriptions of El Chupacabras vary widely, but common characteristics include a reptilian or alien-like appearance, spines or quills along its back, and glowing red or green eyes. It’s typically depicted as either bipedal or with a crouched, menacing stance. Some describe it as the size of a small bear, with rough, grayish-green skin and sharp claws or fangs, adding to its supernatural allure.

Despite numerous sightings and alleged encounters, no scientific evidence has been found to support its existence. However, stories of El Chupacabras continue to spread, fueled by media coverage and local folklore, making it one of Mexico’s most enduring modern legends. Its legacy persists in popular culture, embodying fears of the unknown and unexplained in rural areas.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your friend is about to open a secondhand clothes shop. He doesn’t have much capital, and is renting a very old building. He has got a few quotes for property and liability insurance, but they have been very high. He asks you to do a risk assessment of the premises. Have a look at your checklist, then write him an email advising him of the changes he has to make. Write 150-200 words. Response: Hi Friend,

I’ve gone through the risk assessment for your secondhand clothes shop, and based on the checklist, here are a few changes you can make to help lower your property and liability insurance premiums.

Building Condition: Since the building is old, it might be increasing your premiums. Consider investing in some basic repairs, especially for plumbing and electrical systems. Insurance companies often view buildings with outdated infrastructure as higher risks.

Security: Installing security systems like an alarm, CCTV, and better locks will lower the risk of theft and vandalism. Many insurers offer discounts for properties with enhanced security measures.

Fire Safety: Adding fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, and possibly sprinklers could help reduce the risk of fire-related claims. These improvements may also make your insurance premiums more manageable.

Liability Coverage: Since the building is older, consider limiting your liability coverage to match the size and layout of the premises. If possible, raise your deductible to reduce premiums.

Let me know if you need help coordinating any of these changes!

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a paragraph describing how robots are being used in your country. How do you feel about them? In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Robots are being used in many ways in my country, helping in industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and even at home. In factories, robots are used for tasks like assembling products, welding, and packing. They work quickly and accurately, helping to make products faster and at a lower cost. In healthcare, robots assist in surgeries, making procedures more precise, and some robots help take care of elderly people or deliver medicine in hospitals.

While robots offer many benefits, they also have some downsides. One concern is that they may replace human jobs, especially in factories. This can lead to unemployment for people who rely on those jobs. Another issue is that robots depend on technology, and if that technology fails or is hacked, it could cause problems. However, on the positive side, robots can improve safety by doing dangerous jobs and help people in ways that humans can't, like performing delicate surgeries.

Overall, robots can improve life in many ways, but we need to carefully balance their use to avoid harm to society.</input>",01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01,16.0,4,4,0,True,0.3943,"{'Score 0': 0.0014, 'Score 1': 0.0052, 'Score 2': 0.0607, 'Score 3': 0.2959, 'Score 4': 0.3943, 'Score 5': 0.2427}"

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a complex and evolving issue, and it’s important to consider both sides of the debate. I firmly believe that companies do have a responsibility to society, not just their shareholders. While it’s true that businesses exist to generate profit, they cannot do so in isolation. Companies rely on communities for labor, resources, and customers. In this sense, the argument for CSR, as highlighted by lil@213, is compelling: it’s a two-way street. When businesses contribute positively to the communities they operate in, they not only help the public but also create an environment where they can continue to thrive.

Furthermore, as Jack@MSU notes, CSR makes good business sense. In today's world, consumers are increasingly driven by values, not just product quality. Companies with a strong CSR track record build consumer trust, leading to higher loyalty and long-term profitability. This shift in consumer behavior makes CSR an investment in the company’s future.

On the other hand, some critics, like theG8T and JackD_92, argue that the primary role of business is to maximize shareholder value, and CSR can often serve as a marketing tool rather than a genuine effort to drive change. While there is some truth in this view, it doesn’t diminish the growing pressure on companies to contribute positively to the world.

In conclusion, CSR isn’t just a “nice-to-have” anymore—it’s essential for businesses to remain relevant, ethical, and sustainable in a world that increasingly values social responsibility.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: Use the information in the notes to write an informative text about NAFTA, or write about a trade agreement your country is a part of. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: he North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a landmark trade accord between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which came into effect in January 1994 after years of negotiation. Its primary goal was to eliminate or significantly reduce customs duties and trade barriers among the three member countries, thereby promoting free trade and economic integration across North America.

NAFTA had a profound impact on trade relations, particularly in sectors like agriculture. For example, it facilitated the large-scale export of Mexican fruits and vegetables to the U.S., enhancing food availability and lowering prices. The agreement also encouraged cross-border investments and the development of integrated supply chains, especially in manufacturing and automotive industries.

However, NAFTA’s effects were not uniformly positive. While it boosted overall trade and economic growth, it also led to job displacements in certain industries, particularly in manufacturing sectors in the U.S. and Canada. In Mexico, small-scale farmers faced increased competition from subsidized U.S. agricultural products.

Despite these challenges, NAFTA is widely regarded as beneficial to all three countries, laying the foundation for deeper economic cooperation. It was eventually replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2020, which updated and modernized many of its provisions.

Response: Nowadays, students face new challenges which not always it is easy to find a way to solve them. It is important to realize the level of confidence the students have to support them in the right way to handle their knowledge, for instance, when they feel comfortable or already know something it is a lower support to keep studying a subject or topic.

Half-human and half-cobra, Nagas are believed to dwell in deep underground realms, especially beneath rivers, lakes, and sacred mountains. These beings appear throughout Hindu and Buddhist traditions, often as guardians of treasure, nature, or ancient wisdom.
In Hindu mythology, Nagas are descendants of Kashyapa and Kadru and are led by the mighty serpent king Shesha, who coils beneath Lord Vishnu as a divine bed. Another famous Naga, Vasuki, was used as a rope during the churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthan), a pivotal cosmic event.
Nagas are both benevolent and wrathful. They are known to bless those who honor them, yet bring drought or misfortune to those who offend them or desecrate their abodes. In parts of India, particularly in Kerala and Assam, Nagas are worshipped with great reverence, with entire festivals like Nag Panchami dedicated to them.

Dear Team,

I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to take a moment to highlight our current priorities and share a quick update.

Our top priority right now is the US client design project. Although progress has been somewhat slow, we’re still on track. Please keep up the great work, as a strong performance here could lead to future collaboration with this client.

Secondly, we’re preparing for some staffing changes in Q2, with two team members set to leave. Finding suitable replacements is essential, so if you know of any potential candidates, either within your network or beyond, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly.

Lastly, regarding the marketing media reorganization: this project is currently on hold due to its complexity and limited relevance to our current needs. We’ll revisit it when the timing is better.

Thanks again for your dedication and efforts. Let’s keep pushing forward on the priorities that matter most.

Best regards,

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: You are a journalist for a financial magazine. You've been asked by your editor to write a report on the performance of the Hang Seng (HSI) stock market index. You have some notes and a graph as your guide. Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. Response: *Hang Seng Index (HSI) Performance Report*

The Hang Seng Index (HSI), a benchmark for the Hong Kong stock market, has experienced fluctuations in recent trading sessions. According to our analysis, the HSI has been influenced by global economic trends, investor sentiment, and sector-specific news.

Over the past quarter, the HSI has shown resilience, with a slight increase of 2.5%. However, volatility has been a hallmark, with the index experiencing swings of up to 500 points in a single session. Technology and finance sectors have driven gains, while economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions have weighed on investor confidence.

The graph indicates a strong correlation between the HSI's performance and global market trends. As the Hong Kong economy continues to navigate challenges, investors will be watching key indicators, such as GDP growth and trade balances, for signs of recovery. With its diverse sector representation, the HSI remains a crucial barometer for market sentiment. As the economy evolves, the HSI's performance will be closely monitored by investors and analysts alike. Correction: <input>*Hang Seng Index (HSI) Performance Report*

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Free writing is often considered a foundational technique in the writing process due to its liberating nature. By setting aside concerns about correctness or coherence, writers can focus purely on the act of writing, allowing their subconscious to surface ideas that might be stifled by self-editing. This uninhibited flow of thoughts can be particularly useful in overcoming writer's block—a common challenge where the pressure to produce perfect prose prevents any prose from being produced at all.

The beauty of free writing lies in its unpredictability. Writers often find themselves exploring tangents or uncovering themes they hadn’t initially considered. This can lead to unexpected connections between ideas, providing a rich tapestry of material to draw from in later stages of writing. Once the raw material is generated, writers can start identifying patterns or themes that resonate, using techniques like symbolism to add depth or metaphor to convey complex emotions and ideas more vividly.

After free writing, focused free writing can be employed to hone in on specific aspects of the text that seem promising. This involves taking the initial stream of consciousness and directing it towards a particular topic or theme, allowing writers to develop and elaborate on ideas that emerged during the initial free writing session.

Loop writing is another technique that builds on the foundation of free writing. It involves taking a single idea or sentence from the free writing piece and using it as a prompt for another round of writing. This iterative process can deepen exploration and understanding, leading to more nuanced content.

Listing is another technique that can complement free writing. By creating lists related to themes, characters, or settings, writers can organize their thoughts and identify elements that need more development. This can lead to a clearer structure when drafting more formal versions of their work.

Hyperbole and metaphor can be particularly effective in refining the emotional impact and expressive power of the writing. Hyperbole, with its exaggerated statements, can emphasize key points or evoke strong feelings, while metaphor can encapsulate complex ideas in relatable imagery, creating a bridge between the abstract and the tangible.

Symbolism adds another layer of meaning to writing. By embedding symbols into a narrative, writers can convey themes and messages subtly, inviting readers to interpret and find deeper significance in the text.

In essence, while free writing provides the raw material and initial inspiration, these other techniques serve as tools to refine, structure, and enrich the writing, allowing for a more polished and impactful final product. Each technique has its place in the writing process, and the most effective writers often employ a combination, depending on the needs of their work and the message they wish to convey.

Here are some ideas for you, and I have prioritized them.

1. I recommend cutting everyone back to 36hrs a week. It may save around $300 per person and $15,000 for the whole company monthly. 

2. For business traveling, we should reduce the expenses that are not needed or consider economic alternatives such as driving their own car instead of renting.

3. I strongly recommend that a 5% layoff of employees will be only as a last resort.

Hope these proposals will help us catch up on the budget.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: You are a journalist for a financial magazine. You've been asked by your editor to write a report on the performance of the Hang Seng (HSI) stock market index. You have some notes and a graph as your guide. Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. Response: Over the past six months, the Hang Seng Index (HSI), which is the main stock market index in Hong Kong, has shown a strong and steady upward trend. This rise is mainly driven by significant investment flows coming from Mainland China. Sectors such as Properties and Utilities have performed particularly well, with their sub-indices increasing sharply. This suggests that investors are confident in long-term infrastructure and real estate development supported by China’s economic influence.

Six months ago, the HSI was at a relatively low level of 20,956 points. Since then, it has climbed consistently to reach a recent high of 27,499 points. This substantial growth reflects both external interest and local economic strength.

According to market analysts, the index is expected to continue its positive momentum in the coming year. The outlook is optimistic, largely because of ongoing foreign investments and increasing internal demand within Hong Kong. These factors are likely to support continued growth across major industries represented in the index.

Dear Boss,

I hope this email finds you well. As we look ahead, there are a couple of key challenges that I believe we should be mindful of.

Firstly, increasing competition in our industry could affect our market share. To tackle this, we should focus on differentiating our services through innovation and customer-centric solutions. Strengthening our brand identity will also help maintain customer loyalty.

Secondly, the rapid pace of technological change presents both an opportunity and a threat. We must invest in continuous training for our team to ensure we're using the latest tools efficiently. Moreover, adopting new technologies will help us stay ahead in the market.

I believe addressing these challenges proactively will help secure our future growth and success.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Review your notes and write a case report stating who was found guilty and why. Briefly comment on whether you found the verdict appropriate. Write 150-200 words. Response: In this case, the plaintiffs, the Byron family, filed a tort action for trespassing against Medina. According to their account, Medina unlawfully entered their home at night, causing severe distress and fear. Although there were claims that valuables might have been taken, no specific items were mentioned. The defendant argued that he believed the house was empty, was scared, and only sought temporary shelter. However, it was confirmed that Medina ransacked various areas of the home, intensifying the sense of threat experienced by the family. The court ruled that Medina’s actions constituted criminal trespassing. As a result, he was fined 1,000 monetary units, to be paid in two installments—one immediately. Additionally, the court sentenced Medina to 300 hours of community service. The verdict underscores the seriousness of unlawful entry, even when no physical harm is caused, especially when it results in emotional trauma to the occupants.

Response: There has been lot of legends about so many creatures which look unreal but people talk about it in different forums. Movies and TV series were made adding some more fiction to these legends. Though I have not sighted any of these creatures but I am always fascinated by the fact that Dinosaurs existed some thousands of years ago. It all started when I watched the movie Jurassic Park. After watching this movie I was forced to think if such creatures existed at any time and then I did some reading and got to know some more information. Even till today I keep reading different material on the internet which talks about the dinosaurs. I wonder how this creatures survived in those times like did they had enough food to eat, move around and more importantly how did human if they existed during that times survived from these creatures. It also makes me wonder how so many animals became extinct but human race only prospered and increased in numbers. How they were able to rule the world.

Coming back to the dinosaurs, so far the proofs that we have only suggest there might be some large animals that existed but that there is no proof that they would have been so large as they show in some movies and also if they were so dangerous at all.

White Space Associates Denounces False Rumors About Company Operations

 As you may have heard, a recent article in the press falsely claimed that share prices for White Space Associates have dropped. We want to be absolutely clear: these rumors are complete nonsense.

White Space Associates is in a position of strength. Just as construction is beginning on the new Mishima Corporation headquarters, we are proud to remind everyone that we beat 20 other top agencies to secure this prestigious contract. Mr. Mishima himself personally approved our design, which is a testament to the quality of our work and the trust our clients place in us.

Furthermore, over the past three years, White Space Associates has experienced a steady rise in profits. We have secured three major contracts that will fuel our continued success in the coming years.

We take these malicious rumors very seriously, and our legal team is already taking action to seek compensation from those responsible for spreading them.

To our clients, partners, and stakeholders: we want to remind you that we are dedicated to protecting your interests, as well as our own. Rest assured, we are moving forward with confidence and continue to deliver world-class architectural designs.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: My favorite city in Argentina is Buenos Aires, a bustling metropolis known for its European-style architecture, vibrant culture, and passionate tango dance. This dynamic city is contrasted sharply with the serene and awe-inspiring natural beauty of Patagonia. Buenos Aires, often referred to as the “Paris of South America,” is a city that never sleeps. Its streets are filled with lively cafes, historic theaters, and grand avenues. The neighborhoods, such as Palermo and San Telmo, each have their unique charm, offering a blend of old-world elegance and modern vibrancy.

Then, there is Patagonia, a region located at the southern end of South America, shared by Argentina and Chile. Patagonia is renowned for its dramatic landscapes, including the towering Andes mountains, vast glaciers, and stunning national parks like Los Glaciares and Torres del Paine. Unlike the urban excitement of Buenos Aires, Patagonia offers a tranquil and remote experience where nature’s grandeur takes center stage.

While Buenos Aires captivates with its rich cultural heritage, architectural beauty, and lively atmosphere, Patagonia enchants with its pristine wilderness, breathtaking scenery, and opportunities for adventure and exploration. Buenos Aires' charm lies in its ability to blend history, culture, and modernity seamlessly, creating a city that is both cosmopolitan and deeply rooted in tradition. In contrast, Patagonia’s allure is its untouched landscapes and the sense of peace and wonder they invoke. Together, these two destinations highlight the diverse experiences that Argentina has to offer, from the vibrant city life in Buenos Aires to the serene natural wonders of Patagonia.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: You are writing to Harry, a new manager in your company. He wants advice on how to effectively motivate his team and what strategies to avoid. Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Dear Harry,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some strategies for effectively motivating your team, along with a few pitfalls to avoid.

Firstly, incentivize your employees. When they see that the company's success translates to their own success, it can be a powerful motivator. Additionally, take an active interest in their career development. Offering additional training and mentorship can make a significant difference.

It's also crucial to emphasize a healthy work-life balance. Recognize that your employees have lives outside of work, and respecting this balance can lead to happier, more productive team members. Listening to your employees is equally important. When they feel heard, even if they're voicing complaints, their overall satisfaction and productivity improve.

Treat your subordinates with the same respect you would expect from your superiors. This fosters a positive and respectful work environment.

On the flip side, avoid behaviors that can demotivate your staff. Disrespecting subordinates, taking credit for their work, losing your temper, unfairly blaming them, and failing to acknowledge good work can all have negative impacts.

By focusing on these positive strategies and avoiding the negative behaviors, you can create a more motivated and effective team.

It is curious to contemplate the similarities and differences between stories, as they sometimes are quite similar yet they are told from very distant places.

Particularly, Mexico is known for the variety of legendary creatures their citizens tell stories about like ghosts, witches and scary animals. Let's take for example ""The Nahual"".

The nahual has its origin in the nahuatl local language, meaning hidden disguise. It is a create that can transform into an animal and it's often described as a sort of sorcerer who can transform for the practice of witchcraft.

In the nahuatl culture, it was believed that everyone borns with an animal spirit who protects and guides us. The nahual then, seeks to incarnate their spirit animal to improve their skills.

In conclusion, the nahual is an interesting creature, often confused as something with evil and malicious intentions. However, as I've described previously, they are beings who are merely in a journey of knowledge for the ancient world of their gods using the nature around them.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Review your notes and write a case report stating who was found guilty and why. Briefly comment on whether you found the verdict appropriate. Write 150-200 words. Response: In the case of Medina v. Byron, Medina was found guilty of trespassing. The incident occurred when Medina broke into Byron’s home during the night, believing the house was empty and seeking shelter. Upon entering the property, Medina caused distress and terror to the family. Although it was not established that any valuables were stolen, the emotional impact on the victims was clear. The defendant’s actions were deemed to constitute trespassing, a criminal offense under the law, despite the claim of seeking shelter.

The court imposed a fine of $1,000, payable in two installments, along with 300 hours of community service. The fine was intended to hold Medina accountable for the unlawful entry, while the community service served as a rehabilitative measure.

In my opinion, the verdict seems appropriate given the circumstances. Although Medina's intentions were not malicious, the act of trespassing and the distress caused to the family warranted legal consequences. The combination of a financial penalty and community service strikes a balance between punishment and rehabilitation, reflecting the seriousness of the offense while offering an opportunity for the defendant to contribute positively to the community.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Write a summary of no more than 50-60 words about the case. Use the words below. This is a non-graded activity. Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.

In the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.

During the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.

Hi, there.
I am so excited about coming to work at your company!
But I have a question about the office and the culture before I start.

Please give me some details about the general company culture and the office environment, so i know to except when I arrive.

 I'd like to know about work-life balance. What are the working hours? Is the atmosphere serious or fun? I'd also like to know about the team. How many people do we have? What about social events? Do employees go out and have fun together?

Thanks!

Response: Negotiations office furniture new building

When we built a new we need new office furniture, writing desk, chair and meeting table. At our regular we need three offer suppliers because it cost more than 20,000 €. We had with all suppliers a meeting and tell them what we need and what they have, because alle the same but a little different. 
After three weeks we have all offers from the suppliers and we do a analysis it. The best gives us an offer of 24,000 € and the last 30,000 €. My budget to make the contract was 20,000 €. First we check if we can reduce something, because we need it in the future. There was nothing. 

Also we start we cheapest supplier, a say to him we want a bulk discount. He say can not give us a discount far that what we want. He tell us we don,t focus too much on preliminary offer. He make us an offer to change a different equipment requirement an office chair not our standard but OK.

We discuss with him and found a solution. The total price at the end was 19,000 €. At last we talk with the second supplier it was no way, he has no solution for us. 
Finally we speak with the first supplier, honest and fair and he gives us a final offer of 18,500 €. For me mind it was a win-win situation, in the future we will buy office furniture from him.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The dragon is one of the most iconic creatures in legends around the world, including Italy. Unlike its eastern counterpart, the Western dragon is depicted as a massive, winged, fire-breathing beast with tough scales and a long, spiked tail. In European folklore, it symbolizes power, destruction, and greed. Often, dragons are seen as the ultimate challenge for heroes, guarding ancient ruins or hidden treasures.

In Italy, one famous legend tells the story of Tarantasio, a serpent-like dragon said to live in Lake Gerundo, in Lombardy. According to the tale, it terrorized local villages by poisoning the water and devouring cattle until a brave knight finally defeated it.

In modern culture, dragons remain popular in fantasy literature and movies. In The Lord of the Rings, Smaug is a cunning and greedy dragon who hoards gold in the Lonely Mountain. In Harry Potter, dragons are powerful magical creatures used in the Triwizard Tournament. These stories continue to inspire our imagination, keeping the legend of dragons alive.

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Learning a new language can be an exciting yet challenging journey. Language students often face several issues and challenges that can impact their progress and motivation. What are some common obstacles they encounter, and how can they overcome them?

One major challenge is pronunciation. Many students struggle with mastering the sounds and intonations of a new language, which can lead to misunderstandings and frustration. To tackle this, students can practice with native speakers, use language learning apps, and engage in listening exercises to improve their pronunciation.

Another issue is vocabulary retention. Memorizing new words and phrases can be daunting, especially when they don't seem to stick. Techniques such as spaced repetition, flashcards, and incorporating new vocabulary into daily conversations can help reinforce learning.

Grammar is another hurdle. Understanding and applying grammatical rules can be complex, leading to errors and confusion. Students can benefit from studying grammar in context, using language learning resources, and seeking feedback from teachers or language exchange partners.

Cultural differences also play a role. Language is deeply intertwined with culture, and students may find it challenging to grasp idiomatic expressions, humor, and social norms. Immersing oneself in the culture through media, travel, and interaction with native speakers can provide valuable insights and enhance language learning.

Lastly, motivation can wane over time. Maintaining enthusiasm and consistency is crucial for language acquisition. Setting realistic goals, celebrating small achievements, and finding enjoyable ways to practice can keep students motivated.

By addressing these challenges with effective strategies, language students can navigate their learning journey more smoothly and achieve their goals.

My friend, May, is a creature of habit. Every Tuesday, she works from her favorite corner table at ""The Daily Coffee,"" a cozy coffee shop downtown. One Tuesday, however, her routine was delightfully disrupted.

She was deeply engrossed in her work when she noticed a man struggling with a stack of books at the counter. He was clearly flustered, and a few books had already tumbled to the floor. Without thinking, May rose and helped him gather the scattered volumes.

The man, whose name was Lucas, thanked her profusely and, as a gesture of gratitude, offered to buy her a coffee. They struck up a conversation, discovering a shared love for classic literature and indie music. Time flew by, and May found herself genuinely enjoying their impromptu meeting.

They exchanged numbers, and over the next few weeks, they met again at The Daily Grind, their conversations flowing as easily as the coffee. Maya, who usually kept to herself, found herself looking forward to Tuesdays.

It wasn't a grand, dramatic event, but a simple, unexpected connection forged over spilled books and shared interests. Sometimes, the most ordinary days can lead to the most extraordinary moments. May's Tuesday routine was forever changed, proving that even in the midst of a busy city, a little kindness and a shared love for coffee can lead to something special.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: he debate on whether companies have a responsibility to society or solely to their shareholders is a complex one that reflects broader questions about the role of business in the contemporary world. Both perspectives present valid arguments, and my position leans towards a balanced approach that acknowledges the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) while recognizing the need for profitability.

On one hand, companies undoubtedly have a significant impact on the communities in which they operate. This impact extends beyond economic contributions to include environmental and social dimensions. As lil@213 mentioned, businesses and communities exist in a symbiotic relationship. Companies benefit from the resources, labor, and infrastructure provided by these communities, and, in return, they have a moral obligation to contribute positively to societal well-being. Moreover, as Jack@MSU highlighted, CSR can enhance a company's reputation and foster customer loyalty, ultimately benefiting the bottom line. Consumers today are increasingly aware of and concerned about the ethical practices of the companies they support, making CSR not just a moral choice but a strategic business decision.

On the other hand, critics like theG8T remind us of Milton Friedman's view that a corporation's primary responsibility is to its shareholders. While profit is undoubtedly a key driver of business success, this perspective can be too narrow, especially in an era where social and environmental challenges are pressing. JackD_92 points out that CSR efforts are sometimes perceived as mere marketing strategies rather than genuine contributions, which can undermine their effectiveness and authenticity.

A middle ground can be found by recognizing that businesses can pursue profit while also addressing societal needs. This is not only feasible but often beneficial in the long term. Companies that integrate CSR into their core operations can innovate, improve risk management, and create a sustainable competitive advantage. It's also important to note, as patty925 suggests, that governments play a crucial role in setting the regulatory framework within which businesses operate. Effective regulation can guide and incentivize companies to act in socially responsible ways without usurping the role of businesses in driving innovation and economic growth.

I’d like to begin by highlighting one of the key achievements this quarter — the renewal of our partnership with Crum. This wasn’t just a routine agreement; the organization specifically praised our dedication to quality, which reflects the collective effort behind our work.

That said, this success didn’t come without its challenges. Just three months ago, we were dealing with unresolved defects that put our client relationships at risk. On top of that, there were several minor technical issues that added complexity.

To overcome these obstacles, we introduced two major changes. First, the update delivery process was revised. Second, Quality Assurance procedures were strengthened. These improvements wouldn’t have been possible without strong collaboration across teams — something I believe all of us can be proud of.

Looking ahead, we’re committed to providing even more proactive support to prevent similar issues and ensure continued satisfaction for this partner and others we work with.

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Language learning can be a rewarding yet challenging journey. Students often face several issues and challenges that can hinder their progress. 

**What are the common difficulties in language learning?** One major challenge is **pronunciation**. Many students struggle with mastering the sounds and intonation patterns of a new language, which can lead to misunderstandings. **How does grammar affect language learning?** Grammar rules can be complex and different from the student's native language, making it difficult to construct sentences correctly. **What role does vocabulary play?** Building a robust vocabulary is essential, but memorizing new words and their meanings can be overwhelming.

**How do cultural differences impact learning?** Cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions can be confusing and hard to grasp. **What about motivation and confidence?** Maintaining motivation and confidence is crucial; students often feel discouraged by slow progress or fear of making mistakes. **How can practice opportunities be limited?** Limited opportunities to practice speaking with native speakers can impede fluency development.

Addressing these challenges requires patience, consistent practice, and sometimes seeking additional resources or support from teachers and peers.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: Buying a home in France, especially near Paris, can be both exciting and challenging. Prices are very high in this region, and the process involves several steps. For many people, one of the most complicated parts is applying for a home loan. It usually requires a lot of paperwork, including proof of income, bank statements, tax documents, and other financial details. This can be time-consuming and sometimes stressful.

Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, interest rates have increased significantly, making borrowing more expensive. Although rates are starting to stabilize in 2025, they are still higher than they were a few years ago. This means that buying property now often requires a larger budget or a longer loan term.

To make things easier, many people choose to work with professionals. A real estate agent helps find suitable properties and negotiate the price, while a mortgage broker assists with finding the best loan offer and managing the application process. These experts can be very helpful, especially for first-time buyers.

Overall, the process of buying a home in France is not necessarily difficult, but it does take time, preparation, and a good understanding of the system. With the help of the right professionals and a realistic budget, it is possible to become a homeowner—even in expensive areas like Paris and its suburbs, such as Vincennes, where I currently live and rent a flat with my spouse.

"Prompt Level: 9.0 Prompt: Write a summary of a negotiation. It could be something you did at work, something you purchased on your own, or a summary of what happened in the movies in this unit. What was the preliminary offer? What happened during the negotiations? What was the final deal? Type in the input box. Write 100-150 words. This activity is non-graded. Response: Hi Joan, this is the summary of the negotiation we had for the kettles. The preliminary offer was $350 per kettle, which included a six-month service plan. We discussed and tried to find a fair price for both of us, and at last, we agreed that $300 would work since we were buying in bulk. Additionally, we discussed how we can change the terms and conditions in the service plan because it only covers malfunctions, but not all other cases that might happen within the specified time. We finally agreed to increase the service plan to 1 year with everything catered for. Correction: <input>Hi Joan, this is the summary of the negotiation we had for the kettles.
