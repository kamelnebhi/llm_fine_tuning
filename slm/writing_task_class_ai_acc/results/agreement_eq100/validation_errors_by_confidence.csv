"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Free writing is often considered a foundational technique in the writing process due to its liberating nature. By setting aside concerns about correctness or coherence, writers can focus purely on the act of writing, allowing their subconscious to surface ideas that might be stifled by self-editing. This uninhibited flow of thoughts can be particularly useful in overcoming writer's block—a common challenge where the pressure to produce perfect prose prevents any prose from being produced at all.

The beauty of free writing lies in its unpredictability. Writers often find themselves exploring tangents or uncovering themes they hadn’t initially considered. This can lead to unexpected connections between ideas, providing a rich tapestry of material to draw from in later stages of writing. Once the raw material is generated, writers can start identifying patterns or themes that resonate, using techniques like symbolism to add depth or metaphor to convey complex emotions and ideas more vividly.

After free writing, focused free writing can be employed to hone in on specific aspects of the text that seem promising. This involves taking the initial stream of consciousness and directing it towards a particular topic or theme, allowing writers to develop and elaborate on ideas that emerged during the initial free writing session.

Loop writing is another technique that builds on the foundation of free writing. It involves taking a single idea or sentence from the free writing piece and using it as a prompt for another round of writing. This iterative process can deepen exploration and understanding, leading to more nuanced content.

Listing is another technique that can complement free writing. By creating lists related to themes, characters, or settings, writers can organize their thoughts and identify elements that need more development. This can lead to a clearer structure when drafting more formal versions of their work.

Hyperbole and metaphor can be particularly effective in refining the emotional impact and expressive power of the writing. Hyperbole, with its exaggerated statements, can emphasize key points or evoke strong feelings, while metaphor can encapsulate complex ideas in relatable imagery, creating a bridge between the abstract and the tangible.

Symbolism adds another layer of meaning to writing. By embedding symbols into a narrative, writers can convey themes and messages subtly, inviting readers to interpret and find deeper significance in the text.

In essence, while free writing provides the raw material and initial inspiration, these other techniques serve as tools to refine, structure, and enrich the writing, allowing for a more polished and impactful final product. Each technique has its place in the writing process, and the most effective writers often employ a combination, depending on the needs of their work and the message they wish to convey.

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: You're going to write about an interesting, fictional event that happened to a friend. Write your blog post. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The Unexpected Coffee Shop Connection

My friend, May, is a creature of habit. Every Tuesday, she works from her favorite corner table at ""The Daily Coffee,"" a cozy coffee shop downtown. One Tuesday, however, her routine was delightfully disrupted.

She was deeply engrossed in her work when she noticed a man struggling with a stack of books at the counter. He was clearly flustered, and a few books had already tumbled to the floor. Without thinking, May rose and helped him gather the scattered volumes.

The man, whose name was Lucas, thanked her profusely and, as a gesture of gratitude, offered to buy her a coffee. They struck up a conversation, discovering a shared love for classic literature and indie music. Time flew by, and May found herself genuinely enjoying their impromptu meeting.

They exchanged numbers, and over the next few weeks, they met again at The Daily Grind, their conversations flowing as easily as the coffee. Maya, who usually kept to herself, found herself looking forward to Tuesdays.

It wasn't a grand, dramatic event, but a simple, unexpected connection forged over spilled books and shared interests. Sometimes, the most ordinary days can lead to the most extraordinary moments. May's Tuesday routine was forever changed, proving that even in the midst of a busy city, a little kindness and a shared love for coffee can lead to something special.

Thank you for your feedback! I’ve revised the speech to improve cohesion and ensure smooth transitions between points. I’ve also varied the references to Crum to avoid repetition. Here’s the updated version:

Opening:

We are delighted to announce the renewal of our partnership with Crum. This achievement underscores our team’s dedication and hard work. As an added bonus, our commitment to quality has been recognized and praised by our partners.

Body:

Three months ago, we faced a significant challenge with unresolved defects in our products. These issues were causing disruptions and dissatisfaction among our customers. Additionally, we encountered several minor technical problems that further complicated the situation.

To address these challenges, we implemented two key solutions:

Changed Update Delivery: We revised our update delivery process to ensure more timely and efficient rollouts. This change has helped us minimize disruptions and provide a smoother experience for our customers.
Improved Quality Assurance Processes: We enhanced our Quality Assurance (QA) processes to identify and resolve defects more effectively. This improvement has significantly reduced the number of issues and increased the overall reliability of our products.
These solutions were only possible because of the excellent cross-team collaboration within our organization. By working together, we were able to overcome these challenges and improve our service quality.

Closing:

Looking ahead, we are committed to providing further support to avoid any future problems with our customers. Our focus will remain on continuous improvement and maintaining the high standards that have earned us the trust and praise of our partners. By prioritizing quality and customer satisfaction, we aim to strengthen our partnerships and achieve even greater success in the future.

Let me know if you have any questions or further suggestions.

Dear Team,

I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to take a moment to highlight our current priorities and share a quick update.

Our top priority right now is the US client design project. Although progress has been somewhat slow, we’re still on track. Please keep up the great work, as a strong performance here could lead to future collaboration with this client.

Secondly, we’re preparing for some staffing changes in Q2, with two team members set to leave. Finding suitable replacements is essential, so if you know of any potential candidates, either within your network or beyond, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly.

Lastly, regarding the marketing media reorganization: this project is currently on hold due to its complexity and limited relevance to our current needs. We’ll revisit it when the timing is better.

Thanks again for your dedication and efforts. Let’s keep pushing forward on the priorities that matter most.

Best regards,
Maria

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: Buying a home in India is a major life decision and involves a lengthy and sometimes complex process. First, one must decide on the location and budget. Housing prices vary significantly across the country. In metro cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore, real estate is extremely expensive, while smaller cities and towns offer more affordable options.

Applying for a home loan requires various documents, including proof of identity, Income, address, and property details. Banks and housing finance companies often request salary slips, bank statements, PAN cards, and employment proof. Though the process has become more streamlined with digital platforms, it can still be time-consuming due to verifications and paperwork.

Interest rates in India vary depending on the bank and the applicant's credit profile. As of now, the average home loan interest rate ranges between 8% and 10%. Many people use areal estate agent or broker to find suitable properties and handle negotiations, although it's not mandatory. For loans, some also use mortgage advisors who help compare offers from various lenders.

Overall, while the process is manageable with the right guidance, it can feel overwhelming for first-time buyers. However, government schemes like PMAY(Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana) provides subsidies that help make housing more affordable for middle-and lower-income families.

I’m Ticiana, and it’s a pleasure to welcome you to Frisko Shipping. Today, I’d like to share a bit about our company’s journey and what makes us a unique and exciting place to work.

Frisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko. What started as a small venture has now grown into a global powerhouse with locations in 20 cities around the world and more than 5,000 dedicated employees. Last year, we achieved a remarkable profit of 5 million dollars and captured 10 percent of the global market.

But beyond the numbers, what truly sets us apart is our team. We expect our new employees to be motivated and enthusiastic, ready to contribute to our ongoing success.

Let me share a personal story about Bill Frisko, our founder. Many of you might not know this, but Bill’s inspiration to start Frisko Shipping came from a life-changing experience. He once fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. Miraculously, a passing ship saved his life. This event sparked his passion for shipping and led to the creation of our company. It’s a powerful reminder that inspiration can come from the most unexpected places.
As you embark on this journey with us, I encourage you to think about what inspires you and how you can bring that passion to your work here at Frisko Shipping. Let’s make waves together and continue to drive our company forward.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Visakhapatnam, also known as Vizag, is a lively city by the sea in Andhra Pradesh, India. It has beautiful beaches, green hills, and a mix of modern and traditional culture. Some popular places in Vizag are Ramakrishna Beach, Kailasagiri Hill Park, and the INS Kursura Submarine Museum. The city has good facilities like shopping malls, schools, and hospitals, making it a great place to live and visit. Vizag's mix of city life and cultural heritage attracts many people.

It is surrounded by green hills and beautiful nature, perfect for those who love the outdoors. Life in Narsipatnam is slower, and people know each other well. The town doesn't have as many modern facilities as Vizag, but it has a simple and charming atmosphere. The local markets, traditional festivals, and friendly people make it feel like home.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Among various writing methods, I find free writing and metaphor to be particularly useful. Free writing allows writers to tap into their subconscious mind, generating new ideas and perspectives. By writing freely without stopping or worrying about grammar, spelling, or coherence, writers can overcome writer's block and produce authentic content. This method helps to loosen up the writing muscles, making it easier to express thoughts and feelings.

Metaphor, on the other hand, enables writers to convey complex ideas and emotions in a concise and powerful way. By comparing two unlike things, metaphors create vivid imagery, making writing more engaging and memorable. Metaphors also allow writers to convey subtle shades of meaning, adding depth and nuance to their writing. When combined with free writing, metaphors can help writers to create rich, evocative, and authentic content that resonates with readers. Metaphorical writing uses comparisons to create vivid and evocative language, often to convey complex emotions and ideas.

I’d like to begin by highlighting one of the key achievements this quarter — the renewal of our partnership with Crum. This wasn’t just a routine agreement; the organization specifically praised our dedication to quality, which reflects the collective effort behind our work.

That said, this success didn’t come without its challenges. Just three months ago, we were dealing with unresolved defects that put our client relationships at risk. On top of that, there were several minor technical issues that added complexity.

To overcome these obstacles, we introduced two major changes. First, the update delivery process was revised. Second, Quality Assurance procedures were strengthened. These improvements wouldn’t have been possible without strong collaboration across teams — something I believe all of us can be proud of.

Looking ahead, we’re committed to providing even more proactive support to prevent similar issues and ensure continued satisfaction for this partner and others we work with.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: he debate on whether companies have a responsibility to society or solely to their shareholders is a complex one that reflects broader questions about the role of business in the contemporary world. Both perspectives present valid arguments, and my position leans towards a balanced approach that acknowledges the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) while recognizing the need for profitability.

On one hand, companies undoubtedly have a significant impact on the communities in which they operate. This impact extends beyond economic contributions to include environmental and social dimensions. As lil@213 mentioned, businesses and communities exist in a symbiotic relationship. Companies benefit from the resources, labor, and infrastructure provided by these communities, and, in return, they have a moral obligation to contribute positively to societal well-being. Moreover, as Jack@MSU highlighted, CSR can enhance a company's reputation and foster customer loyalty, ultimately benefiting the bottom line. Consumers today are increasingly aware of and concerned about the ethical practices of the companies they support, making CSR not just a moral choice but a strategic business decision.

On the other hand, critics like theG8T remind us of Milton Friedman's view that a corporation's primary responsibility is to its shareholders. While profit is undoubtedly a key driver of business success, this perspective can be too narrow, especially in an era where social and environmental challenges are pressing. JackD_92 points out that CSR efforts are sometimes perceived as mere marketing strategies rather than genuine contributions, which can undermine their effectiveness and authenticity.

A middle ground can be found by recognizing that businesses can pursue profit while also addressing societal needs. This is not only feasible but often beneficial in the long term. Companies that integrate CSR into their core operations can innovate, improve risk management, and create a sustainable competitive advantage. It's also important to note, as patty925 suggests, that governments play a crucial role in setting the regulatory framework within which businesses operate. Effective regulation can guide and incentivize companies to act in socially responsible ways without usurping the role of businesses in driving innovation and economic growth.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: The process of buying a home and applying for a home loan varies widely depending on the country, but it generally involves multiple steps and can range from straightforward to complex. Here's a general overview:
In many countries, purchasing a home begins with determining your budget and getting pre-approved for a mortgage. Pre-approval involves submitting documents such as proof of income, credit history, and identification to the lender. The process can be time-consuming, with multiple forms to fill out and requirements to meet. Some countries have streamlined online systems, while others still rely on more traditional paperwork.
Housing prices vary greatly depending on the location, with urban centers often being significantly more expensive than rural areas. In some regions, housing affordability is a major concern, and buyers may face stiff competition, especially in high-demand markets.
Interest rates on home loans depend on the economy, central bank policies, and the borrower's creditworthiness. Fixed-rate loans offer stability, while variable rates can fluctuate over time. As of 2024, many countries have seen fluctuating rates due to global economic conditions, ranging from as low as 3% to over 7% annually.
While using a real estate agent or mortgage broker isn't always mandatory, their expertise can be invaluable. Agents help navigate the housing market, and brokers assist in finding favorable loan terms. Both professionals can simplify a complex process but may add to the cost. Overall, buying a home requires thorough research, planning, and patience.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: One of my favorite places is the beach at sunrise. There's something magical about the calmness of the morning before the world wakes up. The air is fresh and crisp, with a slight saltiness that lingers. The sound of gentle waves rolling onto the shore has a peaceful rhythm that’s almost hypnotic. I love walking along the water's edge, feeling the cool sand beneath my feet, and watching the sky gradually light up in soft hues of pink, orange, and purple. The beauty of it is so calming and grounding, offering a sense of peace that's hard to find elsewhere. The sunrise marks a fresh start to the day, full of potential, and I often take a moment to reflect, breathe deeply, and simply enjoy the quiet. It's a place where I can reconnect with nature and myself, making it the perfect spot for relaxation and introspection.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Write a summary of no more than 50-60 words about the case. Use the words below. This is a non-graded activity. Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.

In the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.

During the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Robots are being used in many ways in the country today. They work in factories to build cars, pack goods, and help with farming. In hospitals, robots help doctors with surgeries and deliver medicines. Some restaurants use robots to serve food. I feel that robots are very useful and exciting. They can do hard work faster and more safely than people. Robots will help society by making work easier, saving time, and even helping in dangerous places like disaster areas. 

However, they might also cause problems. Some people may lose their jobs because robots can do the work instead. Also, if we depend too much on robots, people might lose some skills. Overall, robots will bring many good changes, but we must also be careful about how we use them.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: In recent years, the cult of celebrity has changed compared to the past.
In the past, people generelly became a celebrity by achieving something significant or being the best in sport or profession. The cult of celebrity was founded on genuine accomplishments and people often tried to follow and replicate the celibrity ideas to help make the world a better place.
Nowadays, celebrities are often celebrated not for genuine talent or achievements but for their skill to use of social media or participation in TV shows and reality programs. This means that some people, especially young people, develop a distorted view of real life. Some people have no idea that some celebtities use their influence for other scope like influence their culture and politics ideas, often for personal or ideological purposes. The last U.S. elections are an examples but similar topic can be observed worldwide.
I believe that this unhealthy culture could change if everyone unplugged from social media and start to think on their own principles.

Response: Good morning everyone. Thanks for coming along for the ride today. I'm here to share the story of our journey- one that's taken us through bumps, detours and breakthroughs and that now has us on a clear strong road forward. 
One of the biggest milestone on this road was reaching a renewed partnership with Crum. This wasn't just a pit stop, it was a major checkpoint, showing we are moved in the right direction and gaining momentum. 
Crum has decided to stay on the journey with us not just because of where we have been but because of where we are going. They have seen our persistence, our drive to improve and they are confident in the direction we are heading together.
They matched our commitment to quality with their trust, and it's that shared vision that keeps this partnership going forward. Our dedication to doing things right even when the roads get tough was what kept them on board.
But let's rewind a bit, about three months ago we hit some potholes. Minor defects and lingering in technical issues started to slow us down. They weren't major breakdowns but they had the potential to throw us off course.
So, we calibrated. We pulled over, took a hard look under the hood and made the necessary upgrades. We tightened our quality assurance engine, fine tuned our workflows, and checked every part of the process to ensure a smoother ride ahead.
As we look ahead, we are not just cruising we are accelerating with purpose. We are investing in stronger support system to make sure our teams and our partners avoid roadblocks altogether.

Hi,

Hope you are doing well!

I just had to share something a bit weird, a little exciting, and honestly kind of hilarious that happened recently.

So picture this. I was on a video call, fully focused, camera on, all professional - until halfway through the meeting, my smart speaker in the background suddenly decided it had something to say. Out of nowhere, it blurted out, ""I didn't quite catch that, could you repeat? - ""In the middle of someone presenting a financial update! I froze. Everyone paused. Then someone said, ""well even the AI is confused about these numbers"".

We all had a good laugh, and it actually turned into a mini icebreaker. Now I double-check that my device are on mute before any call.

Just a little reminder that even tech as a sense of humor.

Hi, there.

I have a problem I'd like your help with. I know what a creative writer you are. Could you take a look at the text below and rewrite it for me to make it more interesting? Here's the text:

Dear colleague,

This is to inform you of an upcoming change in company policy. Starting on the first Monday of next month, the company will be providing free breakfasts to all employees. We hope this will be a way to lessen the stress of trying to grab something to eat before getting to work, and also give us all a chance to socialize a bit before we start our day.

We're very pleased with our menu. We will be offering fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, bagels and doughnuts every day. In addition, we will have one hot item each day. This could be anything from scrambled eggs and potatoes to pancakes with maple syrup. We will also be offering fresh-brewed coffees and teas, along with fresh-squeezed orange and grapefruit juices.

I'd like everyone to be as excited as I am, and I'm hoping that, with your help and creativity, this new policy will be a big success.

Thanks for your help.

Here are some ideas for you, and I have prioritized them.

1. I recommend cutting everyone back to 36hrs a week. It may save around $300 per person and $15,000 for the whole company monthly. 

2. For business traveling, we should reduce the expenses that are not needed or consider economic alternatives such as driving their own car instead of renting.

3. I strongly recommend that a 5% layoff of employees will be only as a last resort.

Hope these proposals will help us catch up on the budget.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Throughout the years, many have claimed to have seen lots of strange and interesting creatures in their hometowns. It is curious to contemplate the similarities and differences between stories, as they sometimes are quite similar yet they are told from very distant places.

Particularly, Mexico is known for the variety of legendary creatures their citizens tell stories about like ghosts, witches and scary animals. Let's take for example ""The Nahual"".

The nahual has its origin in the nahuatl local language, meaning hidden disguise. It is a create that can transform into an animal and it's often described as a sort of sorcerer who can transform for the practice of witchcraft.

In the nahuatl culture, it was believed that everyone borns with an animal spirit who protects and guides us. The nahual then, seeks to incarnate their spirit animal to improve their skills.

In conclusion, the nahual is an interesting creature, often confused as something with evil and malicious intentions. However, as I've described previously, they are beings who are merely in a journey of knowledge for the ancient world of their gods using the nature around them.

The crew saw error messages about the nose landing gear and steering.
They flew by the control tower in San Jose, which confirmed the nose wheels were facing the wrong way.
The captain chose San Francisco for landing due to its better emergency support and longer runway.

Passengers were told about the gear issue and evacuation plans in case of an emergency.

I found two great options for our outdoor team-building event. The first is Team Builders of the World, which offers a wide range of inclusive games designed to build trust and team spirit. The second is Druid and Stone Corporate Team Building, which provides fun, low-stress activities across the country, ideal for team bonding and staying within budget.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a paragraph describing how robots are being used in your country. How do you feel about them? In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: “He replaced 10 men on the hose, so he does a very heavy job. When there is a forest fire, it is very exhausting and exposes the firefighters. It contributes a lot to this”, explained Fernanda Morelli, executive director of Ambipar Robotics.

The robot has an operating autonomy of 10 hours, withstands temperatures of up to 600°C for 15 minutes and also has a displacement mechanism that does not use rubber, but a bronze and aluminum mat that does not produce sparks on the floor.

This allows access to locations with fuel leaks without putting anyone at risk.
As it is operated by remote control from up to 300 meters away and with signal return via Wi-Fi, STW Response can be monitored by a control center. It has seven cameras located on the front, back and sides, as well as a thermal and a night camera.

During the biggest event in the oil and gas sector in Latin America, held from September 23 to 26 in Rio de Janeiro, STW Response was one of the attractions at the Ambipar stand. According to Morelli, he is ready to take action in the country.

“Ambipar is a specialist in risk management. So, she responds to a lot of emergencies. Today, the brigade members are wearing mufflers. They don’t have much technology and this equipment is an innovation.”
