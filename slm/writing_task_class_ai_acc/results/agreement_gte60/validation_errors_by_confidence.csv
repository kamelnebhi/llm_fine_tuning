"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Free writing is often considered a foundational technique in the writing process due to its liberating nature. By setting aside concerns about correctness or coherence, writers can focus purely on the act of writing, allowing their subconscious to surface ideas that might be stifled by self-editing. This uninhibited flow of thoughts can be particularly useful in overcoming writer's block—a common challenge where the pressure to produce perfect prose prevents any prose from being produced at all.

The beauty of free writing lies in its unpredictability. Writers often find themselves exploring tangents or uncovering themes they hadn’t initially considered. This can lead to unexpected connections between ideas, providing a rich tapestry of material to draw from in later stages of writing. Once the raw material is generated, writers can start identifying patterns or themes that resonate, using techniques like symbolism to add depth or metaphor to convey complex emotions and ideas more vividly.

After free writing, focused free writing can be employed to hone in on specific aspects of the text that seem promising. This involves taking the initial stream of consciousness and directing it towards a particular topic or theme, allowing writers to develop and elaborate on ideas that emerged during the initial free writing session.

Loop writing is another technique that builds on the foundation of free writing. It involves taking a single idea or sentence from the free writing piece and using it as a prompt for another round of writing. This iterative process can deepen exploration and understanding, leading to more nuanced content.

Listing is another technique that can complement free writing. By creating lists related to themes, characters, or settings, writers can organize their thoughts and identify elements that need more development. This can lead to a clearer structure when drafting more formal versions of their work.

Hyperbole and metaphor can be particularly effective in refining the emotional impact and expressive power of the writing. Hyperbole, with its exaggerated statements, can emphasize key points or evoke strong feelings, while metaphor can encapsulate complex ideas in relatable imagery, creating a bridge between the abstract and the tangible.

Symbolism adds another layer of meaning to writing. By embedding symbols into a narrative, writers can convey themes and messages subtly, inviting readers to interpret and find deeper significance in the text.

In essence, while free writing provides the raw material and initial inspiration, these other techniques serve as tools to refine, structure, and enrich the writing, allowing for a more polished and impactful final product. Each technique has its place in the writing process, and the most effective writers often employ a combination, depending on the needs of their work and the message they wish to convey.

My friend, May, is a creature of habit. Every Tuesday, she works from her favorite corner table at ""The Daily Coffee,"" a cozy coffee shop downtown. One Tuesday, however, her routine was delightfully disrupted.

She was deeply engrossed in her work when she noticed a man struggling with a stack of books at the counter. He was clearly flustered, and a few books had already tumbled to the floor. Without thinking, May rose and helped him gather the scattered volumes.

The man, whose name was Lucas, thanked her profusely and, as a gesture of gratitude, offered to buy her a coffee. They struck up a conversation, discovering a shared love for classic literature and indie music. Time flew by, and May found herself genuinely enjoying their impromptu meeting.

They exchanged numbers, and over the next few weeks, they met again at The Daily Grind, their conversations flowing as easily as the coffee. Maya, who usually kept to herself, found herself looking forward to Tuesdays.

It wasn't a grand, dramatic event, but a simple, unexpected connection forged over spilled books and shared interests. Sometimes, the most ordinary days can lead to the most extraordinary moments. May's Tuesday routine was forever changed, proving that even in the midst of a busy city, a little kindness and a shared love for coffee can lead to something special.

Thank you for your feedback! I’ve revised the speech to improve cohesion and ensure smooth transitions between points. I’ve also varied the references to Crum to avoid repetition. Here’s the updated version:

Opening:

We are delighted to announce the renewal of our partnership with Crum. This achievement underscores our team’s dedication and hard work. As an added bonus, our commitment to quality has been recognized and praised by our partners.

Body:

Three months ago, we faced a significant challenge with unresolved defects in our products. These issues were causing disruptions and dissatisfaction among our customers. Additionally, we encountered several minor technical problems that further complicated the situation.

To address these challenges, we implemented two key solutions:

Changed Update Delivery: We revised our update delivery process to ensure more timely and efficient rollouts. This change has helped us minimize disruptions and provide a smoother experience for our customers.
Improved Quality Assurance Processes: We enhanced our Quality Assurance (QA) processes to identify and resolve defects more effectively. This improvement has significantly reduced the number of issues and increased the overall reliability of our products.
These solutions were only possible because of the excellent cross-team collaboration within our organization. By working together, we were able to overcome these challenges and improve our service quality.

Closing:

Looking ahead, we are committed to providing further support to avoid any future problems with our customers. Our focus will remain on continuous improvement and maintaining the high standards that have earned us the trust and praise of our partners.

We understand there have been concerns regarding the stability of the construction business and rumors about our share prices potentially affecting your investments. We want to address these issues directly and reassure you of our strong position in the market.

Firstly, we want to stress that the rumors about our share prices are completely unfounded. While it is true that our share value experienced a drop two months ago, this was due to the resignation of our former CEO, Greg Johnson. Since then, we have welcomed Harry Levi as our new CEO. Harry is well-known and highly respected in the industry, and under his leadership, our share value has not only recovered but has also reached a historic high.

In this unstable market, we are committed to maintaining stability. We have secured three significant contracts for the coming three years, ensuring guaranteed profits and reinforcing our market position.

We deeply appreciate your loyalty and confidence in Future Foundations. We are excited about the company’s bright future and are committed to keeping you informed. To further boost your confidence, we will soon share our comprehensive five-year road map.

I’d like to begin by highlighting one of the key achievements this quarter — the renewal of our partnership with Crum. This wasn’t just a routine agreement; the organization specifically praised our dedication to quality, which reflects the collective effort behind our work.

That said, this success didn’t come without its challenges. Just three months ago, we were dealing with unresolved defects that put our client relationships at risk. On top of that, there were several minor technical issues that added complexity.

To overcome these obstacles, we introduced two major changes. First, the update delivery process was revised. Second, Quality Assurance procedures were strengthened. These improvements wouldn’t have been possible without strong collaboration across teams — something I believe all of us can be proud of.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Among various writing methods, I find free writing and metaphor to be particularly useful. Free writing allows writers to tap into their subconscious mind, generating new ideas and perspectives. By writing freely without stopping or worrying about grammar, spelling, or coherence, writers can overcome writer's block and produce authentic content. This method helps to loosen up the writing muscles, making it easier to express thoughts and feelings.

Metaphor, on the other hand, enables writers to convey complex ideas and emotions in a concise and powerful way. By comparing two unlike things, metaphors create vivid imagery, making writing more engaging and memorable. Metaphors also allow writers to convey subtle shades of meaning, adding depth and nuance to their writing. When combined with free writing, metaphors can help writers to create rich, evocative, and authentic content that resonates with readers. Metaphorical writing uses comparisons to create vivid and evocative language, often to convey complex emotions and ideas.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: Buying a home in India is a major life decision and involves a lengthy and sometimes complex process. First, one must decide on the location and budget. Housing prices vary significantly across the country. In metro cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore, real estate is extremely expensive, while smaller cities and towns offer more affordable options.

Applying for a home loan requires various documents, including proof of identity, Income, address, and property details. Banks and housing finance companies often request salary slips, bank statements, PAN cards, and employment proof. Though the process has become more streamlined with digital platforms, it can still be time-consuming due to verifications and paperwork.

Interest rates in India vary depending on the bank and the applicant's credit profile. As of now, the average home loan interest rate ranges between 8% and 10%. Many people use areal estate agent or broker to find suitable properties and handle negotiations, although it's not mandatory. For loans, some also use mortgage advisors who help compare offers from various lenders.

Overall, while the process is manageable with the right guidance, it can feel overwhelming for first-time buyers. However, government schemes like PMAY(Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana) provides subsidies that help make housing more affordable for middle-and lower-income families.

Dear Team,

I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to take a moment to highlight our current priorities and share a quick update.

Our top priority right now is the US client design project. Although progress has been somewhat slow, we’re still on track. Please keep up the great work, as a strong performance here could lead to future collaboration with this client.

Secondly, we’re preparing for some staffing changes in Q2, with two team members set to leave. Finding suitable replacements is essential, so if you know of any potential candidates, either within your network or beyond, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly.

Lastly, regarding the marketing media reorganization: this project is currently on hold due to its complexity and limited relevance to our current needs. We’ll revisit it when the timing is better.

Thanks again for your dedication and efforts. Let’s keep pushing forward on the priorities that matter most.

Best regards,

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Write a summary of no more than 50-60 words about the case. Use the words below. This is a non-graded activity. Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.

In the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.

During the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a paragraph describing how robots are being used in your country. How do you feel about them? In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Robots are now being used in India across various industries and sector. The are transforming the way how industries used to work and it is also impacting our daily life. In healthcare robotic surgery is making the surgery easy and helping people to recover faster. Use of AI in healthcare is helping people staying in rural area to access the best medical facility of the country. In agricultural sector, advanced robot and drone are helping farmer to reduce labour depend work. Robots are also used in restaurant, hotel and bank where they are working seamlessly to support customer need.
I feel though robot bring many benefit like improvement in productivity, reduction in human error..there could be pitfalls as well. They could lead to job loss in sectors where it is labour intensive. This could lead to income inequality.
Hence i believe we should balance using robots with human employment so that we can reap the benefit of the automation with very little problem.

Each language has its  own rules, structure. If you are  a foreigner it is not  easy to adopt the grammar unless your main language is similar.
During learning a new language, grammar is one of the main difficulty. In order to emphasize the meanings, feelings, emotions, information  properly , a correct sequence of sentence is needed. Subject, verb, object is the main sequence for most of the languages.
No doubt that It's taken new language learners a while to  get used to the vocabulary and the pronunciation as well . 
Sometimes, similar sounds cause misunderstanding of the real meaning of what is being emphasized.
Listening music in a new language , watching TV series with subtitles, attending to the group or private speaking  courses are the strategies of learning and improving a new language.

I think your shop has many things to be arranged. For example, the shop has a poor lighting, there are no air conditioning, the fire extinguishers are old and may not work when needed because of low pressure. Not least, those chemicals you have can be a fire hazard. Therefore, I suggest you to replace the lighting and extintors, install ventilation and throw away the unnecessary chemicals.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: As there were a few problems with Cessna 123's landing, you have been asked to write a report by your superiors. Write the report below. Write 100 - 150 words. Response: Report: Cessna 123 Landing Incident
Date: September 19
To: André Risson
From: Eurípedes Garcia Batista
Subject: Cessna 123 Landing Incident

During the recent landing of Cessna 123 at Aeroporto Santa Genoveva in the city of  Goiânia  there were several issues that require attention and analysis. This report outlines the observed problems and provides recommendations for improvement.
As it follows, the main observations are concerning  the approaching angle of the  Cessna 123 as it  approached the runway at a steeper angle than recommended, resulting in a hard touchdown. 
As to the  flare timing, the pilot initiated the flare too late, causing the aircraft to touch down abruptly and finally, as far as the crosswind handling is concerned, Cessna 123 struggled to maintain alignment with the runway during crosswind conditions.
Some Recommendations:
As to timing, we suggest that the pilot should undergo additional training on proper approach and flare techniques.
Concerning crosswind training we suggest that the specific crosswind landing training is essential to improve handling during adverse conditions. 
In respect to the review SOPs, we suggest that it is ensured adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs) for safe landings.

In conclusion, addressing these issues will enhance safety and prevent similar incidents in the future.  Regular training and adherence to procedures are critical for all pilots.
  
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Eurípedes Garcia Batista
Airport manager

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: The fuselage is the body of the aircraft. The landing gear can be retracted into the undercarriage of the fuselage after take-off and must be in a GEAR DOWN position before landing. All passenger seats are located in the fuselage, as well as the cockpit and cargo storage locations. Attached to the fuselage are the wings. Due to the curved shape of the upper part of the wing it creates lift, but - by increasing the angle of attack and thus increasing lift - also more drag. For take-off and landing the pilot should use the flaps to decrease the stall speed. At the end of each wing you can find the ailerons. These parts are controlled by moving the stick in the cockpit left and right, causing the airplane to roll into the desired direction. Simultaneously using the rudder to support the directional change is key to a nice and clean turn. The rudder is part of the vertical stabilizer at the tail of the aircraft and controls the rate of turn. Another part of the tail is the horizontal stabilizer. This system is used to change the angle of attack and therefore the rate of climb and the altitude of the aircraft. Last but not least it depends on the type of aircraft which engine type is used. Generally, today there are two common types of engines used in aviation: Single engine piston engines, which commonly run on aviation gas (AVGAS), or turbines, which use jet-fuel or kerosene.

Here are some ideas for you, and I have prioritized them.

1. I recommend cutting everyone back to 36hrs a week. It may save around $300 per person and $15,000 for the whole company monthly. 

2. For business traveling, we should reduce the expenses that are not needed or consider economic alternatives such as driving their own car instead of renting.

3. I strongly recommend that a 5% layoff of employees will be only as a last resort.

Hope these proposals will help us catch up on the budget.

Recommending a training company for our staff is the aim of this report. In total we compared two different training companies: TrainQuick and Skills Pro.

This is one of its principal advantages of Skills Pro - they plan to expand their course set and improve them continuously. Secondly, the course is difficult, but people who take the course regularly, will finish it successfully. The only major drawback of Skills Pro is its high cost.

"Prompt Level: 5.0 Prompt: Write about a movie you recently saw. Give facts and opinions about it. Who starred in the movie? Who directed it? What was it about? Type in the input box. Write 60-100 words. Use your own words where possible. Response: Yesterday I saw the film ""The little things"". A thriller directed by Hancock. Denzel Washington and Rami Malek are the main actors. The plot is about 6 unsolved murders. The film’s soundtrack was composed by Thomas Newman. Set in the early 1990s in Los Angeles, the film is about two detectives investigating a series of murders, which lead them to a lonely stranger who may be the killer. The style of the film is called ""Neo-noir"" and is a style of cinema that uses much of the elements of film noir, but which deals with topics with current content, and in which aesthetically elements that were absent in film noir films of the 1940s and 1950s are observed.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a paragraph describing how robots are being used in your country. How do you feel about them? In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: “He replaced 10 men on the hose, so he does a very heavy job. When there is a forest fire, it is very exhausting and exposes the firefighters. It contributes a lot to this”, explained Fernanda Morelli, executive director of Ambipar Robotics.

The robot has an operating autonomy of 10 hours, withstands temperatures of up to 600°C for 15 minutes and also has a displacement mechanism that does not use rubber, but a bronze and aluminum mat that does not produce sparks on the floor.

This allows access to locations with fuel leaks without putting anyone at risk.
As it is operated by remote control from up to 300 meters away and with signal return via Wi-Fi, STW Response can be monitored by a control center. It has seven cameras located on the front, back and sides, as well as a thermal and a night camera.

During the biggest event in the oil and gas sector in Latin America, held from September 23 to 26 in Rio de Janeiro, STW Response was one of the attractions at the Ambipar stand. According to Morelli, he is ready to take action in the country.

“Ambipar is a specialist in risk management. So, she responds to a lot of emergencies. Today, the brigade members are wearing mufflers. They don’t have much technology and this equipment is an innovation.”

   Hope you are doing well. I’m writing to you to show you how my speech for the weekly meeting is going to be. Please, let me know if there’s anything else needed to add.
   First of all, in the opening I’m going to talk about achievements. The main one is the renewed partnership with Crum as we were expecting this news for the past months and also, to celebrate with the team. In addition, Crum praised our dedication to quality so I’m going to let the team know. I’m sure it will give us a lot of motivation.
   In the body, I’ll explain the problems and of course the solution. The first problem is about unresolved defects that we came across three months ago. Next, the minor problems such as tech issues. Finally, the solution that considers the changed update delivery and the improved Quality Assurance processes.
   In conclusion, I’m going to walk through the future. The main point is the further support to avoid problems with customers.

Hope this email finds you well.
With regards to the discussion we had regarding the priority projects, please find the attached list of projects that are necessary and unnecessary.
* Priority Projects:
US Client Design
The US client will work with us if we design the workforce well and give our best effort to perform well. This project is very good in terms of profitability. Although the progress of the project is very slow but this will pick up shortly.
New Hires:
We are spending huge on advertising for new recruitment however this is very important as two former employees leaving us in Q2. We will be needing very good resources in replacement so as to run the projects smoothly.
Less Priority:
Marketing Media Reorganisation:
We are spending a lot on marketing media. I agree that use of marketing media is important but since the one we are using is outdated and requires a lot of effort to organise, my belief is to stop that and to think of a better alternative.
Thanking You,

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Summarize the report, using your own words. Write 8-10 lines. Compare your text with the model. Response:  On June 13, 2010, InterStar Airways Flight 293 landed safely in San Francisco with its nose wheels turned sideways.
The plane originally took off from Oakland to Phoenix with 141 passengers and no problems at first.
The crew saw error messages about the nose landing gear and steering.
They flew by the control tower in San Jose, which confirmed the nose wheels were facing the wrong way.
The captain chose San Francisco for landing due to its better emergency support and longer runway.
To make the landing safer, the crew flew around to burn fuel and reduce weight.
Passengers were told about the gear issue and evacuation plans in case of an emergency.
The captain landed the plane carefully, avoiding reverse thrust and using normal brakes.
Tires tore apart during landing, but the plane stayed straight on the runway.
No one was hurt, and passengers exited safely the aircraft using an air stair.  Correction: <input><code a=""PHRA"" c=""""> </code>On June 13, 2010, InterStar Airways Flight 293 landed safely in San Francisco with its nose wheels turned sideways.<code a=""PHRA"" c="" "">

Response: I can't believe that we've only seen each other once in the last 20 years! A lot has happened in my life since then.

About five years ago, Stella and I moved with our son Jeremy to Oxford, New Zealand, and lived out in the country. I did contract design work. You know that's what I've always loved. Stella taught math in a local university. Jeremy went to school and made a lot of friends. Eventually, though, we ended up back in St. Louis, where we've been living for the past year.

I'm working for a design firm, and Stella has been teaching in a university. We bought a little two-bedroom house in the suburbs, and we're basically happy, but sometimes we feel that something's missing. The suburbs are crowded, and the houses all look the same. Jeremy left for college, so we're lonely, old empty nesters looking for a change. We're actually thinking about adopting a child. At our age, are we crazy?

it gives us great pleasure to announce that we are changing our company logo. 

Our market research has shown that our old logo is very unfashioned and old school. As a result, we have decided that it's time to replace the old logo with a modern designed logo. In addition, by changing our logo, we can improve our reputation as a leader in the field. 

We hope and believe that this change will convince you just as much. However, please feel free to give us any opinion about the change.

We look forward to welcoming you at our event on July 24th and introducing you to our new logo. Please confirm your participation by July 10th.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Many people find it difficult to start a writing project. They may have difficulty thinking about what to write, so they procrastinate. But everything usually generates more stress and anxiety as the deadline approaches, which in turn can make it even more difficult to start a paper.

There are different techniques, but in my opinion, listening and freewriting are the most effective when you need to tell a story. Listening, talking to other people about your topic and listening to their comments; you will probably learn a new perspective on your topic that you hadn't imagined. 
If you are making an argument, share it with others; what objections do they raise? If you are researching a social issue, interview others and ask their opinion about it. Freewriting, to overcome anxiety or blockage, force yourself to write about the topic for five to ten minutes without stopping. 
If you get stuck and don't know what to say, simply write “I don't know what to say...”. Keep writing and don't stop until the time is up. Remember that freewriting is for your eyes only, so there is no pressure to “get it right.” After five or ten minutes, stop writing. Read what you have written.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a criticism of a celebrity. It can be a particular celebrity or the whole idea of celebrity in general. Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Society is increasingly rewarding overhyped representations of celebrities on a global scale, thereby creating a group of bad role models to younger generations of people who look up to such figures for inspiration. Their lack of authenticity or real value is a cause of concern for societies because it is unclear why prominent personalities today are deemed celebrities when they have not had a meaningful impact on society. One of the most toxic effects of the current celebrity culture is the glorification of people who are doing immoral, illegal or unethical things. The reality for many consumers of the celebrity culture is that the content they buy is primarily driven by popularity as opposed to quality. People cannot distinguish good and bad celebrity behaviours. In today’s highly energised media environment, such populations may experience difficulties learning right and wrong behaviours.
