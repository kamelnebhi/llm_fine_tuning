"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: You’re writing a brief performance review of your sales team member Oliver. Type in the input box. Write 100-150 words. Response: Oliver Murray has been with our sales team for just one year, but he has already made a significant impact. He had a very strong start, quickly demonstrating intelligence, creativity, and a strong work ethic. His ability to generate innovative ideas and avoid mistakes is impressive. One of Oliver’s major contributions was identifying and fixing a product error that saved the company a substantial amount of money. He was named employee of the month twice and received a well-deserved promotion after just six months.

However, there are areas for improvement. Oliver recently missed two important deadlines and failed to communicate with the team, which affected project coordination. While he is exceptionally clever and driven, he would benefit from focusing more on team dynamics and improving communication.

Going forward, Oliver’s goals should include better time management and becoming more of a team player. With these improvements, I’m confident he will continue to grow into a highly effective and well-rounded team member.","<input>Oliver Murray has been with our sales team for just one year, but he has already made a significant impact.

NAFTA has had a significant impact on the economies of its member countries. The agreement has increased trade volumes, economic growth, and investment opportunities. For example, trade between the US and Mexico has grown from $81 billion in 1993 to over $600 billion today.

Key provisions of NAFTA include:

- Tariff reduction and elimination
- Simplified customs procedures
- Protection of intellectual property rights
- Dispute resolution mechanisms

While NAFTA has faced criticism and challenges, it remains an important trade agreement for North America. Its impact on regional economic integration and cooperation has been substantial, and it continues to shape trade policies and practices in the region.

In 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which builds upon the foundation established by NAFTA and addresses new trade issues, such as digital trade and labor rights.

After a flyby at San Jose, we confirmed the nose wheels were stuck 90° left. We diverted to SFO for its longer runway and better emergency support. Landed without reverse thrust—tires blew out and shredded, but we stayed on centerline. No fire, just burnt rubber. Everyone deplaned safely. Wild day, but solid teamwork<code a=""PUNCT"" c=""!"">.</code>

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Now write a report comparing the two car designs. Which design do you think you should go with? Persuade your design team to choose one of the designs for next year’s rollout. Write 100-150 words. Response: In today’s fast-paced automotive market, making the right car buying decision can be like navigating a complex maze. With numerous brands, models, specifications, options, colors, packages, and prices to consider, potential car buyers often find themselves overwhelmed by choices.

JATO’s recent survey of 2,500 future car buyers revealed that 29% of people would research online first when buying a new car. This is where car comparison tools can prove to be essential for securing new and repeat business on automotive websites.
1) Streamlining decision-making process
Imagine a customer is in the market for a hatchback and they’re looking at your brand. There are many things for them to consider – from price points to specification requirements – so having the right information is crucial to support the sales journey.

 

Using a car comparison tool, they can effortlessly access the facts they need, compare your model offering against direct competitors and evaluate specifications side by side. From engine performance and fuel efficiency to safety features and advanced technology, they will have a comprehensive overview that highlights key advantages and differences.

 

This information gives customers clarity and helps to simplify the decision-making process.
 Enhancing transparency and trust
Transparency is a cornerstone of modern business practices. By offering a car comparison tool, your brand can demonstrate its commitment to providing potential buyers with an honest and unbiased evaluation of their offerings. This fosters trust and reinforces the brand’s credibility – both crucial factors in building lasting customer relationships, recommendations, and repeat business.

 

3) Customisation tailored to individual preferences
Car comparison tools go beyond listing features. They allow potential buyers to explore the various options, colours, and packages available for each model. This means that a buyer can seamlessly experiment with different specifications according to their preferences, budget, and what is available in the market today.

 

According to JATO’s recent research, the top options people like to add if they have remaining budget are safety features (parking sensors, lane assist etc.). Therefore, a car comparison tool that allows customers to compare safety options from multiple brands – from price to capability – can enhance the customer experience.

 

Offering high levels of customisation and direct access to information gives the car buyer more power, ensuring that the final purchase aligns with their preferences and requirements.

 

4) Offering a digital first experience
The car buying journey has previously involved extensive research, various dealership visits, and test drives. Today, car comparison tools enable brands and customers to streamline the initial research phase, saving valuable time and energy. Customers browsing your website can now conveniently access all the information they need in one place, making the process more efficient and increasing customer satisfaction.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: The question of whether companies have a responsibility to society or if their primary obligation lies solely with shareholders is a complex and highly debated issue. I firmly believe that companies do have a responsibility to society, and this perspective aligns with the growing movement toward corporate social responsibility (CSR). First of all, companies are integral parts of the communities in which they operate. They benefit from the resources, infrastructure, and workforce that these communities provide. Businesses thrive in environments that are stable, sustainable, and supportive. Therefore, it is not only ethical but also pragmatic for companies to engage in practices that uplift their communities. This two-way relationship fosters goodwill and can enhance company's reputation, leading to increased customer loyalty and, ultimately, better financial performance.
Furthermore, the modern consumer is increasingly aware and concerned about social and environmental issues. As noted by Jack@MSU, a strong CSR record can significantly influence consumer choices. Companies that demonstrate a commitment to ethical practices and social responsibility often enjoy enhanced brand loyalty and, consequently, improved sales. This suggests that doing good and doing well are not mutually exclusive but can go hand-in-hand.
On the other hand, the arguments against CSR, such as those presented by Milton Friedman and others, emphasize a more traditional view that prioritizes shareholder profit above all else. While it is essential for businesses to be profitable, this narrow focus can lead to short-term thinking and potentially harmful practices that disregard the broader implications of their operations on society and the environment. Moreover, the argument that it is the government's 
role to enforce social responsibility fails to acknowledge that businesses have a unique opportunity to drive positive change. Many societal issues can be more effectively addressed by innovative corporate strategies rather than relying solely on regulatory frameworks. Companies have the resources and influence to implement impactful initiatives that address social challenges directly, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future. In conclusion, I believe that companies not only have a responsibility to their shareholders but also to the societies in which they operate. By embracing CSR, businesses can build stronger relationships with their communities, enhance their brand reputation, and ultimately drive sustainable success.

The aircraft made a hard landing, resulting in a bounce and a brief veer to the left before the pilot regained full control. No injuries were reported, and the aircraft taxied safely to the gate.

Preliminary checks suggest possible minor issues with the nose gear shock absorption system. Weather conditions were within operational limits, but the gusts were stronger than forecasted. The flight crew followed standard procedures and responded promptly to the situation.

The aircraft has been temporarily grounded for a full inspection. Further investigation is underway to determine whether any mechanical or procedural factors contributed to the incident.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Summarize the report, using your own words. Write 8-10 lines. Compare your text with the model. Response: **Flight 293 Incident Summary Report**

On June 13, 2010, InterStar Airways Flight 293, a scheduled domestic passenger service, was forced to execute an emergency landing at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) due to a critical mechanical failure involving the aircraft’s nose landing gear. The Airbus, carrying 141 passengers and six crew members, initially departed Oakland, California at 15:31, bound for Phoenix, Arizona. However, shortly after takeoff, the flight crew received a fault warning regarding the nose landing gear shock absorber and nose wheel steering system.

While the aircraft’s climb appeared normal at first, the cockpit's control panel displayed concerning error messages. In response, the captain diverted the flight to San Jose, California, where air traffic controllers, airline ground personnel, and a nearby news helicopter visually confirmed that the nose wheels were locked 90 degrees to the left — a potentially hazardous configuration for landing.

Recognizing the severity of the situation, the captain made the strategic decision to divert again, this time to SFO, which offered superior runway length, optimal surface conditions, and enhanced emergency services. To minimize risk upon landing, the crew flew in holding patterns for several hours to reduce fuel weight.

In preparation for a potentially dangerous touchdown, the captain informed the cabin crew of the gear malfunction and advised that passengers would evacuate through the rear exits in case of a nose gear collapse. The crew maintained clear communication with the passengers, calmly preparing them for emergency procedures without causing panic.

During final approach, the captain skillfully controlled the descent, touching down at approximately 120 knots. He delayed nose gear contact for as long as possible, applying normal braking at 90 knots. The engines were shut down at 60 knots to prevent complications. The flight crew deliberately avoided using reverse thrust or automatic braking systems to maintain greater manual control. Upon ground contact, the nose tires rapidly deteriorated, shredding and exposing the axle, though the aircraft’s trajectory remained stable throughout.

Though the forward cabin crew reported the smell of burning rubber during deceleration, the control tower quickly confirmed that there was no fire on board. Following this reassurance, the aircraft came to a safe stop, and passengers disembarked calmly via an air stair, without injuries or further incident.

Despite the severe nose gear malfunction, the flight crew’s professionalism, precision, and calm under pressure ensured the safety of all on board.

On June 13, 2010, InterStar Airways Flight 293<code a=""PHRA"" c="" "">, a scheduled domestic passenger service, </code>was forced to <code a=""VERB"" c=""make"">execute</code> an emergency landing at San Francisco International Airport <code a=""PHRA"" c="""">(SFO) </code>due to a critical mechanical failure <code a=""PHRA"" c=""with"">involving</code> the aircraft’s nose landing gear. The Airbus, carrying 141 passengers and six crew members, <code a=""ADV"" c="""">initially </code>departed Oakland, California <code a=""PHRA"" c="""">at 15:31, </code>bound for Phoenix, Arizona. <code a=""PHRA"" c=""Shortly"">However, shortly</code> after takeoff, <code a=""PHRA"" c="""">the flight crew received </code>a fault warning <code a=""PHRA"" c="""">regarding the nose landing gear shock absorber and nose wheel steering system.

In preparation for a potentially dangerous touchdown, the captain informed the cabin crew of the gear malfunction and advised that passengers would evacuate through the rear exits in case of a nose gear collapse.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Move over, werewolves and vampires. There’s a big, richly imaginative and extremely spooky world of desi ghosts, monsters and mythical creatures just waiting to devour…er to be discovered and given their rightful place in popular culture. Some of them can be found crawling through the pages of ancient texts, some adorn temple walls, while the stories of others are told through whispers and hushed songs, their forms changing and twisting with each narration. There are thousands of mythical creatures of Indian origin, but in the interest of space, attention span and potential Halloween costumes, we’ve prepared a list of seven fantastic creatures and where to find them (but hopefully you won’t go looking for them).

Tekhumiavi
The tale of the tekhumiavi or the were-tiger is popular among the Angami tribe of Nagaland. Unlike werewolves, were-tigers don’t transform from human to animal completely. Instead, only the soul of the human shifts to a tiger’s body, while the human body functions normally, albeit soulless for the time being. While in this form, the human behaves just like a tiger, and the human body experiences everything the tiger body does – somewhat like what happens in the Matrix. 

Now, how does one tell a tekhumiavi from a regular tiger? Simple – the were-tiger has five claws instead of four, so you can tell from the pugmarks. So, here’s something to look out for when you’re exploring the hills of Nagaland. 

Tekhumiavi
Penchapenchi
This monster out of Bengali folklore looks like an owl – yes, the dispenser of wisdom in animal stories – but it doesn’t exactly behave like one. A penchapenchi preys on forest dwellers, especially the ones who are foolish to wander off alone. Once the penchapenchi is sure that help is far away, it strikes down its prey and then drains their blood. Whether the victim turns into a penchapenchi (like in the case of a vampire bite) or not is yet to be confirmed.

Penchapenchi
Navagunjara
A mash-up of nine different animals, the navagunjara makes a special appearance in an Odia retelling of the Mahabharata as a manifestation of Vishnu. Story goes that when Arjuna, one of the Pandava princes, was in the middle of a penance, a strange creature appeared before him. Arjuna’s instinctive reaction, because he was terrified, was of course to point an arrow at it. The creature had the neck and head of a peacock, the hump of a bull, the waist of a lion, and the tail of a snake, and it stood on three different kinds of feet – an elephant’s, a horse or a deer’s and a tiger’s. Its fourth limb was human, which held a lotus. Before he let the arrow fly, Arjuna saw the lotus and realised what the creature truly represented.

Naale Ba
An urban legend, mostly based in Karnataka, demands that the words Naale ba or ‘come tomorrow’ be painted outside houses (with no spelling mistakes, mind) to ward off a witch, who likes knocking on doors at night and murdering whoever’s unlucky enough to open them. Thankfully, the witch’s kryptonite seems to be her own politeness.

Monsters really do have a thing for lone travellers, don’t they? The nishi, found mostly in the forests of Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand, are particularly vicious because they call out to their potential victims in the voice of their loved ones. Once the victims are lured into a well and truly secluded place, the nishi proceeds to kill them. Because they always appear in the distance, the only description we have of them is that they are shadowy creatures. Fortunately,  there is a way to identify these crafty creatures. If you hear the call thrice, you can rest assured that it’s not a nishi, because the ghost can, well, only be bothered to call out twice. The next time a loved one fondly calls out to you twice, there is no need to respond; flee.

Nishi
Gandeberunda
You probably already know the story of Narasimha, Vishnu’s hybrid avatar. Evil demon Hiranyakashipu gets a boon from Brahma that makes him practically invincible, which in turn gives him the licence to terrorize everyone. But when he tries to murder his own son, Vishnu decides that enough is enough and vanquishes Hiranyakashipu in the most creative way (you see, all boons come with loopholes) in his Narasimha avatar.

The story doesn’t end there though. Even with Hiranyakashipu out of the picture, Narasimha is still really, really angry, and afraid that his anger issues would destroy the world, the gods beseech Shiva to do something. Of course, the only way to tackle a powerful mythical creature is to turn into a powerful mythical creature yourself. Shiva becomes Sharabha – a half-lion (to match Narasimha, understandably) and half-bird form (the OG Angry Bird) – and manages to subdue Narasimha. The story is still not over, because Narasimha becomes Angrier Bird – taking on the form of Gandeberunda, a gigantic two-headed bird with Hulk-like strength. Sharabha, thankfully, calls it quits after 18 days of fighting and Gandeberunda also finally calms down. This powerful bird happens to be the state emblem of Karnataka, and the Gandeberunda motif can be found in many places in India, including temple architecture.

Bhoota Vahana Yantra
It appears that robots are quite ancient. According to an 11th-century text, when Buddha died, it fell to King Ajatashatru of Magadha to protect his sacred relics. Ajatashatru concealed the relics in a secret underground chamber in his capital, Pataliputra (now Patna in Bihar). And the warriors who stood guard were automatons, but not just any automatons though. Bhoota Vahana Yantra literally means ‘spirit movement machine’, so these robots had spirits inside them that were responsible for their movements. Needless to say, these robots made excellent guards.

Ajatashatru concealed the relics in a secret underground chamber in his capital, Pataliputra (now Patna in Bihar). And the warriors who stood guard were automatons, but not just any automatons though. Bhoota Vahana Yantra literally means ‘spirit movement machine’, so these robots had spirits inside them that were responsible for their movements. Needless to say, these robots made excellent guards</code>.<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code><code a=""PHRA"" c="""">

Ladies and gentlemen,

Imagine our company as a ship sailing through unpredictable waters. Each department is a vital crew — the engineers in the engine room, the strategists at the helm, the communicators in the crow’s nest. Together, we steer this vessel toward new horizons.

Of course, storms arise. Some challenges are rough waves that rock us slightly — delays, tight deadlines, or shifting markets. Others are hidden reefs — unexpected costs or internal miscommunication. But with every obstacle, we learn to navigate better.

Our crews — from IT squads to marketing units — have proven their resilience. You've tightened the sails, adjusted the course, and kept us afloat even in turbulent times.

As captain of this journey, I don’t take credit alone. It’s your commitment, your insight, your teamwork that has made the difference.

Let’s continue to read the map together, anticipate the storms, and celebrate each safe harbor we reach.

The ocean ahead is vast, but our compass is strong. And with this crew, I have no doubt — we will reach remarkable destinations.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Among the introduced techniques, free writing and loop writing appear most useful. Free writing allows for a spontaneous and unfettered exploration of ideas, overcoming writer's block and fostering creativity. Loop writing builds upon this by providing a structured framework to refine and develop those initial ideas into coherent narratives. This combination of spontaneity and structure makes it a powerful tool for brainstorming and developing a piece of writing. 
Listing and questioning are also valuable, as they provide a means to organize thoughts and explore different facets of a topic. Listing helps in creating a comprehensive overview, while questioning encourages deeper reflection and analysis. These techniques are particularly helpful for organizing thoughts before drafting a piece and for ensuring that all relevant aspects of a topic are considered.

many different approaches of teaching these organizational and critical skills with freewriting. Peter Elbow and Lynn Hammond both use freewriting in their classes in similar manners. Elbow went through three bouts of teaching before settling on the style he uses today. The first bout occurred during his graduate year at M.I.T. where he ""simply tried to imitate the good teachers (he had) had—to be Socrates and a good guy at the same time"" (Embracing Contraries 67). After teaching in this manner for five years, he went through a ""why should I tell them anything if they don't ask me questions"" stage, in which he taught his classes (sophomore level) based on a three step system. First the students had to state on paper three times during the year what the expected to learn or what they had learned. Each student pursued his/her own goals with only constraints of reality to steer their learning. Second, all students read either a work of literature, or something about literature each week, and third, they all had to write something on paper and put it in a box where all the other students could read it and make comments (Contraries 71).

Hope you are doing well. 

This email is regarding the policy changes which happened last week. I am looking forward for this new policy of coming up with the free breakfast to all employees in the company.  This is a great initiative taken up by the company. Now most of the employees don't have to worry about preparing breakfast in the morning. The mornings are sorted for all our employees. The breakfast menu is very healthy which will avoid our employees to eat anything junk. This will be a good start of the day. This will also help employees to reach office on time as the breakfast time will be only till 10 am.  

I hope everyone is as excited as I am, and I am hoping  that, with your help and creativity, this new policy will be a big success to our company.

Thank you for your help.

I have completed my investigation into your staff’s lack of compliance with the code of conduct. Here are my findings:

Male employees regularly smoke in the toilet.

Many female employees do not abide by the dress code (jeans, short skirts, etc.).

Certain employees are often late for work.

Workspaces are not clean and tidy; in fact, they are messy.

Confidential documents are often taken out of the office.

It seems obvious to me a new code of conduct is needed, and I think you should write it ASAP. Something needs to be done!

New York City, often referred to as ""The Big Apple,"" is a bustling metropolis known for its vibrant culture and towering skyscrapers. The city thrives on its fast-paced lifestyle, with people constantly on the move. The energy in NYC is palpable, whether you're walking through Times Square or riding the subway. It’s a melting pot of cultures, and this diversity is reflected in its food, neighborhoods, and festivals. The iconic skyline, featuring landmarks like the Empire State Building, gives the city a unique, unmistakable character.

On the other hand, Tokyo, Japan, offers a very different but equally fascinating experience. The city blends modern technology with traditional customs, making it a unique fusion of old and new. While the streets of Tokyo are just as busy as New York’s, there’s a sense of calm in the midst of all the hustle. Tokyo’s meticulous organization is evident in its efficient public transport system and the careful balance of green spaces amid urban sprawl. Unlike NYC’s chaotic energy, Tokyo's vibe is more orderly yet still vibrant, offering a serene escape in its parks and temples.

Both cities offer remarkable experiences, but while New York pulses with raw energy and diversity, Tokyo provides a harmonious blend of tradition and modernity.

And now, as we look to the future, we’re more committed than ever to innovation, partnership, and delivering real value to our clients. To wrap up, my key mission in BonVoyager is to increase the experience of our customers by creating a spetecular travel and that is how the profits come.","<input>Good morning everyone,

Hello,

As you know, I need your help preparing a short presentation about the company for new recruits. Can you write up a short speech? Try to make it engaging; I don't want just a boring list of facts. Some key points to include:

• Frisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko.

• locations in 20 cities all over the world

• more than 5,000 employees

• our profit of 5 million dollars last year and 10 percent of the global market

• New employees are expected to be motivated and enthusiastic.

It might be useful to hold a quiz to see how much they already know about the company.

They might want to know something about me, so you can tell them about the time I fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. If you remember that story, you know that the passing ship that saved my life inspired me to start my own shipping company. Hopefully they'll see that as evidence that they can find inspiration anywhere.

And make sure to conclude the presentation by getting them to think and act. Please send me a draft of the speech by the end of tomorrow. Thanks!

Best regards,

Bill","<input>From<code a=""DET"" c="""">_</code>

Today, I want to highlight our achievement, especially on renewed partnership with Crum. Our recipe for this success is our teamwork. Our client praised our dedication to quality. We must continue our great work and provide quality first.
So, with this in mind, I couldn't talk about the major problem we saw 3 months ago. Effectively, the unresolved defects affecting our shoppers. Briefly, I have to mention the other tech issues that we have also met. I've told you about the issues and now it's time to talk about solution. Here again, the best way we found to solve these problems was the creation and the collaboration of multi-team. That allowed us to make all the necessary fixes. The management of our delivery and the improvement of our process about the Quality Assurance was our best ingredient to achieve our contract with our client.
In closing, we will give more support in order to make sure we avoid further problems with other customers. Before you go, we could take a moment for a Q&A session if some of you have a question.
Thank you and have a nice day.

As requested, here are the ideas for cutting costs:

1 - Offer workers a retirement bonus.
2 - Reduce everyone's working hours to 35 hours a week.
3 - Lay off for a select workers.
4 - Primarize some activities by reallocating labor

Our studies indicate that if we adopt such proposals the company will become profitable in the next 2 years. However, some of them can harm the working environment in the company.

Best regards.

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: You're going to write about an interesting, fictional event that happened to a friend. Write your blog post. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Last year during the winter holyday a friend of mine Federico travelled with a group of friend to Marrakesh, Morocco. It was a short stay, just a couple of days, a different gateaway than the classic mountain trip.

They decided to stay in a Riad, a typical moroccan house inside the Medina old city centre. The location was perfetct, just  a cuple of streets away from the the famous Jemaa el-Fnaa square.

The first day they explored the maze-like alleys of the Medina, and wandered the souks in search of little treasure to bring home. Spices, silk, ceramics and all kind of trinkets filled the stands to the brim.
Still the best part of the holiday remained the one day trip to the desert.

They departed early in the morning, the city was calm and silent still asleep in the early hours, such a contrast to the buzzing  and bustling evenings!
Halfaway the car ride they had a stop to a local Argan shop; it was a only female traditional company. They watched them make all argan byproducts, oil but also marmalade, butter an honey. I'd never imagined there were so much different things made of it!

After enjoyung a nice mint tea an some typical pastry they boarded the bus to reach their true destination. Near a rural village the cap was set; after setting their stuff they prepared for the camel ride in the desert. Imangine: a whole grop of 10 adults wobbling an shuffling prcauriosly on top of their mighty steeds, it must have been hilarious!
The dinner was served at the sunset all typical food, chicken and lamb tajines, cous cous, soups and bread and at the end the mandatory mint tea obviously! They watched a beatiful show of mroccan songs and dancing and even a fire show just before retiring for the night.

Last but not least they wake up around 1 a.m. to watch the night sky; without the light pollution and in the endless plains of the desert surrounding them the number of stars was countless!

As their trip came to an end, they promised to return to Morocco to visit all the other missing city from Casablanca to Rabat. For the time being they wait for their next adventure, Istanbul here they come!

The idea for Zen, our planned $4million “boutique” hotel, which will encapsulate a spa and health and fitness center came from recent market research by the AccomData Group. While there has been a growing trend in weekend getaway to relaxing resorts as well as greater attention to a healthy lifestyle, surveys show that most fitness centers offer an unsatisfying cuisine. This is why on addition to fully equipped gyms and swimming pools with trained instructors, Zen will also offer a healthy menu elaborated by elite chefs from the world’s most renowned restaurants. 
With the construction time estimated to take just two years, we foresee a return on investment by the second year after opening and a projected yearly profit of $1 million after that, which means that in just four years from opening the initial investment will be recouped and from then onwards we foresee only profits.
Risk Assessment
We have carried out a comprehensive risk assessment which has factored any potential economic downturn in the figures presented. Should the economy remain stable, the period required for recouping investment and realizing profits could be halved. To ensure the best possible initial outcome, we have planned an intensive media campaign being carried out by Kudos Advertising Agency.","<input>Strategic Summary<code a=""PHRA"" c=""

Hi,

What a crazy week it's been for me. As you know, my work has been one of my major stressors, especially with the new management. They don't seem to understand how to motivate their staff, and when we do a good job, they don't acknowledge us. I'm not sure how much longer I can work here.

Also, do you remember Tia, the girl I met in the coffee shop a few months ago? Well, things aren't going well between us, and I think we might end the relationship. That's got me feeling really down because I thought it was going well for a while.

Sorry for bothering you with this – I've got no one else to talk about this, and I just needed to vent. You always seem to be so calm and in control; maybe you have some advice for me on how I can deal with these problems?

Write 150-200 words. Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into force in January 1994, after years of negotiation, creating a trilateral trade bloc between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
 Its primary aim was to reduced or eliminated customs duties among the members such as tariffs, and foster economic integration among the three nations. The NAFTA has had a profound impact on trade relations, especially in agriculture; for example, Mexican fruits and vegetables flow into the US.Additionally, NAFTA encouraged foreign direct investment, enhancing the competitiveness of industries within the bloc.
NAFTA also faced criticism. Critics pointed to job losses in certain industries, particularly in manufacturing, due to companies relocating to Mexico for cheaper labor. Environmental concerns and the exploitation of workers were also points of contention.
In 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which updated key provisions to address modern trade challenges. NAFTA remains a significant milestone in North American economic history, exemplifying the potential and complexities of regional trade agreements.","<input>The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into force in January 1994, after years of negotiation, creating a trilateral trade bloc between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.<code a=""PHRA"" c="" "">

That is great news. I completely understand that we need to make sure the system is the right fit before we go any further.

I would like to enquire as to the possibility of collaborating on this project, or if you would consider our departments sharing the costs of development and maintenance if my team could use the system on a full-time basis.

I am very much looking forward to your response.

It is always hard to predict the future development, but experts seem to be optimistic that the index will continue rising. Main reasons for this are strong indicators such as massive investment from other countries, as well as Hong Kong’s internal demand.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: The landing gear should be retracted after liftoff when the airplane has reached an altitude where the airplane could no longer be landed on the runway if there is a power failure.
Landing gear is extended by placing the gear selector switch in the GEAR DOWN position.
The airspeed will decrease and the pitch attitude may increase.
During the several seconds it takes for the gear to extend, the pilot should be attentive to any abnormal sounds or feel.
The pilot should confirm that the landing gear has extended and locked by the normal sound and feel of the system operation as well as by the gear position indicators in the cockpit.
In most airplanes, the gear switch is shaped like a wheel in order to facilitate positive identification and to differentiate it from other cockpit controls.
A landing gear safety switch, sometimes referred to as asquat switch, is usually mounted in a bracket on one of the main gear shock struts.
The pilot should then turn on thebattery master switch and ensure that the landing gear position indicators show that the gear is down and locked.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: In France, robots are used in various sectors and improve the efficiency and safety of activities, their main uses are :
In industry to automate repetitive tasks to improve productivity, accuracy and working conditions. The negative aspect is that the low-skilled people who used these tasks before the use of robots no longer have a job and are difficult to reclassify.
In agriculture for cattle milking, cleaning and feeding, in wine production and market gardening, these autonomous robots reduce the use of chemical weed killers and preserve the soil.

For healthcare, robots can help surgeons with complex or remote procedures.
French companies are developing exoskeletons that allow paraplegics to regain mobility, or to help workers to carry heavy loads.

For security and emergency response, they allow access to dangerous areas without risk to firefighters, police or military.

Robotics in France is booming, in my opinion the only negative aspect being, as mentioned earlier, that it takes jobs away from low-skilled people who are difficult to reemploy.

Robots associated with AI will continue to advance in proportions that are difficult to imagine.

Here are some tips for motivating your team, I included some things to avoid too.

• Listen, be a good listener it’s important. People want to a leader who actively listen then, be about the problems or solutions.

• Be empathetic with your employees, put yourself in their shoes and try to understand the situation when they disagree with something.

• Incentivize and recognize your team. A reward always motivates people and they feel part of the company and most important, they feel that what they do it’s important for the company success.

And something’s to avoid demotivate your employees:

• Take credit for work done by you subordinates.
• Disrespect them because you are the boss.
• Lose your temper.
• Don’t recognize the people when they are doing a good work.
• Don’t be the example.

I hope that’s tips help you in this new journey, good luck with your team!
