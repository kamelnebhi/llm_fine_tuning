TrainQuick: This option is affordable and offers flexible scheduling, making it attractive in terms of cost and convenience. However, there are some challenges. For one, employees in our other branch haven’t been using it very much. Additionally, many employees prefer not to be mixed with individuals from other branches during training, as they feel it disrupts the team dynamic and can lead to less personalized instruction.

Skills Pro: While Skills Pro is more expensive, it offers a higher level of training quality. The course content is described as difficult, but those who complete the course often do so successfully, which speaks to the value of the training. Moreover, Skills Pro plans to expand its offerings, which could provide more comprehensive training options down the line.

After weighing the options, we’re likely to go with Skills Pro. Although it comes at a higher price point, the quality of the courses and the potential for greater long-term value make it the better choice.

After a thorough evaluation of potential training companies, we recommend Skills Pro for our employee development needs. Although Skills Pro commands a higher price point, its superior quality and effective outcomes justify this investment.

We assessed two contenders: TrainQuick and Skills Pro. TrainQuick, while economical and flexible, has not gained traction in our other branches. Feedback indicates that employees are uncomfortable when classes are mixed with participants from other locations, which detracts from the learning experience. Consequently, its utilization has been minimal, suggesting it may not meet our training objectives effectively.

In contrast, Skills Pro offers robust and comprehensive course content that, although challenging, has resulted in high completion rates among participants. The difficulty level ensures thorough mastery of skills, enhancing employee competencies significantly upon course completion. Furthermore, Skills Pro is poised for expansion, potentially offering even more tailored and diverse courses in the near future.

While the expense of Skills Pro exceeds that of TrainQuick, the investment in quality training is invaluable. Enhancing employee skills effectively will drive performance and contribute positively to our organizational goals. We recommend proceeding with Skills Pro as our designated training partner.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: nan","<input>An airplane is a complex machine with several key components, each serving a specific function to ensure safe and efficient flight. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane, housing the cockpit, passenger seats, and cargo. It provides structural integrity and aerodynamic shape, allowing the aircraft to slice through the air smoothly.

The wings are crucial for generating lift, enabling the airplane to rise off the ground. They are designed with airfoils that create a pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces, facilitating upward movement. Wings may also include control surfaces like ailerons and flaps to aid in maneuverability and stability during flight.

The tail, also known as the empennage, consists of the horizontal stabilizer and vertical stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer helps maintain balance and control pitch, while the vertical stabilizer provides directional stability and houses the rudder, which is used for steering the airplane left or right.

Finally, the engines are the powerhouse of the airplane, providing thrust to propel it forward. Modern airplanes typically use jet engines, which are efficient and powerful, allowing for high-speed travel over long distances. Together, these parts work in harmony to ensure an airplane can fly safely and effectively.</input>",65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e,7.0,0,0,0,True,0.586,"{'Score 0': 0.5859, 'Score 1': 0.3318, 'Score 2': 0.0704, 'Score 3': 0.0054, 'Score 4': 0.0031, 'Score 5': 0.0035}"

Kyoto, Japan, is my favorite city because of its serene beauty and deep cultural roots. Walking through Kyoto feels like stepping into a living museum. Ancient temples, peaceful gardens, and traditional tea houses create a calm, reflective atmosphere. The pace of life is slower, encouraging mindfulness and appreciation of small details—like the sound of bamboo rustling or the sight of cherry blossoms falling.

Then there’s New York City, a place that pulses with energy and ambition. Skyscrapers tower over bustling streets, and every corner offers something new—street performers, food trucks, or spontaneous conversations. Unlike Kyoto’s quiet charm, New York thrives on movement and diversity. It’s a city where people chase dreams and where cultures collide in vibrant harmony.

While Kyoto offers peace and tradition, New York offers excitement and innovation. Both cities are unforgettable, but in very different ways. One soothes the soul; the other sparks the imagination.","<input>Exploring the Charm of Kyoto, Then the Energy of New York City

He also drinks a lot of coffee while at work, which in turn keeps him awake at night. His diet is also unhealthy. According to him, he should lose at least 20 pounds.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Summarize the report, using your own words. Write 8-10 lines. Compare your text with the model. Response: **Flight 293 Incident Summary Report**

On June 13, 2010, InterStar Airways Flight 293, a scheduled domestic passenger service, was forced to execute an emergency landing at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) due to a critical mechanical failure involving the aircraft’s nose landing gear. The Airbus, carrying 141 passengers and six crew members, initially departed Oakland, California at 15:31, bound for Phoenix, Arizona. However, shortly after takeoff, the flight crew received a fault warning regarding the nose landing gear shock absorber and nose wheel steering system.

While the aircraft’s climb appeared normal at first, the cockpit's control panel displayed concerning error messages. In response, the captain diverted the flight to San Jose, California, where air traffic controllers, airline ground personnel, and a nearby news helicopter visually confirmed that the nose wheels were locked 90 degrees to the left — a potentially hazardous configuration for landing.

Recognizing the severity of the situation, the captain made the strategic decision to divert again, this time to SFO, which offered superior runway length, optimal surface conditions, and enhanced emergency services. To minimize risk upon landing, the crew flew in holding patterns for several hours to reduce fuel weight.

In preparation for a potentially dangerous touchdown, the captain informed the cabin crew of the gear malfunction and advised that passengers would evacuate through the rear exits in case of a nose gear collapse. The crew maintained clear communication with the passengers, calmly preparing them for emergency procedures without causing panic.

During final approach, the captain skillfully controlled the descent, touching down at approximately 120 knots. He delayed nose gear contact for as long as possible, applying normal braking at 90 knots. The engines were shut down at 60 knots to prevent complications. The flight crew deliberately avoided using reverse thrust or automatic braking systems to maintain greater manual control. Upon ground contact, the nose tires rapidly deteriorated, shredding and exposing the axle, though the aircraft’s trajectory remained stable throughout.

Though the forward cabin crew reported the smell of burning rubber during deceleration, the control tower quickly confirmed that there was no fire on board. Following this reassurance, the aircraft came to a safe stop, and passengers disembarked calmly via an air stair, without injuries or further incident.

Despite the severe nose gear malfunction, the flight crew’s professionalism, precision, and calm under pressure ensured the safety of all on board. The incident stands as a textbook example of decisive leadership, effective communication, and expert airmanship in the face of a mechanical emergency.","<input>**Flight 293 Incident Summary Report**

Hey [Bumba],

I just had the wildest experience at the grocery store today, and I couldn't wait to tell you about it! So, picture this: I'm in the produce aisle, minding my own business, when suddenly a squirrel comes darting across the floor. Yes, a squirrel! It was zig-zagging between the apples and bananas like it was on a mission.

As I stood there, bewildered, one of the store employees rushed over with a broom, trying to gently guide the little critter outside. But the squirrel was having none of it! It jumped onto the cart of an unsuspecting woman who let out a shriek that could have shattered glass. People were laughing and scrambling to get out of its path. It was like a scene straight out of a comedy movie.

Eventually, the squirrel found its way out the automatic doors, leaving behind a trail of amused and confused shoppers. I couldn't help but chuckle all the way home. Who knew grocery shopping could be so entertaining?

Hope you're having a less chaotic day!

Hi there,

This report aims to provide a preliminary assessment of the oil and gas resources in the newly opened Carlos Fields. The summary information in this report offers an initial overview of the different commodities present, although the amount and quality of data for each commodity vary.

Findings

Petroleum shows have been identified, but further testing is required on rocks of different ages. Surveys indicate that the field contains all the necessary elements for major oil and gas accumulations, including source rocks, reservoirs, and trapping mechanisms. However, the density of exploratory wells is sparse, which increases the exploration risk.

Conclusion

Based on the limited information available, we estimate the ultimate recovery from Carlos Fields to be approximately 21 million barrels of oil. With the application of tertiary recovery techniques and advancements in enhanced oil recovery, this estimate could potentially be exceeded.

Recommendations

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the oil, gas, and coal resources in the area, it is crucial to conduct a detailed geologic-engineering evaluation. This would involve acquiring new seismic data, compiling existing data, producing detailed structural contour maps for each potential reservoir, modeling the basic source rock parameters, and calculating petroleum volumetrics for each of the potential rock<code a=""PUNCT"" c="".""></code></input>",d01ca0b4-5249-49a4-8daf-ac2e0f274357,7.0,0,0,0,True,0.5913,"{'Score 0': 0.5913, 'Score 1': 0.3477, 'Score 2': 0.058, 'Score 3': 0.0018, 'Score 4': 0.0006, 'Score 5': 0.0005}"

Can you take a look at my proposal? I'm having problems with the executive summary. Can you help me write it?

Executive summary

I sugest them office one because is near restaurant

Advantages and disadvantages

An obvious advantage of Office One is that the rent is cheaper. Another big advantage is that there are a lot of restaurants nearby, as well as a bus and train station. A big con of Office Bravo is that it's too far from the city.

Conclusion

In conclusion, Office One is the best choice for a new office location for the company. It would be the most convenient, and it would keep staff happy. We suggest that we have a meeting next week to review this proposal. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Rio de Janeiro:

Approve: 35% (20% would buy)
Not approve: 65%
Shanghai:

Approve: 80% (40% would buy)
Not approve: 20%
Reasons for Disapproval (Rio: 65%, Shanghai: 20%):

Material
Moderate Satisfaction (20% in Rio, 40% in Shanghai):

Some satisfaction, but factors like poor execution and lack of market research led to only moderate interest.
Concerns: Insufficient market research before launch, lack of diversity in design.
Key Recommendations:

Conduct more research to understand men's needs in accessories.
Focus on design improvements (e.g., stitching color, better execution).
Ensure slim fitting sizes and use strong primary colors (black, white).
Choose wrinkle-free and sweat-absorbent materials.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: For me the best techniques for a creative writing are questioning and cubing.
Questioning technique is a five-step process which allows you to: recognize the richness and diversity of your subject (exploration); gather as much information as possible about this aspect (discovery); make some sense out of the body of information you’ve assembled (classification); determine what you want to say to the reader, and the order in which you want to say it (selecting and ordering).

Cubing technique is when before people write something important they often start with pre-writing to help them organize ideas, outline and clarify their thoughts and sort through what they really want to write.
A cube can help a person to think about their topic. It can be observed and described from six different angles and a few minutes can be spent writing about each of these. Any six prompts can be used on the cube. As an example, the six sides of a cube can be: describe, compare, associate, analyze, apply and argue.

Response: nan,"<input>The concept of celebrity often highlights the superficial aspects of fame, overshadowing genuine talent and hard work. Many celebrities are celebrated more for their social media presence and personal lives than for their actual contributions to their fields. This can create unrealistic standards and values, especially for young people who look up to them. The constant media attention and the pressure to maintain a certain image can lead to a lack of authenticity, with celebrities often presenting a curated version of their lives. Additionally, the immense wealth and privilege that come with celebrity status can create a disconnect from the everyday struggles of ordinary people. This disparity can foster a sense of entitlement and detachment, making it difficult for celebrities to relate to their fans. While there are certainly celebrities who use their platform for positive change, the overall culture of celebrity can sometimes promote vanity and materialism over substance and integrity.</input>",121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4,16.0,0,0,0,True,0.539,"{'Score 0': 0.5391, 'Score 1': 0.2849, 'Score 2': 0.0753, 'Score 3': 0.0213, 'Score 4': 0.0325, 'Score 5': 0.047}"

I recently watched The Banshees of Inisherin, and it<code a=""CONTR"" c=""’s"">'s</code> a film that’s quietly devastating yet strangely funny. Set on a remote Irish island in the 1920s, the story follows two lifelong friends, Pádraic and Colm, who suddenly fall out when Colm decides he no longer wants to speak to Pádraic. What unfolds is a dark, tragic unraveling of their friendship, filled with absurd moments and deep sadness.

Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are brilliant, with strong support from Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan.

The pace is slow at times, and the tone can be very bleak, but that’s also what makes it so powerful. I’d recommend this to anyone who enjoys character-driven films, dark humor, or Irish cinema. It’s one of those movies that lingers with you long after it ends.<code a=""PHRA"" c="""">

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to update you on our current priorities and ensure we are all aligned moving forward.

US Client Designs – High Priority! Our work with the US client is of utmost importance. While progress has been slow, it remains satisfactory.

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: You're going to write about an interesting, fictional event that happened to a friend. Write your blog post. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Last year during the winter holyday a friend of mine Federico travelled with a group of friend to Marrakesh, Morocco. It was a short stay, just a couple of days, a different gateaway than the classic mountain trip.

They decided to stay in a Riad, a typical moroccan house inside the Medina old city centre. The location was perfetct, just  a cuple of streets away from the the famous Jemaa el-Fnaa square.

The first day they explored the maze-like alleys of the Medina, and wandered the souks in search of little treasure to bring home. Spices, silk, ceramics and all kind of trinkets filled the stands to the brim.
Still the best part of the holiday remained the one day trip to the desert.

They departed early in the morning, the city was calm and silent still asleep in the early hours, such a contrast to the buzzing  and bustling evenings!
Halfaway the car ride they had a stop to a local Argan shop; it was a only female traditional company. They watched them make all argan byproducts, oil but also marmalade, butter an honey. I'd never imagined there were so much different things made of it!

After enjoyung a nice mint tea an some typical pastry they boarded the bus to reach their true destination. Near a rural village the cap was set; after setting their stuff they prepared for the camel ride in the desert. Imangine: a whole grop of 10 adults wobbling an shuffling prcauriosly on top of their mighty steeds, it must have been hilarious!
The dinner was served at the sunset all typical food, chicken and lamb tajines, cous cous, soups and bread and at the end the mandatory mint tea obviously! They watched a beatiful show of mroccan songs and dancing and even a fire show just before retiring for the night.

Last but not least they wake up around 1 a.m. to watch the night sky; without the light pollution and in the endless plains of the desert surrounding them the number of stars was countless!

As their trip came to an end, they promised to return to Morocco to visit all the other missing city from Casablanca to Rabat. For the time being they wait for their next adventure, Istanbul here they come!

Zen is a boutique hotel concept that combines luxury accommodation with a full-service spa and state-of-the-art health and fitness center. Backed by $4 million in funding, Zen aims to capitalize on the growing demand for weekend wellness retreats and health-focused travel, as identified in recent market research by the AccomData Group. Unlike typical fitness centers offering uninspired cuisine, Zen will feature a healthy, gourmet menu designed by top chefs from renowned restaurants. Guests will enjoy fully equipped gyms, swimming pools, and expert-led fitness programs. With an estimated two-year construction timeline, Zen is projected to begin generating returns by its second year of operation. Annual profits of $1 million are anticipated from the third year onward, with full investment recovery expected within four years of opening.

Risk Assessment
The financial projections account for potential economic downturns, ensuring conservative yet realistic expectations. Should the economy remain stable or improve, the investment recovery period and profitability timeline could be accelerated by up to 50%. To support a strong market entry and brand presence, a robust media campaign will be executed by Kudos Advertising Agency, targeting health-conscious travelers and luxury weekenders alike.</input>",0efc8863-e086-4c4a-aa14-7f688dec4cb3,7.0,0,0,0,True,0.5977,"{'Score 0': 0.5977, 'Score 1': 0.3201, 'Score 2': 0.0715, 'Score 3': 0.0051, 'Score 4': 0.0026, 'Score 5': 0.003}"

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: You are writing to Harry, a new manager in your company. He wants advice on how to effectively motivate his team and what strategies to avoid. Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Dear Harry,

I wanted to share a few ideas that could help you motivate your employees and boost their productivity.

Firstly, incentivizing employees can be a great way to encourage performance. When they see that their efforts contribute to the company's success and can lead to personal rewards, they are more likely to stay engaged. Additionally, taking an active interest in your employees' career paths by offering training and mentorship will show that you care about their growth and development.

A healthy work-life balance is also essential. Recognizing that employees have personal lives outside of work will help reduce burnout and increase overall satisfaction. Listening to your employees is another vital point; people feel valued when they are heard, even if they are voicing complaints. Moreover, treating your subordinates with respect and empathy fosters a positive environment where everyone feels supported.

On the flip side, here are some things to avoid that could demotivate your staff: disrespecting subordinates, taking credit for their work, losing your temper, allowing unfair blame, and failing to acknowledge good work.

I hope these suggestions are helpful! Best of luck managing your team.

Sincerely, [Diksha]","<input>Dear Harry,

Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a criticism of a celebrity. It can be a particular celebrity or the whole idea of celebrity in general. Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: nan,"<input>The idea of celebrity culture has both positive and negative aspects, but its drawbacks often outweigh its benefits. Many celebrities achieve fame not because of their talent or hard work but due to social media hype, controversies, or mere luck. This creates unrealistic role models who influence society in questionable ways.<code a=""PHRA"" c="" "">

</code>One major issue is the obsession with celebrities’ personal lives. The media constantly invades their privacy, and fans blindly follow every detail, often ignoring more important social issues. This idolization also promotes unhealthy beauty standards, as many celebrities undergo cosmetic procedures or excessive editing to maintain an unrealistic image. As a result, fans feel pressured to conform to these unattainable ideals.

Furthermore, some celebrities misuse their influence by spreading misinformation, engaging in scandals, or endorsing harmful products solely for profit. Despite their wealth and power, many fail to use their platform responsibly. Instead of focusing on meaningful contributions, they often prioritize personal gain over positive societal impact.<code a=""PHRA"" c="" "">

</code>Ultimately, while some celebrities do use their fame for good, the culture surrounding celebrity worship is largely problematic and distracts society from more significant matters.<code a=""PHRA"" c="""">

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: nan","<input>In Indian folklore, the Yeti, also known as the Abominable Snowman, stands out as a legendary creature steeped in mystery and intrigue. This elusive, ape-like being is said to inhabit the remote, snow-clad regions of the Himalayas, including areas like Ladakh, Kumaun, Himachal Pradesh, and Arunachal Pradesh. The Yeti is often described as a large, bipedal creature covered in shaggy white fur, leaving behind enormous footprints in the snow that have sparked curiosity and speculation for generations. Despite the harsh and unforgiving terrain, stories and claims of Yeti sightings persist, with locals and trekkers recounting encounters that range from fleeting glimpses to eerie sounds echoing through the mountain valleys.

In Northeast India, particularly in the dense, subtropical forests of Meghalaya's Garo Hills, tales of the Mande Burung, a creature similar to the Yeti, circulate among the indigenous communities. The Mande Burung is believed to be a more localized version of the Yeti, sharing many characteristics with its Himalayan counterpart. These creatures are often considered guardians of the forests, embodying the wild and untamed spirit of nature that remains a crucial part of Indian folklore and cultural heritage.

Indian folklore is rich with tales of mythical creatures that continue to captivate the imagination and are occasionally claimed to be sighted even today. Some of the most popular legendary beings include Shesha Naga, also known as Vasuki, which are serpent-like beings revered as water spirits and associated with fertility, wealth, and kingship. They are often linked with Hindu deities, especially Vishnu. Another revered creature is Garuda, a divine bird-like being that serves as the mount of Lord Vishnu and symbolizes power and divine protection. Additionally, Yakshas are nature spirits often depicted as guardians of treasures and natural elements, embodying the connection between humans and the natural world. These creatures not only represent various aspects of nature and spirituality but also play significant roles in the cultural narratives and religious practices of India.<code a=""PHRA"" c="""">

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Move over, werewolves and vampires. There’s a big, richly imaginative and extremely spooky world of desi ghosts, monsters and mythical creatures just waiting to devour…er to be discovered and given their rightful place in popular culture. Some of them can be found crawling through the pages of ancient texts, some adorn temple walls, while the stories of others are told through whispers and hushed songs, their forms changing and twisting with each narration. There are thousands of mythical creatures of Indian origin, but in the interest of space, attention span and potential Halloween costumes, we’ve prepared a list of seven fantastic creatures and where to find them (but hopefully you won’t go looking for them).

Tekhumiavi
The tale of the tekhumiavi or the were-tiger is popular among the Angami tribe of Nagaland. Unlike werewolves, were-tigers don’t transform from human to animal completely. Instead, only the soul of the human shifts to a tiger’s body, while the human body functions normally, albeit soulless for the time being. While in this form, the human behaves just like a tiger, and the human body experiences everything the tiger body does – somewhat like what happens in the Matrix. 

Now, how does one tell a tekhumiavi from a regular tiger? Simple – the were-tiger has five claws instead of four, so you can tell from the pugmarks. So, here’s something to look out for when you’re exploring the hills of Nagaland. 

Tekhumiavi
Penchapenchi
This monster out of Bengali folklore looks like an owl – yes, the dispenser of wisdom in animal stories – but it doesn’t exactly behave like one. A penchapenchi preys on forest dwellers, especially the ones who are foolish to wander off alone. Once the penchapenchi is sure that help is far away, it strikes down its prey and then drains their blood. Whether the victim turns into a penchapenchi (like in the case of a vampire bite) or not is yet to be confirmed.

Penchapenchi
Navagunjara
A mash-up of nine different animals, the navagunjara makes a special appearance in an Odia retelling of the Mahabharata as a manifestation of Vishnu. Story goes that when Arjuna, one of the Pandava princes, was in the middle of a penance, a strange creature appeared before him. Arjuna’s instinctive reaction, because he was terrified, was of course to point an arrow at it. The creature had the neck and head of a peacock, the hump of a bull, the waist of a lion, and the tail of a snake, and it stood on three different kinds of feet – an elephant’s, a horse or a deer’s and a tiger’s. Its fourth limb was human, which held a lotus. Before he let the arrow fly, Arjuna saw the lotus and realised what the creature truly represented. 

Navagunjara

Naale Ba
An urban legend, mostly based in Karnataka, demands that the words Naale ba or ‘come tomorrow’ be painted outside houses (with no spelling mistakes, mind) to ward off a witch, who likes knocking on doors at night and murdering whoever’s unlucky enough to open them. Thankfully, the witch’s kryptonite seems to be her own politeness.

Naale Ba
Nishi
Monsters really do have a thing for lone travellers, don’t they? The nishi, found mostly in the forests of Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand, are particularly vicious because they call out to their potential victims in the voice of their loved ones. Once the victims are lured into a well and truly secluded place, the nishi proceeds to kill them. Because they always appear in the distance, the only description we have of them is that they are shadowy creatures. Fortunately,  there is a way to identify these crafty creatures. If you hear the call thrice, you can rest assured that it’s not a nishi, because the ghost can, well, only be bothered to call out twice. The next time a loved one fondly calls out to you twice, there is no need to respond; flee.

Nishi
Gandeberunda
You probably already know the story of Narasimha, Vishnu’s hybrid avatar. Evil demon Hiranyakashipu gets a boon from Brahma that makes him practically invincible, which in turn gives him the licence to terrorize everyone. But when he tries to murder his own son, Vishnu decides that enough is enough and vanquishes Hiranyakashipu in the most creative way (you see, all boons come with loopholes) in his Narasimha avatar.

The story doesn’t end there though. Even with Hiranyakashipu out of the picture, Narasimha is still really, really angry, and afraid that his anger issues would destroy the world, the gods beseech Shiva to do something. Of course, the only way to tackle a powerful mythical creature is to turn into a powerful mythical creature yourself. Shiva becomes Sharabha – a half-lion (to match Narasimha, understandably) and half-bird form (the OG Angry Bird) – and manages to subdue Narasimha. The story is still not over, because Narasimha becomes Angrier Bird – taking on the form of Gandeberunda, a gigantic two-headed bird with Hulk-like strength. Sharabha, thankfully, calls it quits after 18 days of fighting and Gandeberunda also finally calms down. This powerful bird happens to be the state emblem of Karnataka, and the Gandeberunda motif can be found in many places in India, including temple architecture.

Bhoota Vahana Yantra
It appears that robots are quite ancient. According to an 11th-century text, when Buddha died, it fell to King Ajatashatru of Magadha to protect his sacred relics. Ajatashatru concealed the relics in a secret underground chamber in his capital, Pataliputra (now Patna in Bihar). And the warriors who stood guard were automatons, but not just any automatons though. Bhoota Vahana Yantra literally means ‘spirit movement machine’, so these robots had spirits inside them that were responsible for their movements. Needless to say, these robots made excellent guards.

The creature had the neck and head of a peacock, the hump of a bull, the waist of a lion, and the tail of a snake, and it stood on three different kinds of feet – an elephant’s, a horse or a deer’s and a tiger’s. Its fourth limb was human, which held a lotus. Before he let the arrow fly, Arjuna saw the lotus and realised what the creature truly represented.

Naale Ba
An urban legend, mostly based in Karnataka, demands that the words Naale ba or ‘come tomorrow’ be painted outside houses (with no spelling mistakes, mind) to ward off a witch, who likes knocking on doors at night and murdering whoever’s unlucky enough to open them. Thankfully, the witch’s kryptonite seems to be her own politeness.

Naale Ba
Nishi
Monsters really do have a thing for lone travellers, don’t they? The nishi, found mostly in the forests of Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand, are particularly vicious because they call out to their potential victims in the voice of their loved ones. Once the victims are lured into a well and truly secluded place, the nishi proceeds to kill them. Because they always appear in the distance, the only description we have of them is that they are shadowy creatures. Fortunately,  there is a way to identify these crafty creatures. If you hear the call thrice, you can rest assured that it’s not a nishi, because the ghost can, well, only be bothered to call out twice. The next time a loved one fondly calls out to you twice, there is no need to respond; flee.

Gandeberunda
You probably already know the story of Narasimha, Vishnu’s hybrid avatar. Evil demon Hiranyakashipu gets a boon from Brahma that makes him practically invincible, which in turn gives him the licence to terrorize everyone. But when he tries to murder his own son, Vishnu decides that enough is enough and vanquishes Hiranyakashipu in the most creative way (you see, all boons come with loopholes) in his Narasimha avatar.

The story doesn’t end there though. Even with Hiranyakashipu out of the picture, Narasimha is still really, really angry, and afraid that his anger issues would destroy the world, the gods beseech Shiva to do something. Of course, the only way to tackle a powerful mythical creature is to turn into a powerful mythical creature yourself. Shiva becomes Sharabha – a half-lion (to match Narasimha, understandably) and half-bird form (the OG Angry Bird) – and manages to subdue Narasimha. The story is still not over, because Narasimha becomes Angrier Bird – taking on the form of Gandeberunda, a gigantic two-headed bird with Hulk-like strength. Sharabha, thankfully, calls it quits after 18 days of fighting and Gandeberunda also finally calms down. This powerful bird happens to be the state emblem of Karnataka, and the Gandeberunda motif can be found in many places in India, including temple architecture.

Bhoota Vahana Yantra
It appears that robots are quite ancient. According to an 11th-century text, when Buddha died, it fell to King Ajatashatru of Magadha to protect his sacred relics. Ajatashatru concealed the relics in a secret underground chamber in his capital, Pataliputra (now Patna in Bihar). And the warriors who stood guard were automatons, but not just any automatons though. Bhoota Vahana Yantra literally means ‘spirit movement machine’, so these robots had spirits inside them that were responsible for their movements. Needless to say, these robots made excellent guards</code>.<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code><code a=""PHRA"" c="""">

New York City, often referred to as ""The Big Apple,"" is a bustling metropolis known for its vibrant culture and towering skyscrapers. The city thrives on its fast-paced lifestyle, with people constantly on the move. The energy in NYC is palpable, whether you're walking through Times Square or riding the subway. It’s a melting pot of cultures, and this diversity is reflected in its food, neighborhoods, and festivals. The iconic skyline, featuring landmarks like the Empire State Building, gives the city a unique, unmistakable character.

On the other hand, Tokyo, Japan, offers a very different but equally fascinating experience. The city blends modern technology with traditional customs, making it a unique fusion of old and new. While the streets of Tokyo are just as busy as New York’s, there’s a sense of calm in the midst of all the hustle. Tokyo’s meticulous organization is evident in its efficient public transport system and the careful balance of green spaces amid urban sprawl. Unlike NYC’s chaotic energy, Tokyo's vibe is more orderly yet still vibrant, offering a serene escape in its parks and temples.

Both cities offer remarkable experiences, but while New York pulses with raw energy and diversity, Tokyo provides a harmonious blend of tradition and modernity.

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: nan,"<input>Learning a new language can be an exciting yet challenging experience. Many language students encounter various issues along the way. One common challenge is **vocabulary retention**. Memorizing new words can be difficult, especially when the language has a significantly different structure or pronunciation. Students often struggle with remembering the meanings of words and using them in the correct context.

Another major difficulty is **grammar**. Each language has its own set of rules, and mastering these can take time. Students often face frustration when trying to grasp complex grammatical concepts like tenses, sentence structure, or gendered nouns, which can feel overwhelming and confusing.

**Pronunciation** is another common hurdle, particularly for students learning languages with sounds that don't exist in their native tongue. This can result in misunderstandings and difficulty being understood by native speakers.

**Motivation** is also a significant factor. Consistent practice is key to fluency, but it can be hard to stay motivated when progress feels slow or when students hit plateaus in their learning.

Lastly, **language anxiety** is a barrier for many students. Fear of making mistakes or not being able to communicate effectively can prevent learners from fully engaging in conversation practice. Overcoming these challenges requires patience, perseverance, and finding ways to stay motivated and confident in the learning process.</input>",43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a,15.0,0,0,0,True,0.578,"{'Score 0': 0.5781, 'Score 1': 0.2952, 'Score 2': 0.0739, 'Score 3': 0.0148, 'Score 4': 0.015, 'Score 5': 0.0229}"

"Prompt Level: 11.0 Prompt: Write a paragraph about how media has changed in your lifetime. What media was important before? What do you use now, and how has it changed your reading habits? Pay attention to your use of commas, colons and semicolons. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. Response: The media landscape has undergone dramatic changes over the past few decades, shaped by technological advancements, shifting consumer habits, and societal transformations. From the dominance of print newspapers to the rise of digital platforms, these changes have revolutionized how we create, consume, and interact with information.

1. Traditional to Digital
In the past, media was primarily distributed through newspapers, magazines, radio, and television. These formats followed a one-way communication model where media organizations produced content, and audiences consumed it passively. The internet disrupted this model, introducing digital media platforms that allow for instantaneous, global communication. Online publications, blogs, and social media have replaced much of the print industry, offering faster access to information and diverse perspectives.

2. The Rise of Social Media
Social media has transformed how we interact with media, making it more personal, participatory, and immediate. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter (now X), Instagram, and TikTok enable users to become content creators, bypassing traditional gatekeepers. This shift has democratized information but also introduced challenges, such as misinformation and the erosion of trust in reliable sources.

3. 24/7 News Cycle
The advent of cable news and later online news platforms introduced the 24/7 news cycle, drastically increasing the speed of reporting. While this provides timely updates, it also pressures media outlets to prioritize speed over depth, sometimes leading to inaccuracies or sensationalism.","<input>The media landscape has undergone dramatic changes over the past few decades, shaped by technological advancements, shifting consumer habits, and societal transformations.

Hello,

As you know, I need your help preparing a short presentation about the company for new recruits. Can you write up a short speech? Try to make it engaging; I don't want just a boring list of facts. Some key points to include:

• Frisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko.

• locations in 20 cities all over the world

• more than 5,000 employees

• our profit of 5 million dollars last year and 10 percent of the global market

• New employees are expected to be motivated and enthusiastic.

It might be useful to hold a quiz to see how much they already know about the company.

They might want to know something about me, so you can tell them about the time I fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. If you remember that story, you know that the passing ship that saved my life inspired me to start my own shipping company. Hopefully they'll see that as evidence that they can find inspiration anywhere.

And make sure to conclude the presentation by getting them to think and act. Please send me a draft of the speech by the end of tomorrow. Thanks!

Best regards,

Hi,

What a crazy week it's been for me. As you know, my work has been one of my major stressors, especially with the new management. They don't seem to understand how to motivate their staff, and when we do a good job, they don't acknowledge us. I'm not sure how much longer I can work here.

Also, do you remember Tia, the girl I met in the coffee shop a few months ago? Well, things aren't going well between us, and I think we might end the relationship. That's got me feeling really down because I thought it was going well for a while.

Sorry for bothering you with this – I've got no one else to talk about this, and I just needed to vent. You always seem to be so calm and in control; maybe you have some advice for me on how I can deal with these problems?

Thanks,

Thank you for the productive meeting! Now we have a clear idea what to put in the promo leaflet for the new Grand Hotel. Here's a quick summary:

Start with a concise introduction of the hotel. Mention the renowned FutureArc Agency that designed the hotel, and that it's designed to serve many needs - weekend getaways, business travel, meetings, etc.

Give a few more details about the hotel's highlights that may appeal to different customers.

the perfect location close to the heart of the city, convenient transport and nearby cultural attractions. Tourists would love this.

classy lounge and restaurant – a great choice for business travelers if they need to meet with partners or clients

spacious and well-equipped meeting space - can handle conferences and conventions

Come up with a tagline. The message is that every stay is different but memorable.
I'd like to have a draft of the promotional leaflet by the end of the week. Then we can get the design team to work on the layout. We'll also add some testimonials from reviewers later.

Response: nan","<input>When it comes to writing, we all have our own styles and preferences. For me, techniques like free writing and loop writing work wonders. They allow me to just let my thoughts flow without worrying about structure. It’s like giving my brain the freedom to think without any rules, and that often sparks creativity when I feel stuck. On the other hand, I find that listing helps me organize my thoughts, especially when I’m trying to write something more structured. It’s a great way to get my ideas out in a clear, logical format. I also love the idea of questioning, where I put myself in the reader's shoes and think about what they’d want to know.

Hope you are doing well. 

This email is regarding the policy changes which happened last week. I am looking forward for this new policy of coming up with the free breakfast to all employees in the company.  This is a great initiative taken up by the company. Now most of the employees don't have to worry about preparing breakfast in the morning. The mornings are sorted for all our employees. The breakfast menu is very healthy which will avoid our employees to eat anything junk. This will be a good start of the day. This will also help employees to reach office on time as the breakfast time will be only till 10 am.  

I hope everyone is as excited as I am, and I am hoping  that, with your help and creativity, this new policy will be a big success to our company.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Write a description, introducing the new bird species, comparing its appearance and habitat to that of the American robin, and classification using the formal zoological classification system. For the classification, suggest a name for the new species and say why it’s suitable. Use the email as reference. Response: nan","<input>**New Bird Species Description:**

A newly identified bird species has been discovered through DNA testing of several flocks previously believed to be American robins (*Turdus migratorius*). This discovery, led by Dr. Yamada, reveals a distinct yet closely related species within the *Turdus* genus.

**Appearance:**
The new species bears a strong resemblance to the American robin but exhibits several key differences. It is slightly smaller in size and has a notably larger bill. The male’s plumage features a rustier hue on the chest rather than the bright red seen in the American robin, giving it a more muted, earthy appearance.

**Habitat:**
Both species inhabit similar terrains, such as open woodlands and suburban areas. However, unlike the American robin, which migrates to the southern United States and Central America during the winter, the newly discovered species remains year-round in Canada. This non-migratory behavior is a distinctive ecological trait.

**Zoological Classification:**

* **Kingdom:** Animalia
* **Phylum:** Chordata
* **Class:** Aves
* **Order:** Passeriformes
* **Family:** Turdidae
* **Genus:** *Turdus*
* **Species:** *Turdus borealis* (proposed)

**Species Name Justification:**
The proposed species name, *Turdus borealis*, reflects the bird’s northern (boreal) range, especially its year-round presence in Canada. This name highlights a key ecological and behavioral distinction from its close relative, the American robin, and aligns with zoological naming conventions that emphasize geographic or characteristic differences.

This discovery enriches our understanding of avian diversity in North America and underscores the importance of genetic analysis in modern taxonomy.<code a=""PHRA"" c="""">

Dear Possible Med Student,

Thank you for your thoughtful questions! Pursuing medicine is indeed a profound commitment, and it's wise to seek insights.

**The Experience:** Being a doctor is incredibly rewarding<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code><code a=""PUNCT"" c=""—"">– </code>building deep patient relationships and solving complex problems offers unique fulfillment. However, it demands significant emotional resilience, long hours, and carries immense responsibility. Burnout is a real challenge requiring proactive management.

**Career Options:** It's far more diverse than just ""hospital doctor""! Beyond specialties like surgery, pediatrics, or cardiology, options include research, public health, health policy, medical education, pharmaceuticals, health tech, and global health. Your path unfolds after medical school and residency.

**Training Intensity:** Yes, medical training, <code a=""PUNCT"" c="""">**</code>especially clinical rotations and residency<code a=""NOUN"" c="""">**</code>, is exceptionally demanding. It combines long hours (often 60-80+ hours/week as a resident), high-stakes decision-making, constant learning, and emotional intensity. It's designed to prepare you for independent practice, but it *is* hard. Fellowships add further specialized training.

**Finances in Training:** Interns, residents, and fellows *are* paid stipends/salaries, but these are generally modest (often $50k-$70k/year depending on location/year). While enough for basic living expenses for a single person, it’s far below an attending physician's salary relative to hours worked. Budgeting is essential.

**Work Environments:** Clinics often offer more predictable hours focused on outpatient care and chronic disease management. Hospitals are fast-paced, involve acute/emergency care, shift work (nights/weekends), and complex team coordination. Both have unique pressures and rewards.

Shadowing doctors is the *best* way to get a true sense of daily life. It's a challenging but uniquely impactful career<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code><code a=""PUNCT"" c=""—"">– </code>go in with open eyes!

Best Wishes on Your Journey,

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: Buying a home in France, especially near Paris, can be both exciting and challenging. Prices are very high in this region, and the process involves several steps. For many people, one of the most complicated parts is applying for a home loan. It usually requires a lot of paperwork, including proof of income, bank statements, tax documents, and other financial details. This can be time-consuming and sometimes stressful.

Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, interest rates have increased significantly, making borrowing more expensive. Although rates are starting to stabilize in 2025, they are still higher than they were a few years ago. This means that buying property now often requires a larger budget or a longer loan term.

To make things easier, many people choose to work with professionals. A real estate agent helps find suitable properties and negotiate the price, while a mortgage broker assists with finding the best loan offer and managing the application process. These experts can be very helpful, especially for first-time buyers.

Overall, the process of buying a home in France is not necessarily difficult, but it does take time, preparation, and a good understanding of the system. With the help of the right professionals and a realistic budget, it is possible to become a homeowner—even in expensive areas like Paris and its suburbs, such as Vincennes, where I currently live and rent a flat with my spouse.","<input>Buying a home in France, especially near Paris, can be both exciting and challenging.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing.

Response: nan","<input>Among the nine writing techniques introduced, the most useful to me are free writing, focused free writing, and listing. Free writing helps me overcome writer’s block by allowing ideas to flow without judgment or structure. When I’m stuck, setting a timer and writing whatever comes to mind often uncovers unexpected insights or directions I hadn’t considered. Focused free writing takes that one step further by narrowing the topic, helping me stay on track while still benefiting from the spontaneity of the process.

Listing is also highly practical. It allows me to quickly generate and organize ideas before starting a draft. Whether brainstorming themes, outlining scenes, or gathering evidence for an argument, lists provide a clear starting point and a visual sense of structure. While metaphor and symbolism add depth to writing, I find them more effective in the revision stage. For getting started and generating raw material, free writing and listing are my go-to tools. These techniques help me build momentum and develop a foundation I can refine later.</input>",81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541,16.0,0,0,0,True,0.5005,"{'Score 0': 0.5005, 'Score 1': 0.2683, 'Score 2': 0.0856, 'Score 3': 0.0321, 'Score 4': 0.0441, 'Score 5': 0.0696}"

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Frisko Shipping! My name is Bill Frisko, and I’m the founder of the company you’re about to become a part of.

Before we dive into the details, let me start with a quick story. Years ago, I fell into the ocean—and yes, I was actually bitten by a shark. But the real turning point came when a passing cargo ship rescued me. That moment, floating in open water, taught me two things: one, never underestimate the ocean—and two, inspiration can strike in the most unexpected places. That moment inspired me to start this company in 2001.

Since then, Frisko Shipping has grown to more than 5,000 employees, with operations in 20 cities worldwide. Last year, we made $5 million in profit and now hold 10% of the global shipping market.

But none of that means anything without the right people. That’s why we expect our new team members—you—to bring motivation, energy, and fresh ideas.

To start, we’ll have a short quiz—let’s see what you already know about Frisko Shipping!
And as we go forward today, think about this: Where might your inspiration come from? And more importantly—what will you do with it?

</code>A good leader has the power to inspire others by creating a compelling vision for the future. They communicate this vision with passion and clarity, energizing their team and fostering a sense of purpose. For instance, a leader who aligns team goals with organizational values can motivate individuals to give their best. Inspiration is not about issuing orders but about igniting a shared belief in the potential of collective success.

Leadership involves guiding others while allowing them the space to grow. Effective leaders strike a balance between providing direction and empowering their team members. They serve as mentors, offering support and constructive feedback, while also entrusting their team with responsibilities. This balance helps individuals develop their skills and confidence, contributing to the overall success of the group.<code a=""PHRA"" c="" "">

Whether in the workplace, community, or family, everyone has the potential to embrace leadership roles and contribute to meaningful progress.

Dear Helena,

My name is Stef Shaw, from Special Projects. I received your contact details from Paul Liston. Paul has informed me that you have been developing a new system to manage your customer relationships and interactions. We are also looking for a way to do this.

I would like to enquire as to the possibility of collaborating on</code> this <code a=""PHRA"" c=""further"">project, or if you would consider our departments sharing the costs of development and maintenance if my team could use the system on a full-time basis.

I am very much looking forward to your response</code>.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The concept of celebrity has grown into something excessive, often prioritizing fame over real talent or meaningful contributions to society. Many celebrities achieve stardom not through skill or hard work but through controversy, social media antics, or sheer luck. While some use their influence responsibly, others seem more concerned with self-promotion than setting a good example. For instance, influencers and reality TV stars often gain millions of followers without showcasing any particular talent, yet they wield significant cultural influence.

Moreover, the lavish lifestyles of celebrities can be frustrating to watch, especially when they flaunt their wealth while many people struggle to make ends meet. Instead of using their platform for positive change, some celebrities engage in tone-deaf behavior, making them seem out of touch with reality. While admiration for talent and hard work is understandable, the culture of celebrity worship has become problematic. It promotes unrealistic beauty standards, fuels materialism, and sometimes even encourages irresponsible behavior. Instead of idolizing celebrities, society should focus on valuing people for their character, intelligence, and contributions to the greater good.

Hi Samantha,
I wanted to share a brief overview of my upcoming speech.
I'll begin by highlighting our success in renewing the partnership with Crum, emphasizing their praise for our team's commitment to quality.

Then, I'll address the challenges we faced, notably the unresolved defectrs from three months ago and some minor tech issues. I'll explain how we took immediate action to address these concerns.

For the solution, I'll focus on the improvements we've made, including a change in our update delivery system and strengthened Quality Assurance processes. These steps ensure the issues would not recur in the future.

To close, I'll look ahead, reassuring the team that we're committed to providing further support to avoid any future problems and to continue meeting customer expectations.

Please let me know if you'd like me to adjust anything

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane.

Response: nan","<input>Airplanes are a very important form of <code a=""MORPH"" c=""transportation"">transport</code> today. They help people travel long distances quickly and safely. Many people use airplanes for holidays, business trips, or to visit family in other countries.

An airplane has several important parts. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane. It holds the passengers, the pilots, and the cargo. The wings are attached to the fuselage. They help the airplane stay in the air and control its movement. The tail is at the back of the airplane. It helps keep the airplane stable during flight and supports direction changes<code a=""PHRA"" c="". Additionally, the engines are located either under the wings or at the rear of the fuselage. They provide the necessary thrust to propel the airplane forward""></code>.

Airplanes can fly very fast and high. Most commercial planes can carry over 100 people. Some modern planes even have Wi-Fi, food service, and movies during the flight. Pilots need special training to fly an airplane safely and correctly.

In conclusion, airplanes are useful machines that connect people around the world. Without them, international travel would be much slower and more difficult.<code a=""PHRA"" c="""">

Good morning Samantha. I’m thrilled to share some uplifting news—the winds of success have favored us, and we have renewed our partnership with Crum.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: When it comes to choosing favorite cities, New York City is always at the top of my list. The Big Apple is a whirlwind of energy, with its iconic skyline, diverse culture, and endless possibilities. It's the kind of place where you can find yourself eating a bagel in Central Park in the morning, visiting the Met in the afternoon, and catching a Broadway show by night. The city is a living, breathing entity, always on the move. The subway system, though sometimes chaotic, is a lifeline that connects the city's vibrant neighborhoods, each with its own unique flavor.

On the flip side, Tokyo offers a completely different but equally captivating experience. The first thing that strikes you about Tokyo is its incredible blend of the ultramodern and the traditional. One moment you're in the neon-lit streets of Shibuya, surrounded by towering digital billboards, and the next, you're in a serene temple in Asakusa, taking in the tranquility. Tokyo’s public transportation is a marvel of efficiency and cleanliness, making it easy to explore every corner of the city. The food scene is another highlight, with everything from world-class sushi to comforting bowls of ramen.

New York and Tokyo are both dynamic cities, but they offer different vibes. New York is all about diversity and cultural richness; it's a place where you can experience the world in a single city. Tokyo, on the other hand, impresses with its seamless integration of cutting edge technology and deeprooted traditions. Each city has its own unique charm and leaves a lasting impression, making them both top destinations on any traveler's list.","<input>When it comes to choosing favorite cities, New York City is always at the top of my list.

The captain, first officer, four flight attendants, and 141 passengers were not injured. The flight departed Oakland, California, at 1531 as a non-stop to Sky Harbor International Airport, Phoenix, Arizona.

The captain noted no problems during the initial departure, and observed a positive rate of climb. The flight crew noted </code>an error <code a=""PHRA"" c="""">message displayed on the control board.

The captain was asked to perform a flyby of the tower for verification on the gear status.

Here is a summary of the topics for the next meeting.
I was thinking that would be a great idea to start talking about the renewed partnership with Crum. We can also mention that Crum praised our dedication to quality.
Then I think we should include something about the unresolved defects we had three months ago and explain to them the reason of them. Also, we can briefly comment on the other tech issues, since even though they are a minor problem, the audience should be aware of them.
I’m considering highlighting the solution we developed for these problems, as the following: a) changed update delivery, and b) improved Quality Assurance processes.
In closing, I could be useful to mention that we are expecting further support to avoid problems with customers. 
Please, let me know your thoughts about this presentation and if you have any comments.

Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: You see a niche in the hotel market and decide to write a business proposal for investors. Write the **strategic summary** and **risk assessment** sections of the proposal using the notes. Write 140–200 words. Response: nan,"<input>Strategic Summary

Zen is a unique boutique hotel that combines the luxury of a spa with a health and fitness center. With a projected cost of $4 million, this project taps into the growing trend of weekend getaways to relaxing resorts and the increasing focus on healthy lifestyles, as confirmed by market research from AccomData Group. Additionally, a survey revealed that most fitness centers offer unsatisfying cuisine, creating an opportunity for Zen to offer a healthy menu curated by top chefs from renowned restaurants. The hotel will feature fully equipped gyms, swimming pools, and trained instructors to enhance the guest experience. Construction is expected to take two years, with a return on investment forecasted for the second year after opening. The projected profit will reach $1 million per year starting in Year 3, with the investment fully recouped by Year 4 and profit generation beginning in Year 5.

Risk Assessment

The projected figures have accounted for any potential economic downturns, ensuring that even in a challenging economy, the hotel remains financially viable. However, if the economy remains stable, the time required to recoup the investment and realize profits could be halved. To support the hotel's success, an intensive media campaign will be led by Kudos Advertising Agency, maximizing exposure and attracting a steady stream of guests.<code a=""PHRA"" c="""">

Closing Arguments:

Plaintiff’s Lawyer:

Argued that the defendant knowingly entered private property without permission.

Emphasized the emotional distress and inconvenience caused to the plaintiff.

Requested compensation for damages and legal costs.


Defendant’s Lawyer:

Claimed the defendant believed they had implied consent to enter the property.

Argued there was no damage or harm caused by the entry.

Suggested the incident was a misunderstanding, not intentional trespassing.<code a=""PHRA"" c=""

</code>Verdict:

The court found in favor of the plaintiff.

The judge stated that the defendant did not have permission to enter the property, regardless of intent.

Intent is not always required for trespassing — unauthorized entry alone is enough.

Emotional distress and inconvenience can influence the court’s decision.

You can start with just the opening for now. The presentation will be about how our company started, the changes that have occurred in the past few years, and our plans for the future. Where possible, try to include interesting facts about the company. For example, most people know us as a finance company, but a lot of people</code> don't <code a=""VERB"" c=""realize"">know</code> that we actually started <code a=""PART"" c="""">out </code>in the travel industry. And remember to introduce yourself, since there will be a lot of unfamiliar faces in the audience.<code a=""PHRA"" c="" "">

</code>Could you please send me the draft by the end of the week?<code a=""ORTH"" c="" ""></code>

Thanks.<code a=""ORTH"" c="" ""></code>

Findings: In Rio de Janeiro, only 35% approved of the shirt, with 20% indicating they would purchase it. In contrast, Shanghai showed a more favorable response, with 80% approval and 40% willing to buy. Key reasons for disapproval included issues related to design, size, color, and material.

Conclusions: The collarless dress shirt is not highly desirable in Rio, primarily due to dissatisfaction with its design and execution. Conversely, the product has potential in Shanghai, but improvements are still necessary to enhance customer satisfaction.

Recommendations: Prioritize further market research to understand men<code a=""NOUN:POSS"" c=""’s"">'s</code> preferences in accessories.

AccomData Group, which we hired to conduct market research, reported that this project had found a niche  in the growing popularity of weekend getaways to relaxing resorts and increased consumer focus on healthy lifestyles. Market research reveals dissatisfaction with the quality of cuisine offered in most fitness centers. Zen will fill this gap by featuring a healthy menu crafted by top chefs from renowned restaurants. The hotel will also offer fully equipped gyms and swimming pools staffed by trained instructors, creating a comprehensive wellness experience. 

We forecast an almost immediate return on your investment. With a $4 million investment and an estimated construction time of two years, Zen is projected to begin returning profits by the second year after opening, with annual profits reaching $1 million. The initial investment is expected to be recouped within four years, making this an attractive opportunity for investors.

RISK ASSESSMENT
We've factored any possible economic downturn into our forecasted revenues and profit. If the market remains stable, the timeline for recouping investment and achieving profits could be cut in half.

Dear Valued Shareholders,

We want to address your concerns and reaffirm Future Foundations Construction Company's strong and stable position in the market.

First, let us be clear: the recent rumors about share prices plummeting are entirely false. While it is true that share value experienced a brief dip two months ago due to the resignation of our former CEO, Greg Johnson, this was a temporary adjustment. Since then, with the appointment of Harry Levi—an industry leader with a stellar reputation—our share value has recovered and reached a historic high.

In an ever-fluctuating construction market, Future Foundations continues to thrive by focusing on stability and sustainable growth. We have secured three major contracts for the next three years, guaranteeing steady profits and reinforcing our leadership in the industry.

We deeply value your loyalty and belief in our mission. With your support, the company is on track for a promising future. To further reassure you, we will soon share our comprehensive five-year roadmap outlining our plans for continued growth and innovation.

Thank you for your trust. Together, we will build an even brighter future for Future Foundations.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: In my country, purchasing a home and applying for a home loan is a complex process. Over the last three decades, housing prices have varied significantly between urban and rural areas, with properties in major cities being considerably more expensive. For instance, in the capital city, high demand has led to inflated prices, making homeownership more challenging for first-time buyers.
The process itself involves several steps. First, you need to be sure of the amount of money you can invest and the amount of loan you intend to request from the bank. Additionally, it's essential to compare loan interest rates across different banks and understand the conditions you must meet. Interest rates fluctuate based on economic conditions, typically ranging from 3% to 6%. Both fixed and variable rate options are available, with fixed rates offering stability and variable rates sometimes providing lower initial payments.
After choosing the right bank, you can contact various real estate agents to help find properties that fit your budget and preferred location. While it’s not legally required to use a real estate agent, many people find it helpful as agents can show a variety of properties, navigate legal requirements, and ensure the seller provides all necessary documents.
Once you find the property you want, you and the seller go to a notary to sign a pre-contract, marking the start of the legal process. With this pre-contract, you return to the bank, which requires filling out several forms and providing documentation like proof of income, credit history, and personal identification. After the loan is approved, you finalize the purchase with a notary. The final contract replaces the pre-contract and is registered in your name, while the mortgage serves as collateral for the loan.
Overall, the process can be time-consuming and somewhat stressful, especially in competitive markets, but with the right guidance, it is manageable.","<input>In my country, purchasing a home and applying for a home loan is a complex process.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: nan","<input>One legendary creature that fascinates me is the Wendigo, a figure deeply rooted in Native American folklore, especially in the northern regions of the United States and Canada. The Wendigo is a malevolent spirit associated with winter, starvation, and greed. It is said to be a cannibalistic creature, often described as gaunt, emaciated, and towering, with glowing eyes, sharp claws, and a mouth that’s forever hungry. It is often portrayed as a human transformed by its insatiable hunger into a monster.

The Wendigo is linked to the dangers of winter and the extremes of human survival, particularly in the harsh, remote wilderness. Folklore warns that those who resort to cannibalism in times of famine are cursed to become Wendigos themselves, driven by an endless craving for human flesh. The creature represents the consequences of surrendering to greed and isolation.

While the Wendigo is mainly a cautionary tale, it has also made its way into modern pop culture, appearing in books, movies, and TV shows. Its eerie presence and the themes of survival, hunger, and madness continue to captivate people's imaginations.</input>",f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad,16.0,0,0,0,True,0.5845,"{'Score 0': 0.5845, 'Score 1': 0.3203, 'Score 2': 0.0659, 'Score 3': 0.0098, 'Score 4': 0.0085, 'Score 5': 0.0112}"

Congratulations on your new role! When it comes to motivating your team, it's essential to focus on clear communication, regular feedback, and fostering a positive environment. Setting clear expectations helps your team understand their goals, while regular feedback, both positive and constructive, ensures they know how they’re progressing and where they can improve. Encourage a collaborative culture where team members can share ideas and support each other, creating a sense of belonging and collective achievement. Recognizing achievements, big or small, can go a long way in boosting morale—whether it's a simple thank you or public acknowledgment in a meeting. However, be mindful of strategies that can backfire. Micromanaging your team can lead to frustration and decreased motivation, as it undermines trust. Also, avoid a one-size-fits-all approach to motivation; different team members are driven by different factors, so it’s crucial to understand individual needs and adjust accordingly. Best of luck in your new role, and don't hesitate to reach out if you ever need advice!

Response: Criticizing the concept of celebrity culture, one can argue that it often promotes superficial values and unrealistic standards. Celebrities are frequently idolized for their appearance, wealth, and lifestyle rather than their character or contributions to society. This can lead to a culture where materialism and vanity are celebrated, overshadowing more meaningful achievements. Additionally, the constant media scrutiny and pressure to maintain a perfect image can have detrimental effects on celebrities' mental health, leading to issues such as anxiety and depression. While some celebrities use their platform for positive change, many others seem to prioritize personal gain over social responsibility.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Now prepare the content for an informative web page about counterfeit goods. Be sure to keep the following points in mind: Types of counterfeit goods, the effect of counterfeiting on society, the signs of a fake, what to do if you discover fake goods.  Write 250-300 words. Response: nan","<input>Beware of Counterfeit Goods: What You Need to Know

Counterfeit goods are fake products made to look like genuine items. They often imitate well-known brands and are sold at lower prices. Common types of counterfeit goods include designer clothing and accessories, electronics, cosmetics, medications, toys, and even food products. These items may look real on the outside, but they often fail to meet quality and safety standards.

The effects of counterfeiting go far beyond individual buyers. Fake goods harm the economy by taking business away from legitimate companies. They also lead to job losses and reduced innovation. Some counterfeit items—especially cosmetics, medicines, and electronics—can be dangerous, putting people’s health and safety at risk. Profits from counterfeit sales can even fund organized crime and illegal activities.

To protect yourself, it’s important to learn the signs of a fake. Be cautious of products sold at very low prices, especially if they’re from unknown websites or street vendors. Watch for poor packaging, spelling errors, or unusual logos. If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Buying from authorized stores or official brand websites is the safest choice.

If you suspect you’ve purchased a counterfeit product, avoid using it—especially if it's something you apply to your skin or consume. Contact the seller and ask for a refund. Report the fake item to the brand owner or local authorities so they can investigate. You can also alert consumer protection agencies or websites that track counterfeit products.

By staying informed and alert, you help fight counterfeiting and protect yourself and others from its harmful effects.<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code></input>",788dc6fa-5111-4a7c-b2c1-a9ddebd0b1a2,7.0,0,0,0,True,0.5845,"{'Score 0': 0.5845, 'Score 1': 0.3279, 'Score 2': 0.0792, 'Score 3': 0.0046, 'Score 4': 0.0019, 'Score 5': 0.002}"

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: The question of whether companies have a responsibility to society or if their primary obligation lies solely with shareholders is a complex and highly debated issue. I firmly believe that companies do have a responsibility to society, and this perspective aligns with the growing movement toward corporate social responsibility (CSR). First of all, companies are integral parts of the communities in which they operate. They benefit from the resources, infrastructure, and workforce that these communities provide. Businesses thrive in environments that are stable, sustainable, and supportive. Therefore, it is not only ethical but also pragmatic for companies to engage in practices that uplift their communities. This two-way relationship fosters goodwill and can enhance company's reputation, leading to increased customer loyalty and, ultimately, better financial performance.
Furthermore, the modern consumer is increasingly aware and concerned about social and environmental issues. As noted by Jack@MSU, a strong CSR record can significantly influence consumer choices. Companies that demonstrate a commitment to ethical practices and social responsibility often enjoy enhanced brand loyalty and, consequently, improved sales. This suggests that doing good and doing well are not mutually exclusive but can go hand-in-hand.
On the other hand, the arguments against CSR, such as those presented by Milton Friedman and others, emphasize a more traditional view that prioritizes shareholder profit above all else. While it is essential for businesses to be profitable, this narrow focus can lead to short-term thinking and potentially harmful practices that disregard the broader implications of their operations on society and the environment. Moreover, the argument that it is the government's 
role to enforce social responsibility fails to acknowledge that businesses have a unique opportunity to drive positive change. Many societal issues can be more effectively addressed by innovative corporate strategies rather than relying solely on regulatory frameworks. Companies have the resources and influence to implement impactful initiatives that address social challenges directly, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future. In conclusion, I believe that companies not only have a responsibility to their shareholders but also to the societies in which they operate. By embracing CSR, businesses can build stronger relationships with their communities, enhance their brand reputation, and ultimately drive sustainable success. ","<input>The question of whether companies have a responsibility to society or if their primary obligation lies solely with shareholders is a complex and highly debated issue. I firmly believe that companies do have a responsibility to society, and this perspective aligns with the growing movement toward corporate social responsibility (CSR). First of all, companies are integral parts of the communities in which they operate. They benefit from the resources, infrastructure, and workforce that these communities provide. Businesses thrive in environments that are stable, sustainable, and supportive. Therefore, it is not only ethical but also pragmatic for companies to engage in practices that uplift their communities. This two-way relationship fosters goodwill and can enhance <code a=""DET"" c=""a ""></code>company's reputation, leading to increased customer loyalty and, ultimately, better financial performance.<code a=""PHRA"" c=""

"">
</code>Furthermore, the modern consumer is increasingly aware and concerned about social and environmental issues. As noted by Jack@MSU, a strong CSR record can significantly influence consumer choices. Companies that demonstrate a commitment to ethical practices and social responsibility often enjoy enhanced brand loyalty and, consequently, improved sales. This suggests that doing good and doing well are not mutually exclusive but can go hand-in-hand.<code a=""PHRA"" c=""

"">
</code>On the other hand, the arguments against CSR, such as those presented by Milton Friedman and others, emphasize a more traditional view that prioritizes shareholder profit above all else. While it is essential for businesses to be profitable, this narrow focus can lead to short-term thinking and potentially harmful practices that disregard the broader implications of their operations on society and the environment. Moreover, the argument that it is the government's <code a=""PHRA"" c="""">
</code>role to enforce social responsibility fails to acknowledge that businesses have a unique opportunity to drive positive change. Many societal issues can be more effectively addressed by innovative corporate strategies rather than relying solely on regulatory frameworks. Companies have the resources and influence to implement impactful initiatives that address social challenges directly, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future. In conclusion, I believe that companies not only have a responsibility to their shareholders but also to the societies in which they operate. By embracing CSR, businesses can build stronger relationships with their communities, enhance their brand reputation, and ultimately drive sustainable success.<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code></input>",8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799,13.0,5,4,-1,False,0.4148,"{'Score 0': 0.0006, 'Score 1': 0.002, 'Score 2': 0.0259, 'Score 3': 0.2002, 'Score 4': 0.4148, 'Score 5': 0.3562}"

So, with this in mind, I couldn't talk about the major problem we saw 3 months ago. Effectively, the unresolved defects affecting our shoppers. Briefly, I have to mention the other tech issues that we have also met. I've told you about the issues and now it's time to talk about solution.

</code>I agree that we need to act soon before rent hikes affect us more. I've been thinking about this, and I’d like to propose a third option that combines both of your ideas while solving our biggest concerns.

What if we relocate to downtown? It’s not as expensive as downtown (rent is about $2,800), but it’s becoming a popular spot with boutique cafés, art studios, weekend markets<code a=""PUNCT"" c="", ""></code>and is commercially growing.

At the same time, we could enhance our online presence and offer remote measurement visits like Ken suggested. This hybrid model would keep the personal touch and reduce costs while expanding our reach.<code a=""PHRA"" c=""

Write 150-200 words. Response: NAFTA is an abbreviation for the North American Free Trade Agreement. To be more specific, it was an economic agreement between the US, Canada, and Mexico, and it came into force in January 1994 after several years of negotiation. 

After this agreement commenced, it had a profound effect on trade relations among these participating countries, especially on agriculture. Despite the Mexican agriculture sector having particular concerns about the influx of agricultural products, it turned out that trade within the region had expanded, and income had increased, especially in Mexico.  What this meant was that rather more Mexican fruits and vegetables flowed into the US.

NAFTA was basically for reducing or eliminating barriers to customs duties and investments among these three countries. Although there were some negative impacts, like charging trade competition and job migration, it mostly had positive influences on all participants. To put it another way,  NAFTA was generally beneficial to the North American economy.","<input>NAFTA is an abbreviation for the North American Free Trade Agreement.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: he debate on whether companies have a responsibility to society or solely to their shareholders is a complex one that reflects broader questions about the role of business in the contemporary world. Both perspectives present valid arguments, and my position leans towards a balanced approach that acknowledges the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) while recognizing the need for profitability.

On one hand, companies undoubtedly have a significant impact on the communities in which they operate. This impact extends beyond economic contributions to include environmental and social dimensions. As lil@213 mentioned, businesses and communities exist in a symbiotic relationship. Companies benefit from the resources, labor, and infrastructure provided by these communities, and, in return, they have a moral obligation to contribute positively to societal well-being. Moreover, as Jack@MSU highlighted, CSR can enhance a company's reputation and foster customer loyalty, ultimately benefiting the bottom line. Consumers today are increasingly aware of and concerned about the ethical practices of the companies they support, making CSR not just a moral choice but a strategic business decision.

On the other hand, critics like theG8T remind us of Milton Friedman's view that a corporation's primary responsibility is to its shareholders. While profit is undoubtedly a key driver of business success, this perspective can be too narrow, especially in an era where social and environmental challenges are pressing. JackD_92 points out that CSR efforts are sometimes perceived as mere marketing strategies rather than genuine contributions, which can undermine their effectiveness and authenticity.

A middle ground can be found by recognizing that businesses can pursue profit while also addressing societal needs. This is not only feasible but often beneficial in the long term. Companies that integrate CSR into their core operations can innovate, improve risk management, and create a sustainable competitive advantage. It's also important to note, as patty925 suggests, that governments play a crucial role in setting the regulatory framework within which businesses operate. Effective regulation can guide and incentivize companies to act in socially responsible ways without usurping the role of businesses in driving innovation and economic growth.","<input><code a=""SPELL"" c=""The"">he</code> debate on whether companies have a responsibility to society or solely to their shareholders is a complex one that reflects broader questions about the role of business in the contemporary world.

I'm sorry for you and the week you had. Remember that you can cope with those stressors. Sometimes you can feel frazzled because of your workload or your relationships, but try to have a breather.
Try to have some days off at work. I'm sure you will be able to ruminate your problems in a serene place. Prioritize your tasks, and decide what it important and what is not.
If you are unhappy in your work, maybe it's good time to look for something different, uplifting.
If things aren't going well between you and Tia, try to ruminate about the cause. If you found out that things can get better, fight for it. If not, maybe the best solution is to split now, before hurting each other.
You know you can always count on me. Come to my place and spend some days with me. Maybe it will do any good for both.

Response: nan","<input>The Hang Seng Index (HSI), <code a=""PHRA"" c="""">which is </code>a major stock market index in Hong Kong, has experienced notable and steady growth over the past six months. This positive trend is largely attributed to significant investment inflows from Mainland China, which have boosted investor confidence and market activity. Among the various sectors represented in the index, the Properties and Utilities Sub-indices have shown particularly dramatic increases. This surge is closely linked to the robust economic growth and demand coming from China, which has had a direct impact on these sectors. Six months ago, the HSI experienced a decline, dropping to 20,956 points. However, since that low point, the index has rebounded impressively, reaching a high of 27,499. Financial experts and market analysts are optimistic about the future performance of the Hang Seng Index. They believe that the index will continue to rise in the coming year, driven not only by ongoing massive investments from other countries but also by strong internal demand within Hong Kong itself.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: nan,"<input>In today's society, the notion of celebrity often constitutes a paradoxical blend of admiration and skepticism. Celebrities, whether they are actors, musicians, or influencers, wield significant power through their ability to shape public opinion and dictate trends. However, this influence frequently appears detached from substantive contributions to cultural or intellectual domains. The relentless pursuit of fame has led to an industry where image often supersedes talent, with social media platforms magnifying superficial qualities over genuine skill or dedication. Furthermore, the lives of celebrities, splashed across tabloids and television screens, project an unattainable standard of living, perpetuating unrealistic expectations among their audience. This idealized glamour masks the inherent struggles and imperfections of these individuals, presenting a facade that can be both aspirational and destructive. Critically, the attention lavished upon celebrities may divert public discourse from pressing societal issues, prioritizing ephemeral gossip over meaningful conversations. In essence, while the celebrity sphere can offer moments of entertainment, it is crucial to approach it with a discerning perspective, recognizing its potential to distract from the pursuit of substantive cultural and intellectual growth.</input>",121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4,16.0,0,0,0,True,0.5586,"{'Score 0': 0.5586, 'Score 1': 0.2769, 'Score 2': 0.0764, 'Score 3': 0.0205, 'Score 4': 0.0271, 'Score 5': 0.0406}"

Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: nan,"<input>**Corporate Social Responsibility: A Necessity, Not a Choice**<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code><code a=""PHRA"" c=""

""> 

</code>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is no longer just a voluntary initiative for businesses—it is a crucial factor in long-term success. In today’s world, companies are expected to contribute positively to society while maintaining profitability.<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code><code a=""PHRA"" c=""

""> 

</code>First, CSR enhances a company’s reputation. Businesses that actively engage in ethical practices, environmental sustainability, and community development build trust with consumers. Customers are more likely to support brands that align with their values, leading to increased loyalty and sales.<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code><code a=""PHRA"" c=""

""> 

</code>Second, CSR fosters employee satisfaction and retention. A company that prioritizes social responsibility creates a positive work environment, making employees feel valued. When workers believe in their company’s mission beyond profit-making, they become more engaged and productive.<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code><code a=""PHRA"" c=""

""> 

</code>Additionally, CSR helps businesses mitigate risks. Companies that ignore social and environmental concerns may face legal consequences, public backlash, or financial losses. Implementing responsible business practices reduces these risks and ensures long-term sustainability.<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code><code a=""PHRA"" c=""

""> 

</code>However, some argue that CSR diverts resources from core business operations. While there are costs involved, the long-term benefits—brand loyalty, employee engagement, and risk reduction—far outweigh the expenses. <code a=""PHRA"" c=""

""> 

</code>In conclusion, CSR is not just an ethical obligation but a strategic investment. Companies that integrate social responsibility into their operations create value for themselves and society. A responsible business is a successful business.</input>",8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799,13.0,0,0,0,True,0.5806,"{'Score 0': 0.5806, 'Score 1': 0.3071, 'Score 2': 0.0771, 'Score 3': 0.0124, 'Score 4': 0.0097, 'Score 5': 0.0134}"

Preliminary checks suggest possible minor issues with the nose gear shock absorption system. Weather conditions were within operational limits, but the gusts were stronger than forecasted. The flight crew followed standard procedures and responded promptly to the situation.

The aircraft has been temporarily grounded for a full inspection. Further investigation is underway to determine whether any mechanical or procedural factors contributed to the incident.

Zen aims to capitalize on the growing trend of weekend getaways to relaxing resorts and the increasing focus on a healthy lifestyle, as identified by market research from the AccomData Group. Our boutique hotel will stand out by offering a unique blend of luxury accommodation and comprehensive wellness facilities. Unlike typical fitness centers that offer unsatisfying cuisine, Zen will feature a healthy menu crafted by top chefs from renowned restaurants. Guests will enjoy access to fully equipped gyms and swimming pools, with guidance from trained instructors. The construction of Zen is estimated to take two years, with a return on investment expected in the second year after opening. We project an annual profit of $1 million starting in the fifth year, with the investment recouped within four years from opening.

Risk Assessment

Our financial projections account for potential economic downturns. If the economy remains stable, the timeframe for recouping investment and realizing profits could be reduced by half. To ensure a successful launch, we have partnered with Kudos Advertising Agency to run an intensive media campaign, aimed at establishing Zen as a premier destination for those seeking a luxurious and health-focused retreat.","<input>Strategic Summary

Response: nan","<input>Counterfeit Document Detection – Forensics Expert Notes

Paper Quality

Genuine documents are printed on specific, often high-quality paper.

Counterfeits may use standard or thinner paper that feels different to the touch.

Watermarks

Many official documents include embedded watermarks.

Hold the paper up to the light to check for authenticity.

Security Threads and Fibers

Some documents contain embedded threads or visible colored fibers.

These are hard to replicate without special materials.

Ink and Printing Techniques

Real documents may use special inks (e.g., UV-sensitive ink, microprinting).

Counterfeit documents often use laser or inkjet printers, which leave visible print patterns under magnification.

Serial Numbers and Codes

Check for consistent placement and proper formatting.

Mismatched fonts or spacing are red flags.

Holograms or Foil Seals

Common on IDs and certificates.

Hard to duplicate accurately and often absent in counterfeits.</input>",8b0a764a-4cfb-498f-8a8f-6264ffb7c64c,7.0,0,0,0,True,0.5806,"{'Score 0': 0.5806, 'Score 1': 0.344, 'Score 2': 0.072, 'Score 3': 0.0019, 'Score 4': 0.0007, 'Score 5': 0.0007}"

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: The landing gear should be retracted after liftoff when the airplane has reached an altitude where the airplane could no longer be landed on the runway if there is a power failure.
Landing gear is extended by placing the gear selector switch in the GEAR DOWN position.
The airspeed will decrease and the pitch attitude may increase.
During the several seconds it takes for the gear to extend, the pilot should be attentive to any abnormal sounds or feel.
The pilot should confirm that the landing gear has extended and locked by the normal sound and feel of the system operation as well as by the gear position indicators in the cockpit.
In most airplanes, the gear switch is shaped like a wheel in order to facilitate positive identification and to differentiate it from other cockpit controls.
A landing gear safety switch, sometimes referred to as asquat switch, is usually mounted in a bracket on one of the main gear shock struts.
The pilot should then turn on thebattery master switch and ensure that the landing gear position indicators show that the gear is down and locked.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: Use the information in the notes to write an informative text about NAFTA, or write about a trade agreement your country is a part of. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: NAFTA: The North American Free Trade Agreement. 
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a significant trade agreement that involves three member states: the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This agreement officially came into force in January 1994, following years of negotiation aimed at fostering economic cooperation and trade among the three nations.

One of the primary objectives of NAFTA was to reduce or eliminate customs duties on goods traded between the member countries. This has led to a notable increase in trade volume, particularly in the agricultural sector. For instance, the flow of Mexican fruits and vegetables into the United States has surged, benefiting consumers with a wider variety of fresh produce.

While NAFTA has had a profound impact on trade relations, it has also generated both positive and negative effects for the member countries. On the positive side, it has facilitated economic growth and job creation in certain sectors. However, some industries have faced challenges, leading to job losses in specific areas.

Overall, despite the complexities and mixed outcomes, NAFTA has provided significant benefits to all three member states, enhancing their economic ties and fostering a more integrated North American market.","<input>NAFTA: The North American Free Trade Agreement. <code a=""PHRA"" c="""">

The city pulses with life—trams clatter through colonial streets, street food stalls serve spicy delights, and bookstores line College Street. It’s a place where art and activism coexist, where every corner tells a story. The humid air may cling to your skin, but the warmth of the people makes up for it. Festivals like Durga Puja transform the city into a glowing celebration of tradition and creativity.

Then there’s Shimla, a serene hill station nestled in the Himalayas. Unlike Kolkata’s bustling energy, Shimla offers calm. Pine-scented air, winding roads, and colonial architecture create a peaceful retreat. The Mall Road buzzes gently with tourists, and the cool climate invites long walks and quiet reflection. While Kolkata inspires action, Shimla encourages pause.

Both cities are rich in charm, but where Kolkata fuels my curiosity, Shimla soothes my soul. Each offers a different rhythm—one fast and fiery, the other slow and serene.</input>",bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4,15.0,0,0,0,True,0.563,"{'Score 0': 0.563, 'Score 1': 0.3103, 'Score 2': 0.0769, 'Score 3': 0.0147, 'Score 4': 0.0152, 'Score 5': 0.0203}"

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: While learning a new language can be thrilling, it sometimes also victuals innumerable problems. One common difficulty is memorizing vocabulary. Some students may have difficulty memorizing words, and may not make use of them prominently in their conversant life. Pronunciation is yet another great difficulty, in fact it varies from language to language. Certain sounds in French or Mandarin could be completely alien to an English speaker.
Furthermore, one can add that some grammar rules might seem very tricky and bewildering. For example, learning correct usage of verb tenses in English and the understanding of gendered nouns in Spanish require some regular practice and patience. The major barrier would be the fear of making mistakes thereby harming the confidence to speak with a native speaker.

This will tell students, they can carry out this challenge by adopting the right strategy. A few moments of daily practice contribute a lot toward activating learned knowledge. Language apps do a great job of getting students interested; watching feature films and listening to music are also great tools. Engaging in language exchange programs or quite simply practicing with friends also really helps increase confidence.

Write 150-200 words. Response: nan,"<input>Subject: Fascinating Article on Future Travel Trends

Hi Team,

I came across an intriguing article about evolving trends in transportation and travel that I think you’ll find interesting. It discusses three major areas shaping the future of <code a=""PHRA"" c=""travel"">how we get around</code>.<code a=""ORTH"" c="" ""></code>

First, it highlights a shift away from personal car ownership, especially among younger generations. Many are opting for public transport due to its sustainability, cost savings, and the ability to stay connected or productive during commutes.

Second, the article explores changes in air travel. Airlines continue to cut costs, which has led to the rise of budget carriers offering cheaper flights. While this means fewer luxuries, it makes flying more accessible to many travelers.

Lastly, it delves into the exciting prospect of space tourism. Although currently limited to the ultra-wealthy, this industry is growing. There’s potential for space travel to eventually become a mainstream vacation option in the future.

I think you’ll enjoy the insights on these transformative developments. Here’s the link: [Insert Link].

Best,

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Now write a report comparing the two car designs. Which design do you think you should go with? Persuade your design team to choose one of the designs for next year’s rollout. Write 100-150 words. Response: In today’s fast-paced automotive market, making the right car buying decision can be like navigating a complex maze. With numerous brands, models, specifications, options, colors, packages, and prices to consider, potential car buyers often find themselves overwhelmed by choices.

JATO’s recent survey of 2,500 future car buyers revealed that 29% of people would research online first when buying a new car. This is where car comparison tools can prove to be essential for securing new and repeat business on automotive websites.
1) Streamlining decision-making process
Imagine a customer is in the market for a hatchback and they’re looking at your brand. There are many things for them to consider – from price points to specification requirements – so having the right information is crucial to support the sales journey.

 

Using a car comparison tool, they can effortlessly access the facts they need, compare your model offering against direct competitors and evaluate specifications side by side. From engine performance and fuel efficiency to safety features and advanced technology, they will have a comprehensive overview that highlights key advantages and differences.

 

This information gives customers clarity and helps to simplify the decision-making process.
 Enhancing transparency and trust
Transparency is a cornerstone of modern business practices. By offering a car comparison tool, your brand can demonstrate its commitment to providing potential buyers with an honest and unbiased evaluation of their offerings. This fosters trust and reinforces the brand’s credibility – both crucial factors in building lasting customer relationships, recommendations, and repeat business.

 

3) Customisation tailored to individual preferences
Car comparison tools go beyond listing features. They allow potential buyers to explore the various options, colours, and packages available for each model. This means that a buyer can seamlessly experiment with different specifications according to their preferences, budget, and what is available in the market today.

 

According to JATO’s recent research, the top options people like to add if they have remaining budget are safety features (parking sensors, lane assist etc.). Therefore, a car comparison tool that allows customers to compare safety options from multiple brands – from price to capability – can enhance the customer experience.

 

Offering high levels of customisation and direct access to information gives the car buyer more power, ensuring that the final purchase aligns with their preferences and requirements.

 

4) Offering a digital first experience
The car buying journey has previously involved extensive research, various dealership visits, and test drives. Today, car comparison tools enable brands and customers to streamline the initial research phase, saving valuable time and energy. Customers browsing your website can now conveniently access all the information they need in one place, making the process more efficient and increasing customer satisfaction.

Life is a constant journey of transformation, where every step we take, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, shapes the person we become. We often find ourselves at <code a=""DET"" c="""">a </code>crossroads, unsure of which direction to take, or struggling with the weight of our own expectations. But it’s in these moments of uncertainty that we are presented with the greatest opportunities for growth.

From the moment we are born, we begin the process of learning, adapting, and evolving. As children, we rely on the guidance of our parents, teachers, and mentors to navigate the world around us. Our minds are like sponges, absorbing new information and experiences at an astonishing rate. With every new skill we acquire and every milestone we reach, we build the foundation for the person we will become.

But as we grow older, we often encounter challenges that test our resilience and character. These challenges can take many forms: personal setbacks, failures, and losses. Sometimes, they come in the form of external circumstances, like the loss of a job, a broken relationship, or a health crisis. Other times, they are internal struggles, such as self-doubt, fear of failure, or a lack of confidence.

In these moments, it’s easy to feel defeated, as though we are stuck in a never-ending cycle of struggle. But it’s important to remember that growth doesn’t happen without challenges. In fact, it’s often through hardship that we learn the most about ourselves. When we face adversity, we are forced to confront our weaknesses, face our fears, and tap into reserves of strength we never knew we had<code a=""PHRA"" c="""">.

One of the most important lessons in life is that growth is not linear. We often think of progress as a straight line, a clear path from where we are to where we want to be. But in reality, growth is messy. It’s full of twists and turns, ups and downs, moments of doubt and clarity. There are times when we take two steps forward and one step back, and other times when we feel like we’re standing still. Yet, even when we don’t see immediate results, progress is still being made.

It’s also important to understand that growth is deeply personal. Each person’s journey is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. While there are general principles for success—such as hard work, perseverance, and resilience—the path to fulfillment is different for everyone. Some people find joy in their careers, while others find it in their relationships, creative pursuits, or spiritual practices. The key is to listen to your inner voice, trust your instincts, and be open to the lessons that life has to offer.

As we navigate this journey, we must also learn to embrace change. Change is inevitable, yet it often brings with it a sense of fear and resistance. Whether it’s changing careers, moving to a new city, or starting a family, the unknown can be intimidating. But change is also the catalyst for growth. It forces us to step outside our comfort zones and challenge the status quo. It compels us to see the world from new perspectives and adapt to new circumstances.

One of the most powerful tools for embracing change is cultivating a mindset of curiosity. When we approach life with an open mind and a willingness to learn, we can transform even the most difficult experiences into opportunities for growth. Instead of seeing challenges as obstacles, we can view them as puzzles to solve, mysteries to unravel. This shift in perspective can make all the difference in how we experience the world.

Another important aspect of growth is self-compassion. In our quest for success, it’s easy to become our own harshest critics. We judge ourselves for our mistakes, our perceived shortcomings, and our failures. But self-compassion is the key to overcoming this self-sabotage. When we treat ourselves with kindness and understanding, we create space for growth and healing. We realize that making mistakes is a natural part of the process and that we don’t have to be perfect to be worthy of love and success.

In addition to self-compassion, it’s important to surround ourselves with positive influences. The people we spend time with have a profound impact on our growth and well-being. It’s essential to build relationships with individuals who uplift, inspire, and challenge us to be better versions of ourselves. Whether it’s friends, family, mentors, or colleagues, the right people can help us navigate life’s challenges and celebrate our victories along the way.

One of the greatest gifts we can give ourselves is the freedom to pursue our passions. Too often, we get caught up in the expectations of others or society’s standards of success. We pursue careers, relationships, and goals that don’t align with our true desires, simply because we feel obligated to do so. But true fulfillment comes when we follow our hearts and pursue the things that make us feel alive. Whether it’s writing, painting, traveling, or starting a business, pursuing our passions gives us a sense of purpose and direction.

It’s also important to remember that the journey of life is not just about achieving external success, but about cultivating inner peace and contentment. In a world that often values productivity and achievement above all else, it’s easy to get caught up in the pursuit of more: more money, more accolades, more recognition. But true happiness comes from within. It’s about finding peace in the present moment, appreciating the simple things in life, and letting go of the need for constant validation.

This doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t strive for our goals or work hard to achieve our dreams. It simply means that we should approach life with a sense of balance. We should set goals, but not at the expense of our well-being. We should strive for success, but not at the cost of our inner peace. Ultimately, the most fulfilling lives are those in which we pursue our passions while maintaining a sense of gratitude and contentment for the present moment.

As we continue on our journey, we must also learn to embrace the beauty of impermanence. Life is fleeting, and everything in it—our experiences, relationships, and even our own lives—is temporary. But this impermanence is what makes life so precious. It reminds us to cherish every moment, to savor the highs and learn from the lows, and to appreciate the people who walk alongside us on this journey.

In the end, the journey of life is not about reaching a destination, but about embracing the process of growth. It’s about learning, evolving, and becoming the best version of ourselves. It’s about celebrating the moments of joy, finding meaning in the moments of struggle, and cultivating a sense of peace and gratitude for the journey itself.

So, as you continue on your own journey, remember that growth is a lifelong process. Embrace change, trust in your own resilience, and allow yourself the space to evolve. Seek out experiences that challenge you, and surround yourself with people who inspire you. Be kind to yourself when things don’t go as planned, and always remember that the greatest growth often comes from the most difficult times.

Above all, stay curious. The world is full of endless possibilities, and with each new experience, you have the chance to discover something new about yourself and the world around you. So take a deep breath, keep moving forward, and embrace the adventure that is your life</code>.</input>",56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd,15.0,0,0,0,True,0.58,"{'Score 0': 0.5801, 'Score 1': 0.3364, 'Score 2': 0.0707, 'Score 3': 0.0061, 'Score 4': 0.0032, 'Score 5': 0.0033}"

Include an introduction, a body (with signposting phrases, where possible), an anecdote and a call to action. Write 150–250 words. Response: Good morning everyone, and welcome to Frisko Shipping!

I’m excited to have the opportunity to introduce you to our company today. I know you’ve all come here with great enthusiasm and a desire to be part of something special, and I can promise you, Frisko Shipping is exactly that. But don’t just take my word for it—let’s dive into the story behind our global success and see why you’re joining a team that’s truly exceptional.

Let me begin with a brief history.
Frisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko, a visionary with a passion for global trade. What started as a small shipping company has now grown into a powerhouse with locations in 20 cities across the world. With over 5,000 employees, we’ve built an international network that moves millions of goods every day, connecting markets and communities in ways that many companies only dream of.

Last year, we achieved a profit of 5 million dollars and captured 10% of the global market. It’s an impressive track record, and it reflects the dedication of every person who has worked here—and now, that includes you!

But it’s not just about the numbers. We believe that people are at the heart of everything we do. We want you to bring your enthusiasm, your motivation, and your drive to the table. New employees like you are expected to bring fresh ideas and energy into the company, and in return, we promise you’ll be part of a company that values growth, creativity, and a strong sense of teamwork.

Now, let me share an anecdote about Bill Frisko himself.
Many of you may already know that Bill’s journey to founding Frisko Shipping wasn’t a typical one. In fact, it was an experience that could’ve been the end of his career. On one of his early adventures, Bill fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. But rather than letting this life-changing moment defeat him, Bill saw it as a sign to make a change. In fact, the very ship that rescued him became the inspiration for the birth of Frisko Shipping. Bill often says that you can find inspiration in the most unexpected places—even in the middle of a life-threatening situation. And that’s the kind of mindset we value here. Anything can happen, and with the right perspective, it can lead to incredible opportunities.

Before I finish, I want to make sure you’re thinking ahead—not just about what Frisko Shipping is today, but about what we can become together. So, here’s a little challenge for you: How much do you really know about the company you’ve just joined? I’d like to kick things off with a fun quiz to see how many facts you’ve already picked up. It’s a great way to test your knowledge and get you even more excited about being a part of our journey.

In conclusion, as you step into your new roles, remember that you’re not just joining a company—you’re joining a movement. A movement that began with a spark of inspiration and has grown into something truly global. So, let’s work together, think outside the box, and continue to build on the foundation of success that we’ve all worked so hard to create.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The dragon is one of the most iconic creatures in legends around the world, including Italy. Unlike its eastern counterpart, the Western dragon is depicted as a massive, winged, fire-breathing beast with tough scales and a long, spiked tail. In European folklore, it symbolizes power, destruction, and greed. Often, dragons are seen as the ultimate challenge for heroes, guarding ancient ruins or hidden treasures.

In Italy, one famous legend tells the story of Tarantasio, a serpent-like dragon said to live in Lake Gerundo, in Lombardy. According to the tale, it terrorized local villages by poisoning the water and devouring cattle until a brave knight finally defeated it.

In modern culture, dragons remain popular in fantasy literature and movies. In The Lord of the Rings, Smaug is a cunning and greedy dragon who hoards gold in the Lonely Mountain. In Harry Potter, dragons are powerful magical creatures used in the Triwizard Tournament. These stories continue to inspire our imagination, keeping the legend of dragons alive.","<input>The dragon is one of the most iconic creatures in legends around the world, including Italy.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: What problems can happen on board a ship? What are some solutions? Use your own ideas. Choose from one or two of the options provided and write 80-100 words. Options: general cargo safety and stowage; staffing levels and working conditions; general condition and maintenance of the vessel; safety standards; pollution Response: 

One common problem on board a ship is poor cargo stowage, which can cause items to shift during rough seas, creating serious safety hazards. A solution is to ensure all cargo is properly secured using safety nets and locks, and to conduct regular inspections. Another issue is pollution, especially from oil leaks or waste disposal. To solve this, ships should follow strict environmental regulations, use eco-friendly systems, and train the crew in waste management. These actions help keep the vessel safe and protect the ocean environment.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: The fuselage is the body of the aircraft. The landing gear can be retracted into the undercarriage of the fuselage after take-off and must be in a GEAR DOWN position before landing. All passenger seats are located in the fuselage, as well as the cockpit and cargo storage locations. Attached to the fuselage are the wings. Due to the curved shape of the upper part of the wing it creates lift, but - by increasing the angle of attack and thus increasing lift - also more drag. For take-off and landing the pilot should use the flaps to decrease the stall speed. At the end of each wing you can find the ailerons. These parts are controlled by moving the stick in the cockpit left and right, causing the airplane to roll into the desired direction. Simultaneously using the rudder to support the directional change is key to a nice and clean turn. The rudder is part of the vertical stabilizer at the tail of the aircraft and controls the rate of turn. Another part of the tail is the horizontal stabilizer. This system is used to change the angle of attack and therefore the rate of climb and the altitude of the aircraft. Last but not least it depends on the type of aircraft which engine type is used. Generally, today there are two common types of engines used in aviation: Single engine piston engines, which commonly run on aviation gas (AVGAS), or turbines, which use jet-fuel or kerosene.

Hi Ken and Josh,

Thanks for sharing your thoughts—both of your ideas have strong points. I’d like to propose a third option that might offer a balance between cost savings and customer experience.

What if we relocate to the <code a=""NOUN"" c=""Riverwood"">East Market</code> District? It’s a <code a=""ADV"" c=""rapidly ""></code>growing area just 10 minutes from downtown, with significantly lower rent—around $<code a=""PHRA"" c=""2,500"">2,800</code>/month for similar-sized spaces. The district is becoming popular with boutique businesses and has good foot traffic, especially on weekends. We could set up a smaller showroom there to maintain a physical presence and continue offering personalized service.

At the same time, we could expand our digital presence and offer on-site fittings at offices and schools, as Ken suggested. This hybrid model would allow us to reduce costs, retain loyal customers, and reach new ones through convenience and technology.

We could also host monthly pop-up events downtown to stay visible in the high-traffic area without the full-time rent commitment.

Let me know what you think—happy to explore this further!

Best,

A home loan can be opted to buy a new house/flat or a plot of land where you construct the house, and even for renovation, extension, and repairs to an existing house.<code a=""PHRA"" c=""

</code>Types of Home Loans in India
Home Loan
 
This is the most common type of home loan availed to purchase a house. There are many housing finance companies, public banks, and private banks that offer housing loans where you borrow money to purchase the house of your choice and repay the loan in monthly <code a=""NOUN"" c=""installments"">instalments</code>.

You can get up to 80%-90% of the house’s market price in the form of financing. The lender will hold the house until you completely repay the loan.<code a=""PHRA"" c=""

"">
 

</code>Home Construction Loan
 
This is the right home loan type if you already have a plot of land and you need financing to construct a house in that land.<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code><code a=""PHRA"" c=""

"">
 

</code>Home Extension Loan
 
Say you already own a house and you would like to extend the house with another room or another floor to accommodate the growing family. Home extension loan provides financing for this purpose.<code a=""PHRA"" c=""

"">
 

</code>Home Improvement Loan
 
A home improvement loan provides financing for renovating or repairing the house if there’s any fault in the existing system, such as painting the house’s interior or exterior, plumbing, upgrading the electrical system, waterproofing the ceiling, and more.<code a=""PHRA"" c=""

"">
 

</code>Home Loan Balance Transfer
 
The current home loan interest rate may be overwhelming, or you may not be happy with your current lender’s service; you can transfer the home loan’s outstanding balance to a different lender who offers a lower interest rate and better service. Upon transfer, you can even check out the possibilities<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code><code a=""PHRA"" c="""">of a top-up loan on your existing one. 
 

Composite Home Loan
 
This type of home loan provides financing for purchasing the plot of land where you would like to construct a house and for the construction, both within a single loan. 

Benefits of Taking a Home Loan
Tax benefits

The foremost benefit of a home loan is the income tax deduction you can claim on the interest and principal repayments. You can claim up to Rs.1.5 lakh on principal repayments u/s 80C, up to Rs.2 lakh on interest repayments u/s 24B, up to Rs.2 lakh on interest repayment in special circumstances u/s 80EE and 80EEA, and up to Rs.1.5 lakh on stamp duty expenses u/s 80C.
 

Lower interest rate

The home loan interest rate is much lower as compared to any other loan types available. If you come across a cash crunch, you may get a top-up on the existing home loan at a lower interest rate than a personal loan to solve the issue.
 

Due diligence of property


When you go through a bank to purchase a house, the bank will conduct thorough checks on the property from the legal perspective and check if all the documents produced are valid.

This due diligence check from the bank’s end will reduce the risk of you being scammed. If the bank approves the property, that means you and your house are safe.
 

Long repayment tenure
 

Unlike any other loans, home loans come with longer repayment tenure, as much as 25-30 years. This is owing to the significant loan amount one will have to borrow to purchase a house.

Spreading the loan amount and interest applicable over a longer tenure will reduce the monthly EMIs reducing the borrower’s burden.</code></input>",e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9,16.0,0,0,0,True,0.3577,"{'Score 0': 0.3577, 'Score 1': 0.3149, 'Score 2': 0.1722, 'Score 3': 0.0928, 'Score 4': 0.0489, 'Score 5': 0.0133}"

we want to inform you about a big change in our company, a new modern design for our logo!
The main reason of this choice is related to a market research we did, the survey showed the people liked the product but they considered that the former logo was old fashioned. With the new design we aim to keep those customers and to not lose them.
In addition, we stongly believe that a new logo can also improve the reputation we have in the leadership of our market.

We hope you like the new logo and if you have any suggestions or opinions about the change we are happy to discuss about them together. 

Looking forward to having any feedback from you.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, metaphor and symbolism stand out as particularly useful to me. Metaphors allow for vivid and imaginative comparisons, making abstract concepts more relatable and engaging. For instance, describing time as a ""thief"" can evoke a strong emotional response and convey the fleeting nature of moments. This technique enriches writing by adding layers of meaning and enhancing the reader's experience.

Symbolism, on the other hand, imbues objects, characters, or events with deeper significance, often reflecting broader themes. This technique can subtly guide the reader to uncover hidden messages and insights within the text. For example, using a storm to symbolize turmoil or a rose to represent love can create powerful imagery and resonance.

Focused free writing is another valuable technique, as it encourages the flow of ideas without the constraints of structure or perfection. This method can help overcome writer's block and generate raw, authentic content that can later be refined.

Overall, these techniques—metaphor, symbolism, and focused free writing—are instrumental in crafting compelling narratives that captivate and provoke thought, making them indispensable tools in my writing arsenal.","<input>Among the nine writing techniques introduced, metaphor and symbolism stand out as particularly useful to me.

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: You're going to write about an interesting, fictional event that happened to a friend. Write your blog post. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The Power of Small Habits for Big Change

We often hear that change is difficult, but what if we told you that small habits could lead to big transformations? The truth is, lasting change doesn’t happen overnight. It’s not about making drastic shifts, but rather about committing to small actions consistently over time. Whether it’s reading for 10 minutes a day, taking a short walk every morning, or drinking more water, these tiny habits compound and create significant change in the long run.

Small habits are easier to maintain because they don’t require a complete overhaul of your life. They’re more sustainable, less overwhelming, and allow you to ease into bigger goals. As you build momentum, these actions become part of your routine and start to feel automatic, helping you improve productivity, health, and overall well-being.

What’s more, small habits give you the flexibility to adjust and grow at your own pace. You’re not pressured to be perfect, and setbacks don’t derail your progress. Instead, each small action becomes a stepping stone toward your bigger dreams.

So, if you're looking to create meaningful change, start small. Consistency is key, and over time, your little habits will lead to major transformations in your life.

</code>Hi everyone,

I just read an article that gives a fascinating overview of current and future trends in transportation, and I thought you'd be interested.

The article highlights three major areas. First, it discusses how personal car use in the U.S. is declining, especially among young professionals. Many prefer public transport because it allows them to stay connected, work during commutes, and reduce their environmental impact.

Second, it looks at the air travel industry. Airlines continue to cut costs, which has led to fewer services but also made flights more affordable. The growth of budget airlines means that travel is now more accessible, even for those on tighter budgets.

Finally, the article explores the exciting idea of space tourism. While currently limited to the wealthy, companies are already working toward making it a viable industry. If prices drop in the future, it could become a mainstream travel option.<code a=""PHRA"" c=""

Hope to see you all read the full article!"">

Hey,

I’ve had a look at your draft speech. Overall, I think you’re on the right track but I’d suggest adding a little more cohesion so it all hangs together better. Each point should flow smoothly from the last, and it helps to refer back to previous points when relevant. You might also want to use different words to refer to Crum so you don’t repeat yourself too much.

"Prompt Level: 14.0 Prompt: Using your notes, draft a speech with a consistent metaphor. Add variety by using different terms for teams and problems. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: nan","<input>Ladies and Gentlemen,

Today, I want to talk about our journey towards enhancing our team’s skills and capabilities. Think of our training program as a ship navigating through the vast ocean of knowledge. We’ve evaluated two potential vessels to carry us forward: TrainQuick and Skills Pro.

TrainQuick is like a small, nimble boat. It’s cost-effective and flexible, but we’ve noticed that our crew members in other branches aren’t boarding it. They find it uncomfortable to mix with sailors from different ships, which hampers their learning experience.

On the other hand, Skills Pro is a sturdy, well-equipped ship. It’s more expensive, and some have found the journey challenging, but those who embark on it often reach their destination successfully. Moreover, Skills Pro plans to expand its fleet, offering even more opportunities for growth.

Given these considerations, I recommend we set sail with Skills Pro. Yes, it requires a larger investment, but the quality of the voyage and the success of our crew are paramount. By choosing Skills Pro, we ensure that our team is well-prepared to navigate the challenges ahead and reach new horizons.

Let’s embark on this journey together, confident that we are making the best choice for our future.

Thank you.<code a=""PHRA"" c="""">

Good morning everyone,

I’m pleased to share a key achievement: we’ve successfully renewed our partnership with Crum. This milestone reflects not only the strength of our collaboration but also the trust they place in our team. In fact, Crum specifically praised our unwavering commitment to quality—a recognition that speaks volumes about our shared values and consistent performance.

Body:

However, this success didn’t come without its challenges. Just three months ago, we were facing a series of unresolved defects that threatened to disrupt our delivery timelines. Alongside these, we encountered additional technical issues that, while minor, added complexity to the situation.

Recognizing the urgency, we took swift and strategic action. First, we restructured how updates are delivered, ensuring greater stability and predictability. Building on that, we enhanced our Quality Assurance processes to catch and resolve issues earlier.

What truly enabled these improvements was the exceptional collaboration across teams. By working together seamlessly, we turned a difficult situation into an opportunity to strengthen our operations.

Closing:

Looking ahead, we’re committed to deepening our support for Crum and proactively preventing similar issues with our customers. This renewed partnership isn’t just a continuation—it’s a step forward in how we deliver value, build trust, and grow together.

Tokyo, the bustling capital of Japan, is a city that never sleeps. It is a hub of modernity, with its towering skyscrapers, neon lights, and cutting-edge technology. The city is a paradise for tech enthusiasts and fashion lovers alike, offering a plethora of shopping districts, entertainment options, and gourmet restaurants. The fast-paced lifestyle in Tokyo is invigorating, with its efficient public transportation system and endless opportunities for exploration.

In contrast, Kyoto, the ancient capital, offers a serene and historical experience. Known for its well-preserved temples, traditional tea houses, and beautiful gardens, Kyoto is a haven for those seeking tranquility and a connection to Japan's rich cultural heritage. The city's slower pace allows for leisurely strolls through bamboo groves and visits to centuries-old shrines. Kyoto's charm lies in its ability to transport visitors back in time, providing a stark contrast to Tokyo's futuristic vibe.

While Tokyo dazzles with its modernity and energy, Kyoto captivates with its timeless beauty and peaceful ambiance. Both cities offer unique experiences, making them must-visit destinations for anyone traveling to Japan. Whether you prefer the excitement of a metropolis or the calm of a historical city, Tokyo and Kyoto each have their own special allure.</input>",bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4,15.0,0,0,0,True,0.571,"{'Score 0': 0.5708, 'Score 1': 0.3064, 'Score 2': 0.0721, 'Score 3': 0.0143, 'Score 4': 0.0155, 'Score 5': 0.0207}"

Thanks for reaching out — you’re not bothering me at all. I’m really glad you felt comfortable enough to share this with me. It sounds like you’re going through a lot right now, and it makes total sense that you’re feeling overwhelmed.

When it comes to work, I totally get how frustrating it can be when your efforts go unnoticed. It might help to focus on what you can control — like celebrating your own wins or even having a calm conversation with management about how acknowledgment could boost morale. But if it feels like things won’t change and it’s taking a toll on your mental health, it might be worth thinking about what your next steps could be. You deserve to work somewhere that values you.

I’m really sorry to hear things aren’t going well with Tia. It’s tough when you feel like something that seemed promising starts to fade. Maybe having an honest conversation with her could bring some clarity — whether that means working through it or finding closure. Either way, it’s okay to feel down about it. Relationships can be messy, and it takes time to heal when things don’t go as you hoped.

I know it probably feels heavy right now, but you’re not alone in this. If you ever want to talk or just need someone to listen, I’m here. You’re strong, even if it doesn’t feel that way right now — and I believe you’ll get through this.

Take care of yourself, okay?

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Learning a new language can be an exciting yet challenging journey. Language students often face several issues and challenges that can impact their progress and motivation. What are some common obstacles they encounter, and how can they overcome them?

One major challenge is pronunciation. Many students struggle with mastering the sounds and intonations of a new language, which can lead to misunderstandings and frustration. To tackle this, students can practice with native speakers, use language learning apps, and engage in listening exercises to improve their pronunciation.

Another issue is vocabulary retention. Memorizing new words and phrases can be daunting, especially when they don't seem to stick. Techniques such as spaced repetition, flashcards, and incorporating new vocabulary into daily conversations can help reinforce learning.

Grammar is another hurdle. Understanding and applying grammatical rules can be complex, leading to errors and confusion. Students can benefit from studying grammar in context, using language learning resources, and seeking feedback from teachers or language exchange partners.

Cultural differences also play a role. Language is deeply intertwined with culture, and students may find it challenging to grasp idiomatic expressions, humor, and social norms. Immersing oneself in the culture through media, travel, and interaction with native speakers can provide valuable insights and enhance language learning.

Lastly, motivation can wane over time. Maintaining enthusiasm and consistency is crucial for language acquisition. Setting realistic goals, celebrating small achievements, and finding enjoyable ways to practice can keep students motivated.

By addressing these challenges with effective strategies, language students can navigate their learning journey more smoothly and achieve their goals.","<input>Learning a new language can be an exciting yet challenging journey.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: This page shows the parts of an airplane and their functions. Airplanes are transportation devices which are designed to move people and cargo from one place to another. Airplanes come in many different shapes and sizes depending on the mission of the aircraft. The airplane shown on this slide is a turbine-powered airliner which has been chosen as a representative aircraft.

Wings
For any airplane to fly, one must lift the weight of the airplane itself, the fuel, the passengers, and the cargo. The wings generate most of the lift to hold the plane in the air. To generate lift, the airplane must be pushed through the air. The air resists the motion in the form of aerodynamic drag. Modern airliners use winglets on the tips of the wings to reduce drag. The turbine engines, which are located beneath the wings, provide the thrust to overcome drag and push the airplane forward through the air. Smaller, low-speed airplanes use propellers for the propulsion system instead of turbine engines.

Vertical and Horizontal Stabilizer
To control and maneuver the aircraft, smaller wings are located at the tail of the plane. The tail usually has a fixed horizontal piece, called the horizontal stabilizer, and a fixed vertical piece, called the vertical stabilizer. The stabilizers’ job is to provide stability for the aircraft, to keep it flying straight. The vertical stabilizer keeps the nose of the plane from swinging from side to side, which is called yaw. The horizontal stabilizer prevents an up-and-down motion of the nose, which is called pitch. (On the Wright brother’s first aircraft, the horizontal stabilizer was placed in front of the wings. Such a configuration is called a canard after the French word for “duck”).

At the rear of the wings and stabilizers are small moving sections that are attached to the fixed sections by hinges. In the figure, these moving sections are colored brown. Changing the rear portion of a wing will change the amount of force that the wing produces. The ability to change forces gives us a means of controlling and maneuvering the airplane. The hinged part of the vertical stabilizer is called the rudder; it is used to deflect the tail to the left and right as viewed from the front of the fuselage. The hinged part of the horizontal stabilizer is called the elevator; it is used to deflect the tail up and down. The outboard hinged part of the wing is called the aileron; it is used to roll the wings from side to side. Most airliners can also be rolled from side to side by using the spoilers. Spoilers are small plates that are used to disrupt the flow over the wing and to change the amount of force by decreasing the lift when the spoiler is deployed.

Flaps and Spoilers
The wings have additional hinged, rear sections near the body that are called flaps. Flaps are deployed downward on takeoff and landing to increase the amount of force produced by the wing. On some aircraft, the front part of the wing will also deflect. Slats are used at takeoff and landing to produce additional force. The spoilers are also used during landing to slow the plane down and to counteract the flaps when the aircraft is on the ground. The next time you fly on an airplane, notice how the wing shape changes during takeoff and landing.

Fuselage
The fuselage or body of the airplane, holds all the pieces together. The pilots sit in the cockpit at the front of the fuselage. Passengers and cargo are carried in the rear of the fuselage. Some aircraft carry fuel in the fuselage; others carry the fuel in the wings.

As mentioned above, the aircraft configuration in the figure was chosen only as an example. Individual aircraft may be configured quite differently from this airliner. The Wright Brothers 1903 Flyer had pusher propellers and the elevators at the front of the aircraft. Fighter aircraft often have the jet engines buried inside the fuselage instead of in pods hung beneath the wings. Many fighter aircraft also combine the horizontal stabilizer and elevator into a single stabilator surface. There are many possible aircraft configurations, but any configuration must provide for the four forces needed for flight. ","<input>This page shows the parts of an airplane and their functions.

I love basketball and the story of the movie: Bud Air was amazing.   Is a 1997, sports comedy-drama film directed by Charles Martin Smith. Air Bud received mixed reviews but was a commercial success, grossing $4 million in its opening weekend and totaling $27.8 million in its run against an estimated $3 million budget. An international co-production of the United States and Canada, the film stars Kevin Zegers as a young boy who befriends a runaway Golden Retriever (portrayed by Buddy) with a unique ability to play basketball. One day after school, Josh practices basketball by himself in a makeshift court that he sets up behind an abandoned church, where he meets an abandoned and runaway Golden Retriever who had recently escaped from his abusive owner.","<input><code a=""PHRA"" c="""">

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a paragraph describing how robots are being used in your country. How do you feel about them? In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: In France, robots are used in various sectors and improve the efficiency and safety of activities, their main uses are :
In industry to automate repetitive tasks to improve productivity, accuracy and working conditions. The negative aspect is that the low-skilled people who used these tasks before the use of robots no longer have a job and are difficult to reclassify.
In agriculture for cattle milking, cleaning and feeding, in wine production and market gardening, these autonomous robots reduce the use of chemical weed killers and preserve the soil.

For healthcare, robots can help surgeons with complex or remote procedures.
French companies are developing exoskeletons that allow paraplegics to regain mobility, or to help workers to carry heavy loads.

For security and emergency response, they allow access to dangerous areas without risk to firefighters, police or military.

Robotics in France is booming, in my opinion the only negative aspect being, as mentioned earlier, that it takes jobs away from low-skilled people who are difficult to reemploy.

Robots associated with AI will continue to advance in proportions that are difficult to imagine.

I trust you're both well. I've been reflecting on our current situation and think I've identified a promising alternative solution that could address our concerns and needs effectively. Please consider this proposal.

How about moving our showroom to the newly developed Riverside Market area? This location is gaining popularity thanks to its variety of dining options, boutique stores, and entertainment venues, attracting significant foot traffic. The rent is quite reasonable at $3,200 per month, and the area's increasing popularity could help us reach a wider range of customers.

This move would allow us to preserve the personal touch and physical presence Josh values, while also adopting a more modern business approach with a better website as Ken has recommended. It's a way to offer both the physical experience of our fabrics and in-person consultations, and the convenience of online shopping.

Moreover, Riverside Market frequently hosts community events and markets, presenting an excellent opportunity for us to participate and introduce our clothing line to a larger audience. We could also provide on-site measurements during these events to attract new customers who might not find us otherwise.

I believe this strategy offers a good compromise between keeping our bespoke service and reducing expenses. Let's discuss this further to see if it aligns with our objectives.

Last weekend, my friend Clara and I stumbled upon something we never expected while hiking in the woods. We had just finished a long trail and were walking back down a narrow path<code a=""PUNCT"" c="" "">, </code>when Clara spotted a rusted metal box half-buried under a pile of leaves. At first, we thought it was just an old tin, but curiosity got the better of us, and we decided to open it.

Inside was a collection of odd, but fascinating items: a cracked wristwatch, a faded photograph of a family, a couple of old coins, and a small notebook with a handwritten date—July 23, 1985. Clara, always the history buff, was immediately intrigued. The photograph seemed to be of a man and a child, possibly from the 1980s, though the details were unclear. The notebook contained cryptic notes about ""finding the right time"" and ""waiting for the signal.""

We tried to research it online, but there were no clues about its origin. The whole thing felt like a piece of a forgotten story—one that might never be fully told. Still, the mystery of that time capsule made our hike unforgettable, and we’re still piecing together its significance.

Write 150-200 words. Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into force in January 1994, after years of negotiation, creating a trilateral trade bloc between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
 Its primary aim was to reduced or eliminated customs duties among the members such as tariffs, and foster economic integration among the three nations. The NAFTA has had a profound impact on trade relations, especially in agriculture; for example, Mexican fruits and vegetables flow into the US.Additionally, NAFTA encouraged foreign direct investment, enhancing the competitiveness of industries within the bloc.
NAFTA also faced criticism. Critics pointed to job losses in certain industries, particularly in manufacturing, due to companies relocating to Mexico for cheaper labor. Environmental concerns and the exploitation of workers were also points of contention.

With this in mind, I would like to recap the outstanding issues that might have affected the company’s relationship with CRUM. What were those issues? Well, as you know, we had a significant increase in unresolved defects over the last 3 months and our delivery and technical issues.
It is obvious that we can do more for our customers, which echoes the previous point about unresolved issues. Last quarter, we were able to resolve this due to cross-team collaboration and new delivery dates. This brings me to the next point: we have improved quality control and delivery processes. I´ll not dig into the changes but please take your time to review them and let us know any concerns regarding them. 
So, after examining how we addressed our first issue, I would like to share how we would address our poor response that we talked about at the beginning. Our goal remains to secure the support and resources of all our key players to help us continue to improve.

Write 150-200 words. Response: nan,"<input>Report on Recommended Training <code a=""MORPH"" c=""Provider"">Provides</code>: Skills Pro

Introduction
This report evaluates two training providers, TrainQuick and Skills Pro, and recommends the best option for our company’s training needs. While TrainQuick is cheaper and more flexible, Skills Pro offers higher quality and better outcomes.

Evaluation of Training Providers
TrainQuick provides affordable training with flexible scheduling. However, it has not been widely used in our other branch, and employees dislike mixed-branch training sessions. This could lead to low engagement and reduced effectiveness.

Skills Pro is more expensive, and some employees find the course content difficult. However, most participants complete the training successfully, indicating strong instructional quality. Additionally, Skills Pro plans to expand its course offerings, which could benefit us in the long run.

Recommendation
Despite the higher cost, Skills Pro is the better option. High-quality training leads to better employee performance, making it a worthwhile investment.

Conclusion
To ensure effective training and employee development, we should choose Skills Pro. The benefits outweigh the cost, making it the best choice for our company’s long-term success.</input>",28757296-8797-428f-a562-0b03c304b341,14.0,0,0,0,True,0.583,"{'Score 0': 0.583, 'Score 1': 0.3284, 'Score 2': 0.0741, 'Score 3': 0.0075, 'Score 4': 0.0036, 'Score 5': 0.0035}"

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Learning a new language is an exciting yet often difficult journey. Many students face challenges that can slow their progress or make them feel discouraged. One common issue is the fear of making mistakes, which can prevent learners from speaking or participating actively in class. This fear is often rooted in a desire to be perfect rather than focusing on communication.

Another major challenge is maintaining motivation. At first, learning a new language can feel fresh and rewarding. However, over time, students may feel stuck or frustrated when progress becomes less noticeable. To stay motivated, it helps to set small, realistic goals and celebrate each achievement.

Time management is also a critical challenge. Language learning requires consistent practice, but many students struggle to balance it with other responsibilities. Creating a study routine and integrating language into daily life—such as watching foreign-language shows or journaling—can help.

Lastly, exposure to real-life language use is limited in classroom settings. Without regular opportunities to practice with native speakers, students may struggle with listening and speaking skills. Seeking language exchange partners or online communities can make a significant difference.

In conclusion, while language learning is challenging, identifying these obstacles and addressing them with practical strategies can lead to steady progress and greater confidence.","<input>Learning a new language is an exciting yet often difficult journey.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: An airplane is made up of several key parts, each with its own important function. The fuselage is the central body of the airplane, where the cockpit, passengers, and cargo are located. It connects all the other parts of the airplane and provides structural support1.

The wings are attached to the fuselage and are the primary lift-generating surfaces. They house control surfaces like ailerons, flaps, and slats, which help control the airplane's movement12.

The tail, also known as the empennage, includes the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. These stabilizers provide stability and control, keeping the airplane flying straight. The horizontal stabilizer prevents up-and-down motion (pitch), while the vertical stabilizer prevents side-to-side motion (yaw)2.

Finally, the engines provide the thrust needed to push the airplane forward through the air. They can be turbine engines or propellers, depending on the type of airplane.

7.1. Subsequent to completion of the probationary term of employment referred to in paragraph 4 herein, Party A may terminate the employment of Party B at any time:

(a) for just cause at common law, in which case Party B is not entitled to any advance notice of termination or compensation in lieu of notice;

(b) without just cause, in which case Party A shall provide Party B with advance notice of termination or compensation in lieu of notice equal to 1 month plus 2 weeks per year of completed service with Party A, to a maximum of fifteen (15) months.

(c) Termination by Party A shall not be based on any discriminatory grounds including, but not limited to, race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, nationality, marital status, or any other protected characteristic under applicable law. Any termination that is found to be discriminatory shall be considered null and void, and may result in legal consequences for Party A.

7.2. Party B may terminate his employment at any time by providing Party A with at least eight (8) weeks advance notice of his intention to resign.

7.3. Party B shall not terminate employment for reasons of discrimination or harassment. Should Party B believe that such discrimination or harassment has occurred, Party B is encouraged to report the matter through appropriate internal or legal channels prior to resignation.

7.4. Both parties agree to comply with all applicable anti-discrimination laws and to promote a workplace free from discrimination and harassment.

### Comparison with the original model:

* **New clauses (7.1(c), 7.3, and 7.4)** explicitly address discrimination and harassment, ensuring no termination is based on discriminatory reasons.
* The original model did not mention discrimination protections.
* The amendment adds clear commitments to comply with anti-discrimination laws and offers protections for both employer and employee rights in case of discriminatory behavior.
* This change promotes fairness and legal compliance, helping to protect both parties and prevent unlawful termination.

</code>I believe e-nav tools should not completely replace traditional equipment on ships. While electronic navigation systems are faster and more accurate, they can fail due to software bugs, power issues, or cyberattacks. Traditional tools, like paper charts and compasses, are essential backups in emergencies. Additionally, relying only on technology may reduce sailors' manual skills over time. A balanced approach, where e-nav tools are used alongside traditional methods, ensures both efficiency and safety at sea.

</code>Parts of an Airplane

An airplane is made up of several important parts that work together to make it fly. The main part is the fuselage, which is the body of the airplane. It holds the cockpit, where the pilots sit, and the cabin, where passengers and cargo are placed. The wings are large surfaces attached to both sides of the fuselage. They are essential for flight because they create lift when the airplane moves through the air.

At the back of the airplane is the tail, also called the empennage. The tail helps keep the airplane stable and includes parts like the horizontal and vertical stabilizers, which control the plane’s direction and balance. Finally, the engines are usually located on the wings or the fuselage. They provide the thrust needed to push the airplane forward, allowing it to gain speed and lift off the ground.

All these parts work together to help the airplane fly safely and smoothly from one place to another.<code a=""PHRA"" c="""">

We understand there have been concerns regarding the stability of the construction business and rumors about our share prices potentially affecting your investments. We want to address these issues directly and reassure you of our strong position in the market.

Firstly, we want to stress that the rumors about our share prices are completely unfounded. While it is true that our share value experienced a drop two months ago, this was due to the resignation of our former CEO, Greg Johnson. Since then, we have welcomed Harry Levi as our new CEO.

</code>We understand there have been concerns regarding the stability of the construction business and rumors about our share prices potentially affecting your investments. We want to address these issues directly and reassure you of our strong position in the market.

Firstly, we want to stress that the rumors about our share prices are completely unfounded. While it is true that our share value experienced a drop two months ago, this was due to the resignation of our former CEO, Greg Johnson. Since then, we have welcomed Harry Levi as our new CEO. Harry is well-known and highly respected in the industry, and under his leadership, our share value has not only recovered but has also reached a historic high.

In this unstable market, we are committed to maintaining stability. We have secured three significant contracts for the coming three years, ensuring guaranteed profits and reinforcing our market position.

Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive?

Response: nan,"<input>Buying a home and applying for a home loan in the United States can be both exciting and challenging. The process involves several steps and quite a bit of paperwork.

Housing prices vary greatly depending on the location, but in general, housing has become more expensive in many areas, especially in big cities. <code a=""PHRA"" c="""">
</code>As of mid-2025, mortgage interest rates typically range from 6% to 7%, depending on your credit score and the type of loan. These rates are higher than a few years ago, which makes monthly payments more expensive.

While it's not legally required to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker, many people choose to work with them to make the process smoother.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: You are a journalist for a financial magazine. You've been asked by your editor to write a report on the performance of the Hang Seng (HSI) stock market index. You have some notes and a graph as your guide. Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. Response: Hang Seng Index

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index (HSI) has been steadily rising over the past six months, supported by investment from mainland China.

The index started to rise sharply a year ago, and over the next four months it rose sharply, before falling sharply to 20,956 points in two months. The index started a new rise six months ago, and today the index has been steadily rising, reaching 27,499 points.

Experts believe that the index will only rise next year, driven by both huge investments from other countries and domestic demand in Hong Kong.

Growth from China has led to an increase in the sub-indices of real estate and utilities.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your friend is about to open a secondhand clothes shop. He doesn’t have much capital, and is renting a very old building. He has got a few quotes for property and liability insurance, but they have been very high. He asks you to do a risk assessment of the premises. Have a look at your checklist, then write him an email advising him of the changes he has to make. Write 150-200 words. Response: Property and Liability Insurance Assessment 
Falling Bricks:
The primary hazard is the potential for loose bricks to fall, causing injury to people or damage to property.
Potential for Falling Objects:
Other falling objects, like debris from mortar or other materials associated with loose bricks, should also be considered.
Structural Integrity:
Loose bricks may indicate a broader structural issue, potentially increasing the risk of further damage. 
Severity:
Evaluate the potential impact of falling bricks, considering factors like:
Height of bricks: Higher bricks increase the potential for significant impact and injury.
Brick material: Bricks made of heavier materials pose a higher risk.
Location of bricks: Bricks located near pathways, windows, or open areas increase the likelihood of someone being struck.
Condition of bricks: Evaluate the looseness of the bricks and how long they have been loose.
Weather conditions: Evaluate the impact of wind, rain, and temperature on the bricks.
Structural integrity: If the wall has a history of issues, this increases the likelihood of falling bricks. 
Property Liability Insurance:
Property owners are often covered for liability claims if someone is injured on their property, including injuries caused by falling bricks. 
Duty of Care:
Owners have a duty to maintain their property and ensure it is safe for others. Failure to address loose bricks could lead to liability claims. 
Negligence:
If an owner knew or should have known about the loose bricks and failed to address them, they could be found liable for damages. 
Warning Signs:
If repairs are not feasible or immediate, warning signs can be used to alert people to the potential hazard.
Regular Inspections:
Regular inspections of the exterior can help identify and address loose bricks before they become a significant hazard.

Do you believe companies have a responsibility to society? Or do you think a company's only responsibility is to its shareholders? We invite you to join this discussion by posting your opinion on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Below are some quotes from recent submissions. We look forward to hearing from you!

For CSR

Companies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street. And it's the same with sustainable operations and fair employee benefits. The former secures future possibilities, and the latter ensures high productivity and low turnover.
– lil@213

The reason CSR makes good business sense, the reason it contributes to the bottom line, is because consumers care. Companies with a good CSR record are rewarded by customer loyalty. Consumers are happy, the company performs well and communities around the world benefit.
– Jack@MSU

As an integrated part of society, corporations need to conform to social expectations, and that entails helping the community.
– James.W@efstudent.com

Against CSR

The problem with corporate social responsibility is that corporations don't have social responsibility. Milton Friedman has pointed out that the real responsibility of business is to increase its profits; business is not answerable to society's expectations but to the shareholders'.
– theG8T

It's great that corporations are spending huge sums of money on development projects across the world, but these sums of money are usually still inconsiderable relative to total earnings. In this sense, it's still quite a cheap marketing device to buy a good public image.
– JackD_92

It's the government's job to make and enforce laws and regulations that will benefit the greater public. Corporations will need to conform to these regulations, but by no means should they be put in the driver's seat.

I was really sorry to hear about the stressful time you're having. It sounds like you're juggling a lot right now, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed.  Remember, you're not alone in this, and many people experience similar pressures.

First, let's break down the stress.  It's crucial to identify the specific sources – is it work, relationships, finances, or a combination?  Once you pinpoint the triggers, you can start to address them more effectively.  Try writing them down; sometimes just seeing them on paper can make them seem less daunting.

For work stress, consider setting realistic goals and prioritizing tasks. Don't be afraid to delegate or ask for help when needed.  For personal stress, make time for activities you enjoy – even if it's just for a short while.  Exercise, meditation, or even just a good book can work wonders.

Remember, it's okay to take breaks.  Don't feel guilty about taking time for yourself.  Even a few minutes of deep breathing or mindfulness can make a difference.  And most importantly, don't hesitate to reach out to a professional if you feel like you're struggling to cope.  Talking to someone can provide valuable perspective and support.

You're a strong person, and you'll get through this. Just remember to be kind to yourself, take things one step at a time, and don't be afraid to ask for help.

Many are seen as out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people due to their immense wealth and privileged lifestyles.

Additionally, their frequent endorsements of products or causes sometimes come off as insincere, driven more by financial gain than genuine concern. Celebrities are also prone to making controversial or thoughtless statements, which can have far-reaching consequences, yet their privilege often shields them from real accountability. The media frequently fuels their personal drama, turning their lives into entertainment, while ignoring more pressing societal issues.

Dear Shareholders,

I hope this message finds you well. We have recently become aware of concerns regarding the stability of Future Foundations Construction Company and rumors about our share prices. We want to address these concerns directly and provide clarity.

First and foremost, we want to stress our firm position: Future Foundations Construction Company is committed to maintaining stability in the market. The rumors about our share prices going down and wiping out investments are completely unfounded.

It is true that our share value experienced a drop two months ago. This was directly related to the resignation of our former CEO, Greg Johnson. However, since then, we have welcomed our new CEO, Harry Levi, who is well-known and highly respected in the industry. Under his leadership, our share value has not only recovered but has also quickly increased to a historic high.

To ensure continued stability in this unstable market, we have secured three significant contracts for the coming three years, guaranteeing substantial profits. This achievement underscores our solid foundation and forward-looking strategy.

We want to take this opportunity to thank you, our valued shareholders, for your loyalty and support. We are confident about the company's bright future and remain committed to delivering sustained growth and stability.

As part of our ongoing commitment to transparency and reassurance, we will soon share Future Foundations' comprehensive five-year roadmap with you.

Thank you once again for your trust and confidence in Future Foundations Construction Company.

Celebrities are often elevated to the status of untouchable idols, despite their flaws and shortcomings.

They use their platforms to promote unattainable lifestyles, often endorsing products or ideals that are superficial at best, and harmful at worst. The celebrity-driven narrative of perfection distorts the self-image of their audience, particularly younger generations who may feel pressure to emulate these unrealistic standards.

Additionally, the culture of celebrity worship distracts from more meaningful accomplishments and real-world issues. Instead of focusing on individuals who are genuinely making a difference in areas like science, social justice, or education, we choose to put the spotlight on people who have mastered the art of self-promotion. This not only perpetuates shallow values but also diverts attention from the hard work and dedication that truly deserves admiration. It's time we reassess who we choose to glorify and why.

Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: nan,"<input>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become a fundamental aspect of modern business practices, reflecting an organization’s commitment to ethical behavior, sustainable development, and the well-being of society. As businesses continue to recognize their influential role in the global landscape, CSR initiatives have emerged as a vital component for fostering trust and building a positive brand image.

One of the key arguments in favor of CSR is its potential to create shared value for both businesses and communities. By integrating social and environmental considerations into their operations, companies can drive innovation, reduce costs, and open new market opportunities. For instance, sustainable practices such as energy efficiency and waste reduction not only benefit the environment but also result in significant cost savings for businesses.

Moreover, CSR initiatives can enhance a company's reputation and strengthen its relationship with stakeholders, including customers, employees, and investors. Consumers today are increasingly inclined to support brands that align with their values, and a strong CSR strategy can serve as a powerful differentiator in a competitive market. Similarly, employees are more likely to feel motivated and loyal when they work for a company that demonstrates a genuine commitment to social and environmental issues.

However, it is crucial for companies to approach CSR authentically, avoiding superficial or insincere efforts commonly referred to as ""greenwashing."" Transparency and accountability should be at the forefront of any CSR strategy to ensure that businesses truly contribute to societal progress.

In conclusion, corporate social responsibility is not merely a philanthropic endeavor but a strategic approach that can drive sustainable business success while contributing positively to society. By embracing CSR, companies can play a pivotal role in addressing global challenges while securing their long-term growth and relevance.</input>",8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799,13.0,0,0,0,True,0.5884,"{'Score 0': 0.5884, 'Score 1': 0.3032, 'Score 2': 0.0726, 'Score 3': 0.0123, 'Score 4': 0.0102, 'Score 5': 0.0132}"

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: You are a life coach. It's your job to advise people on their lifestyle choices. You're in a consultation with a new client, Pete. Listen to him describe his lifestyle and take notes. Response: nan","<input>Subject: Let’s Take the First Steps Toward a Healthier You

Hi Pete,

Thank you for sharing your current lifestyle with me. It’s clear that you’re under a lot of pressure, and I admire your honesty. Now, let’s focus on small, realistic changes that can bring big results.

Your smoking habit is something we need to address first. Since stress at work makes you reach for cigarettes, finding healthier ways to cope—like deep breathing, walking, or short stretch breaks—could help. If you continue smoking, there’s a real risk of heart or lung disease. But quitting can greatly improve your breathing, energy, and life expectancy.

Long hours in front of the computer and an uncomfortable chair are causing your back pain and constant fatigue. Try setting a reminder to stand up and stretch every hour. Investing in an ergonomic chair can also make a big difference.

You mentioned drinking too much coffee. This leads to poor sleep, which affects your focus and mood. Reducing caffeine and improving your sleep routine will boost your mental clarity.

Finally, cutting down on junk food and moving more—even a short daily walk—will help you lose weight and feel better.

Step by step, these changes can lead you to a healthier, more balanced life.

All the best,

In Western folklore, they are typically seen as malevolent beings hoarding treasure, dwelling in caves or atop mountains, and challenging brave knights. The dragon's symbolism in the West often revolves around themes of chaos and destruction, representing a formidable force that heroes must conquer.

Conversely, in Eastern traditions, dragons are revered as benevolent and wise creatures. In Chinese mythology, dragons are associated with water and weather, controlling rainfall and rivers, and are considered symbols of power, strength, and good fortune.

Dragons are celebrated during festivals, such as the Dragon Boat Festival, where they are honored with vibrant rituals and races.

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: nan,"<input>Challenges in Language Learning
 
Learning a new language is an exciting yet challenging journey. Many students face difficulties that make the process frustrating at times. One major challenge is pronunciation. Some sounds in a new language may not exist in a learner’s native tongue, making them hard to produce correctly. This can lead to misunderstandings in conversations.
 
Another issue is vocabulary retention. Memorizing new words is not enough; learners need to use them regularly to truly remember them. Without practice, words are easily forgotten. Similarly, grammar rules can be overwhelming. Every language has its own structure, and making mistakes is common. Some learners feel discouraged when they struggle to form correct sentences.
 
Confidence and fear of making mistakes also hold many students back. Speaking in a new language can be intimidating, especially in front of native speakers. The fear of being judged often prevents learners from practicing, which slows down progress.
 
Lastly, consistency is key, but many students struggle to stay motivated. Without regular practice, improvement is slow. Finding engaging ways to learn—such as watching movies, speaking with native speakers, or using language apps—can make the process more enjoyable.
 
Despite these challenges, persistence and practice lead to success. Every mistake is part of the learning journey, and with time, confidence grows.</input>",43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a,15.0,0,0,0,True,0.5703,"{'Score 0': 0.5703, 'Score 1': 0.2949, 'Score 2': 0.0709, 'Score 3': 0.016, 'Score 4': 0.0184, 'Score 5': 0.0296}"

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become an integral part of modern business practices, reflecting a company's commitment to ethical behavior, sustainable development, and community engagement. The postings on this topic reveal a spectrum of opinions, ranging from enthusiastic support to skeptical criticism.

Proponents argue that CSR initiatives foster a positive public image, enhance customer loyalty, and attract top talent. Companies like Patagonia and Ben & Jerry's are often cited as exemplars, demonstrating that ethical practices can coexist with profitability. These businesses have successfully integrated environmental stewardship and social equity into their core operations, proving that CSR can be a win-win strategy for both the company and society.

Critics, however, contend that CSR is often a facade, a marketing gimmick designed to distract from less savory business practices. They point to instances where companies engage in ""greenwashing,"" promoting environmentally friendly initiatives while continuing harmful practices behind the scenes. This skepticism underscores the need for transparency and accountability in CSR efforts.

In my view, CSR is not just a moral imperative but a strategic necessity in today's interconnected world. Companies wield significant influence and resources, and with that comes the responsibility to contribute positively to society. Effective CSR requires genuine commitment, clear goals, and measurable outcomes. It should be embedded in the company's culture and operations, rather than being treated as an afterthought or a mere public relations tool.

Ultimately, the true measure of CSR's success lies in its impact. When done right, CSR can drive meaningful change, fostering a more sustainable and equitable world while also benefiting the business itself. Therefore, companies should strive to move beyond superficial gestures and embrace CSR as a core component of their identity and strategy.","<input>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become an integral part of modern business practices, reflecting a company's commitment to ethical behavior, sustainable development, and community engagement.

How about this one: 'There's no substitute for hard work.' – Thomas Edison It's a reminder that there really are no short cuts in our industry, and success only comes with hard work. Feel free to use your own quote, though. Show thanks to the staff for their hard work this year. They've done a lot of overtime to make sure our sales goals were met. Close the speech with another quote that'll motivate them. Here's one I suggest: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.' – Winston Churchill We've had some hard times this year, and although we've met our goals (barely), the staff will need some motivation to push harder next year. That quote is quite relevant, I think. Your speech is shaping up to be quite powerful! Here’s how you might weave all those elements together:   ","<input>Hi, <code a=""ORTH"" c=""earlier"">Earlier</code> you emailed me for some ideas on what to include in your speech.

"Prompt Level: 12.0 Prompt: Write about how to develop leadership qualities. You can write about personal experiences or what you have seen happen in others. What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. Response: Developing leadership qualities is a continuous journey that mixes self-awareness, practice, and adaptability. From personal experience, stepping into leadership roles, whether in group projects or professional settings, taught me that communication, empathy, and resilience are foundational. A leader must articulate a clear vision while actively listening to the perspectives from others, fostering trust and collaboration. Empathy to connect with team members, understand their challenges, and inspire motivation. Resilience to adapt and learn, surviving the inevitable setbacks, defining the leadership impact.

Observing others, I’ve noticed that the best leaders lead by example. They don’t weakness in front of hard work, admit mistakes openly, and prioritize team growth over personal glory. Confidence without arrogance, decisiveness balanced with humility, and a growth mindset are traits that stand out.

While not everyone aspires to lead, everyone has the potential to cultivate leadership qualities. It begins with taking initiative, embracing responsibility, and seeking feedback. Leadership isn’t about titles, it’s about influence and action. Even small acts of mentorship, problem-solving, or rallying others toward a shared goal reflect leadership. With intentional effort, anyone can hone these skills and inspire positive change, regardless of their natural inclinations.","<input>Developing leadership qualities is a continuous journey that mixes self-awareness, practice, and adaptability.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Among the introduced techniques, free writing and loop writing appear most useful. Free writing allows for a spontaneous and unfettered exploration of ideas, overcoming writer's block and fostering creativity. Loop writing builds upon this by providing a structured framework to refine and develop those initial ideas into coherent narratives. This combination of spontaneity and structure makes it a powerful tool for brainstorming and developing a piece of writing. 
Listing and questioning are also valuable, as they provide a means to organize thoughts and explore different facets of a topic. Listing helps in creating a comprehensive overview, while questioning encourages deeper reflection and analysis. These techniques are particularly helpful for organizing thoughts before drafting a piece and for ensuring that all relevant aspects of a topic are considered.

many different approaches of teaching these organizational and critical skills with freewriting. Peter Elbow and Lynn Hammond both use freewriting in their classes in similar manners. Elbow went through three bouts of teaching before settling on the style he uses today. The first bout occurred during his graduate year at M.I.T. where he ""simply tried to imitate the good teachers (he had) had—to be Socrates and a good guy at the same time"" (Embracing Contraries 67). After teaching in this manner for five years, he went through a ""why should I tell them anything if they don't ask me questions"" stage, in which he taught his classes (sophomore level) based on a three step system. First the students had to state on paper three times during the year what the expected to learn or what they had learned. Each student pursued his/her own goals with only constraints of reality to steer their learning. Second, all students read either a work of literature, or something about literature each week, and third, they all had to write something on paper and put it in a box where all the other students could read it and make comments (Contraries 71). This process sounds similar to our e-mail usage in 5360. Finally, after becoming fed up with the above two methods of teaching, Elbow embraced his first and second order thinking technique.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: nan","<input>In Kolkata, one of the most popular and legendary creatures in local folklore is the **Bhoot**, a ghostly figure that features prominently in the city's rich tradition of supernatural tales. The Bhoot is often described as the spirit of a person who has met an untimely or tragic death, unable to find peace and thus lingering in the physical world. In Bengali culture, these spirits are usually depicted as pale, ragged figures with hollow eyes, wandering aimlessly at night in search of vengeance or redemption.

The Bhoot's presence is often associated with eerie, dark corners of Kolkata, such as abandoned buildings, old neighborhoods, or even the banks of the Hooghly River. Kolkata’s dense fog and narrow, dimly lit alleys add to the chilling atmosphere that makes these legends come alive, particularly during festivals like **Poila Boishakh** (Bengali New Year) and **Durga Puja**, when the veil between the living and the dead is said to be <code a=""DET"" c=""the ""></code>thinnest.

In some variations of the story, the Bhoot is a mischievous entity, playing pranks on the living, while in others, it is more malevolent, causing fear and harm.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: Use the information in the notes to write an informative text about NAFTA, or write about a trade agreement your country is a part of. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a major trade pact between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. After lengthy negotiations, it officially came into effect in January 1994. Its main goal was to reduce or eliminate customs duties and other trade barriers between the three countries, thereby encouraging the free flow of goods and services across borders.

NAFTA has had a significant impact on trade relations, particularly in sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. For example, it allowed Mexican fruits and vegetables to enter the U.S. market more easily, benefiting both producers and consumers. It also helped integrate supply chains across North America, making industries more competitive globally.

However, the agreement has not been without controversy. While it created jobs and boosted exports in some regions, it also led to job losses and factory closures in others. Despite these challenges, NAFTA has generally been seen as beneficial for all three member countries, strengthening economic ties and promoting regional cooperation.","<input>The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a major trade pact between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your friend is about to open a secondhand clothes shop. He doesn’t have much capital, and is renting a very old building.

Have a look at your checklist, then write him an email advising him of the changes he has to make. Write 150-200 words. Response: Hi Garate,

I’ve completed the risk assessment for your secondhand clothes shop, and I can see why your insurance quotes have been high. There are several issues that need attention to reduce your risk and premiums.

Outside, there are loose bricks and blocked drainpipes that could cause accidents or water damage, so it’s important to repair these and clear them out. The leaky roof should also be fixed to prevent damage to your stock and the building. Keeping the yard and sidewalk clear of clutter will reduce the risk of slips and trips for customers.

Inside, poor lighting needs to be improved to prevent accidents and theft, and boxes should not be stacked unsafely as this can cause injuries. It’s essential to replace the old fire extinguishers with functioning ones and store loose chemicals properly to reduce fire hazards and health risks.

Making these changes will not only improve safety for your customers and staff but should also help lower your property and liability insurance costs.

Let me know if you need help prioritizing these tasks.

Thanks for opening up—it means a lot that you trust me. I’m really sorry to hear that you’ve been feeling overwhelmed lately. It sounds like you’re juggling a lot right now, and that can be exhausting.

One thing that might help is breaking things down into smaller, more manageable steps. Focus on what you can control, and try not to take everything on at once. Also, don’t be afraid to lean on others—friends, family, or even a counselor. You don’t have to go through this alone.

Make sure to carve out a little time just for you, even if it’s just 10 minutes a day. Sometimes, a short walk or a quiet moment can make a big difference.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: 
One legendary creature I find especially fascinating is the kitsune from Japanese folklore. Kitsune are supernatural foxes known for their intelligence, magical abilities, and shape-shifting powers. As they grow older—typically after a hundred years—they gain the power to transform into human form, often taking the shape of a beautiful woman, a wise man, or even a child. They are often portrayed as guardians, tricksters, or messengers of the Shinto deity Inari.

Kitsune are deeply tied to themes of duality: wisdom and mischief, protection and deception. Some legends tell of kitsune marrying humans and living peaceful lives, while others describe them playing elaborate pranks or causing chaos. One of the most intriguing aspects of the kitsune myth is the belief that they possess multiple tails—up to nine. The more tails a kitsune has, the more powerful and ancient it is.

The kitsune remains a popular figure in modern Japanese culture, appearing in literature, anime, and festivals. Its blend of mystery, beauty, and magic makes it a timeless and captivating creature in the world of legends.

Hey Sam,

I have to tell you about the weirdest (but kinda funny) thing that happened to me yesterday. So, I was at that little café on Maple Street — you know, the one with the amazing cinnamon rolls. I ordered my coffee and sat by the window, minding my own business, when suddenly… a squirrel ran inside the café!

At first, everyone just froze. It stood on the counter like it owned the place, staring at us with those little beady eyes. Then, chaos. It jumped onto a woman’s table, knocked her muffin onto the floor, and dashed under the chairs. The barista tried to chase it with a broom, but the squirrel was way too fast. People were laughing, some were screaming, and one guy even tried to film it, but the squirrel knocked his phone off the table!

Eventually, it dashed out the door, leaving behind a trail of crumbs and confused customers. Honestly, it was the most exciting coffee run I’ve ever had. Wish you’d been there — you’d have lost it laughing!

Talk soon,
Jess

At first, everyone just froze. It stood on the counter like it owned the place, staring at us with those little beady eyes. Then, chaos. It jumped onto a woman’s table, knocked her muffin onto the floor, and dashed under the chairs. The barista tried to chase it with a broom, but the squirrel was way too fast. People were laughing, some were screaming, and one guy even tried to film it, but the squirrel knocked his phone off the table!

Eventually, it dashed out the door, leaving behind a trail of crumbs and confused customers. Honestly, it was the most exciting coffee run I’ve ever had. Wish you’d been there<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code>—<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code>you’d have lost it laughing!

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to update you on some key priorities and ongoing initiatives.

First, our work on the US client designs remains a high priority. The client has expressed interest in working with us again if we continue to perform well, so it is crucial that we stay on track. While progress has been slower than expected, we are still on the right path. Keep up the great work!

In addition, we have two staff members leaving in Q2, and we need to find suitable replacements. If any of you know of potential candidates or have recommendations, please feel free to reach out to me.

Lastly, regarding the marketing media reorganization, the project is currently on hold. It’s been a bit messy, and there<code a=""VERB:TENSE"" c="" has"">’s</code> been minimal use of the old media. We are taking a step back for now and will revisit it when the time is right.

Response: Three months ago, our collaboration with Crum encountered a few hurdles due to unresolved product defects and additional technical challenges. These issues threatened the integrity of our service and strained client trust. Acknowledging the severity of the situation, we took swift action to refine our processes and restore confidence.
Our first step was to overhaul the way we delivered updates, ensuring they were more stable and better timed to customer needs. Additionally, we enhanced our Quality Assurance protocols, tightening controls and implementing more rigorous testing to catch defects earlier in the development cycle. These improvements have already had a positive impact on the performance and reliability of our offerings.
Thanks to these efforts, we are proud to share that our partnership with Crum has been renewed. Even more gratifying, Crum commended us for our unwavering dedication to quality—a testament to the progress we've made.

In contrast, Mumbai, the financial capital, is a bustling metropolis that never sleeps, characterized by its fast-paced lifestyle and vibrant nightlife.

In Chennai (X), the pace of life is relatively relaxed. The city is famous for its classical music and dance, with numerous cultural festivals held throughout the year. Marina Beach, one of the longest urban beaches in the world, provides a tranquil escape from the city's hustle and bustle. Chennai's cuisine, particularly its South Indian dishes like dosa and idli, is a culinary delight.

Mumbai (Y), on the other hand, is a city of dreams and opportunities. The city is home to Bollywood, India's thriving film industry, and attracts people from all over the country seeking fame and fortune. Landmarks like the Gateway of India and Marine Drive are iconic symbols of Mumbai's vibrant spirit. The city's street food, including vada pav and pav bhaji, is a must-try for any visitor.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: s mentioned above, the configuration of the aircraft illustrated has been chosen only by way of example. Individual aircraft can be configured very differently from this airliner. The Wright brothers' Flyer 1903 had propellers and elevators at the front of the aircraft. Fighter aircraft often have the engines buried inside the fuselage instead of placing them in nacelles suspended under the wings. Many fighter aircraft also combine the horizontal stabilizer and elevator into a single stabilizer surface. There are many possible aircraft configurations, but any configuration must include the four forces required for flight. The wings have additional rear sections hinged close to the body, called flaps. The flaps are deployed downward on takeoff and landing to increase the amount of force produced by the wing. On some aircraft, the forward part of the wing also deforms. The slats are used during takeoff and landing to produce additional force. Spoilers are also used during landing to slow down the aircraft and to counter flaps when the aircraft is on the ground.

Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive?

Response: nan,"<input>Buying a home in <code a=""PHRA"" c=""my country"">India</code> is a significant milestone and involves several steps. Here's a brief guide to help you navigate the process:

1. **Determine Your Budget**: Assess your financial situation to determine how much you can afford. Consider your savings, monthly income, and existing liabilities. It's crucial to have a clear budget to avoid overextending yourself.

2. **Choose the Right Property**: Research various locations and types of properties. Consider factors like proximity to work, schools, and amenities. Visit multiple properties to compare and find the one that best suits your needs.

3. **Check Legal Aspects**: Ensure the property has clear titles and is free from legal disputes. Verify all necessary approvals from local authorities. It's advisable to consult a legal expert to review the documents.

4. **Apply for a Home Loan**: Once you've selected a property, approach banks or financial institutions for a home loan. Compare interest rates, loan tenure, and other terms. Gather necessary documents like identity proof, address proof, income proof, and property documents.

5. **Loan Approval and Disbursement**: After submitting your application, the bank will evaluate your creditworthiness and the property's value. If approved, you'll receive a sanction letter detailing the loan amount, interest rate, and terms. Upon acceptance, the bank will disburse the loan amount to the seller.

6. **Registration and Possession**: Complete the property registration process by paying the stamp duty and registration fees. Once registered, you can take possession of your new home.

Buying a home is a complex process, but with careful planning and due diligence, you can make it a smooth and rewarding experience<code a=""PHRA"" c="".

Nagas are often depicted as half-human, half-serpent, and are believed to inhabit the underworld, as well as bodies of water like rivers, lakes, and seas.<code a=""ORTH"" c="" ""></code>

In Hindu and Buddhist traditions, Nagas are considered powerful and wise beings. They are often associated with water and fertility, and are believed to control the rain and rivers. Some stories portray them as protectors of treasures and sacred places, while others depict them as dangerous and vengeful if provoked.

One of the most famous Nagas is Shesha, also known as Ananta, who is said to be the king of all Nagas. Shesha is often depicted as a massive serpent with multiple heads, serving as the bed for the god Vishnu during his cosmic slumber. Another well-known Naga is Manasa, the goddess of snakes, worshipped for protection from snake bites and for fertility.

The Naga's dual nature as both benevolent and malevolent makes them a complex and intriguing figure in Indian mythology, embodying the balance between creation and destruction.<code a=""PHRA"" c="""">

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your friend is about to open a secondhand clothes shop. He doesn’t have much capital, and is renting a very old building. He has got a few quotes for property and liability insurance, but they have been very high. He asks you to do a risk assessment of the premises. Have a look at your checklist, then write him an email advising him of the changes he has to make. Write 150-200 words. Response: Hi Friend,

I’ve gone through the risk assessment for your secondhand clothes shop, and based on the checklist, here are a few changes you can make to help lower your property and liability insurance premiums.

Building Condition: Since the building is old, it might be increasing your premiums. Consider investing in some basic repairs, especially for plumbing and electrical systems. Insurance companies often view buildings with outdated infrastructure as higher risks.

Security: Installing security systems like an alarm, CCTV, and better locks will lower the risk of theft and vandalism. Many insurers offer discounts for properties with enhanced security measures.

Fire Safety: Adding fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, and possibly sprinklers could help reduce the risk of fire-related claims. These improvements may also make your insurance premiums more manageable.

Liability Coverage: Since the building is older, consider limiting your liability coverage to match the size and layout of the premises. If possible, raise your deductible to reduce premiums.

Let me know if you need help coordinating any of these changes!

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: nan","<input>Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find that **questioning** and **focused free writing** are the most useful to me. Questioning, for instance, helps me explore ideas more deeply and consider different perspectives before I even start writing. By asking ""why,"" ""how,"" and ""what if,"" I can challenge assumptions and generate more nuanced thoughts that lead to more thoughtful, engaging writing. It also aids in narrowing down a topic, ensuring I stay focused on key points throughout the piece.

**Focused free writing** also resonates with me because it allows for creativity without the pressure of perfection. It enables me to express my thoughts freely, bypassing any writer's block or self-criticism. The key is to write continuously, focusing on a specific topic, which often leads to unexpected insights and new angles on the subject. By combining this with questioning, I can refine my initial ideas and expand on them in a meaningful way. Both techniques seem especially valuable for brainstorming and developing ideas before moving on to a more structured approach in writing.</input>",81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541,16.0,0,0,0,True,0.5186,"{'Score 0': 0.5186, 'Score 1': 0.2678, 'Score 2': 0.0834, 'Score 3': 0.0289, 'Score 4': 0.0381, 'Score 5': 0.063}"

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a fascinating and crucial topic. I believe companies absolutely have a responsibility to society. Their actions shape economies, influence cultures, and impact the environment. In many ways, they hold significant power to drive progress and address societal challenges.

Ethical business practices, such as providing fair working conditions, prioritizing sustainability, and contributing to communities, are more than just nice gestures—they can create real, positive change. When companies embrace their social responsibilities, they don’t just enhance their own credibility—they foster trust, goodwill, and meaningful connections with stakeholders, including employees, customers, and communities.

At the same time, corporate responsibility isn’t just about avoiding harm; it’s about actively creating value. Businesses thrive when society thrives, so this interconnectedness makes their responsibility to society not only ethical but strategic as well.

CSR can manifest in many ways: environmentally sustainable initiatives, charitable contributions, fostering employee well-being, and supporting communities. Companies embracing CSR often see benefits such as improved brand reputation, stronger customer loyalty, and increased employee satisfaction. It is a win-win, contributing to society while strengthening the business.

However, CSR also has challenges. Sometimes, it is criticized as “greenwashing” when companies prioritize appearing socially responsible over genuinely making a difference. Authenticity and transparency are key to ensuring CSR initiatives truly deliver on their promises.

Dear Dave,

I’ve reviewed the premises for your shop, and while it’s a great location, several issues need addressing to lower your insurance premiums and improve safety. Here's what I recommend:

Exterior:

Loose bricks and blocked drainpipes: Fix these as soon as possible. They pose a hazard to customers and could lead to claims if accidents occur.

Cluttered sidewalk and untidy yard: Clear these areas to reduce the risk of trips and falls, which are common liability concerns.

Leaky roof: Repair it to prevent water damage to your stock and potential property claims.

Interior:

Stacked boxes: Organize and secure them properly to avoid accidents and fire hazards.

Old fire extinguishers: Replace these immediately to ensure compliance with fire safety regulations.

Loose chemicals: Store them securely to eliminate the risk of spills or contamination.

While addressing these issues may involve some upfront costs, it should help lower your insurance premiums and create a safer, more inviting space for your customers. Let me know if you need help prioritizing the fixes!

Method:
Surveys were conducted in Rio de Janeiro and Shanghai, with 1,000 participants in each location. The sample included a wide demographic range, and participants were asked <code a=""PREP"" c=""about"">for</code> their opinions on the collarless dress shirt.

Findings:
In Rio, only 35% approved of the shirt, and just 20% would buy it. In contrast, Shanghai showed stronger interest, with 80% approval and 40% likely to purchase. Key issues for those who disapproved included the design, size, color, and material.

Conclusions:
Overall interest was higher in Shanghai, suggesting regional acceptance varies significantly. Respondents felt the product lacked diversity in design and was poorly executed despite a good concept.

Recommendations:
Further market research is needed, especially in Rio. Product improvements should include slim-fit sizing, better material (e.g., wrinkle-free, sweat-absorbent), strong color options, and detailed design elements like stitching. Prioritizing changes for the Rio market is advised, as the response in Asia was more positive.<code a=""PHRA"" c="""">

Response: nan,"<input>Language students face a variety of issues and challenges that can hinder their learning progress. One of the primary obstacles is the difficulty of mastering pronunciation and grammar, especially when these differ significantly from their native language. This can lead to frustration and self-doubt, making it harder for students to stay motivated. Additionally, the lack of regular practice opportunities outside the classroom can result in limited language retention and fluency.

Cultural differences also pose a challenge, as understanding idiomatic expressions, social norms, and context-dependent meanings often requires more than just linguistic knowledge. These subtleties can make effective communication feel daunting for learners. Furthermore, language students may encounter a fear of making mistakes, which discourages them from speaking or participating actively.

Access to resources is another issue, as not all students have equal opportunities to engage with native speakers, language software, or immersive environments. Overcoming these challenges requires patience, support, and consistent practice to build confidence and competence.</input>",43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a,15.0,0,0,0,True,0.575,"{'Score 0': 0.5752, 'Score 1': 0.2988, 'Score 2': 0.0722, 'Score 3': 0.0146, 'Score 4': 0.015, 'Score 5': 0.0239}"

Hey Pedro Lucas,

You won’t believe what happened on Flight 293. Right after takeoff, we got a fault warning for the nose gear shock absorber. After a flyby at San Jose, we confirmed the nose wheels were stuck 90° left. We diverted to SFO for its longer runway and better emergency support. Landed without reverse thrust—tires blew out and shredded, but we stayed on centerline. No fire, just burnt rubber. Everyone deplaned safely. Wild day, but solid teamwork.

I'm really sorry to hear about the tough week you've been having. It sounds like a lot to handle at once. Regarding work, it might be helpful to have a candid conversation with your manager about how you're feeling. Sometimes, management isn't aware of how their actions affect the team, and bringing it to their attention could lead to positive changes. Alternatively, consider whether there are opportunities to seek roles elsewhere that might offer a more supportive environment.

As for your situation with Tia, relationships can be challenging, especially when expectations don't align. It might be worth having an open discussion with her about how you both feel and what you both want moving forward. Sometimes, clarity can help in deciding whether to work through issues or to amicably part ways.

Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed, and reaching out for support is a strong step. If you ever need to talk, I'm here for you. You might also consider speaking with a counselor, who can offer professional guidance.

Take care,

The Chicago Seven Verdict
The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.

In the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.

During the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.","<input><code a=""PHRA"" c="""">

Tori Spelling as Sidney Prescott, Luke Wilson as Billy Loomis, Heather Graham as Casey Becker

It was filmed in small towns in the United States to give it a creepy and familiar atmosphere.

</code>First of all, you<code a=""CONTR"" c=""’re"">'re</code> working too hard and, as a consequence, suffering from stress.

Write 150-200 words. Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a significant trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which came into force in January 1994 after years of negotiation. One of the most notable aspects of NAFTA is the reduction or elimination of customs duties among its member states, facilitating the free flow of goods and services across North America. This liberalization of trade has had a profound impact on trade relations, particularly in the agriculture sector. Mexican fruits and vegetables, for instance, have become a common sight in US markets, benefiting both consumers and producers.

While NAFTA has brought numerous benefits to all three member states, it has also created challenges. The agreement has been credited with fostering economic growth and increasing market access, but it has also been criticized for job losses in certain industries and wage disparities.

In As You Like It by William Shakespeare, the speaker compares the world to a stage, and people to players. 
""America is a melting pot""
John de Crevecoeur used this metaphor to describe the fusion of nationalities in the United States. 
""The fog comes on little cat feet""
In Carl Sandburg's poem ""Fog"", the speaker compares fog to a cat to show how fog acts aloof, silently invades towns, and creates a sense of mystery. 
""A wolf in sheep's clothing""
In the Bible, this metaphor is used to describe how people present themselves to others.

Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: You are preparing to brief your troops about the unit’s deployment. Read the information again and make notes on the main points. Type into the input box. Compare your notes with the model text at the end. Response: nan,"<input>The situation in the Federation of Pantasia began to cause <code a=""DET"" c="""">the </code>international <code a=""NOUN"" c="""">community </code>concern a year ago when an election resulted in a vote to break up the federation and form two separate countries for its two main ethnic groups, the Alphas and the Betas. Fighting broke out for control of the mineral-rich Argos Region, as well as between certain minority groups who were made refugees. There is also evidence of an attempt at ethnic cleansing of a minority group.

Six months ago<code a=""PUNCT"" c="", ""></code>the military staged a coup to reunite the Federation. Although a large portion of the armed forces have returned to Federal control, elements have remained loyal to the new governments of Alpha and Beta. These armies have had small battles between themselves over disputed territories while resisting operations by the Federal forces based in Federal Territory.

Until a month ago<code a=""PUNCT"" c="", ""></code>the situation was a stalemate<code a=""PUNCT"" c="";"">,</code> however, the various factions have been rearming under the <code a=""NOUN"" c=""pretense"">pretence</code> of negotiations. Recently, strong leadership in Beta has resulted in a campaign that has pinned down Federal forces and Beta forces have also launched an all-out attack through Alpha territory to seize valuable land in Argos.

This has resulted in considerable civilian casualties, refugees<code a=""PUNCT"" c="", ""></code>and dislocation of population. There are reports of executions, rape, destruction of property and infrastructure. It is also believed that Beta has established concentration camps as part of its ethnic cleansing policy.

Apart from the problems of the ongoing conflicts, there has been the constant threat of hunger for the civilians in the area. <code a=""PHRA"" c=""""> </code>Earlier in the year<code a=""PUNCT"" c="", ""></code>the weather was unusually cold and dry, which resulted in crop failures. In recent weeks<code a=""PUNCT"" c="", ""></code>heavy rains have caused flooding and the destruction of bridges, roads<code a=""PUNCT"" c="", ""></code>and rail links, cutting off some of the most vulnerable villages.

As a result of the conflict and because of humanitarian concerns, Chapter VII of the UN Charter was invoked by a special resolution with strong rules of engagement <code a=""PHRA"" c="""">(ROE) </code>to impose peace, separate the warring factions<code a=""PUNCT"" c="", ""></code>and provide humanitarian care. An Implementation Phase, involving air power supported by ground troops, will be launched at 0600 hours on Monday unless the factions lay down their arms. This seems increasingly unlikely.

In addition to war-fighting<code a=""PUNCT"" c="", ""></code>the infantry units will be expected to conduct humanitarian operations, to protect people and improve basic facilities. The Implementation Phase is expected to last one month and then turn into a Stabilization Phase, although it is possible that the war<code a=""PUNCT"" c=""-""></code>fighting phase will last longer. During the Stabilization Phase, infantry units will be ensuring peace and security while a new government takes over and NGOs enter the country to assist the civilian population. Some units will also be involved in direct<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code><code a=""PHRA"" c="""">humanitarian work.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: You are a journalist for a financial magazine. You've been asked by your editor to write a report on the performance of the Hang Seng (HSI) stock market index. You have some notes and a graph as your guide. Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. Response: Hang Seng Index Rebounds on Strong Mainland Investment:
The Hang Seng Index (HSI), Hong Kong’s benchmark stock market indicator, has shown robust performance over the past six months, rebounding strongly from earlier losses. After dipping to a low of 20,956, the HSI surged to a high of 27,499. This upward momentum has been largely driven by a wave of investment from Mainland China, particularly into Hong Kong’s property and utilities sectors. Sub-indices for both sectors recorded dramatic gains, reflecting increased confidence and capital inflows. Market analysts suggest this trend is just the beginning. With further foreign investment anticipated and a resurgence in domestic consumption, many believe the HSI will continue to climb in the coming year. “Hong Kong is regaining its appeal as a financial gateway to China,” noted one analyst. “As global investors regain confidence, we’re likely to see sustained growth in the index.”","<input>Hang Seng Index Rebounds on Strong Mainland Investment:

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a criticism of a celebrity. It can be a particular celebrity or the whole idea of celebrity in general. Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: In today’s media-driven world, the concept of celebrity often prioritizes visibility over real contribution. A striking example is Brazil’s influencer culture, where figures like Carlinhos Maia command millions of followers despite offering little in terms of cultural, scientific, or social value. His extravagant lifestyle, endless self-promotion, and controversial behavior reflect a growing trend: fame detached from substance.

While such personalities can entertain, their massive influence raises concerns. Young audiences, for instance, may equate success with online popularity rather than education, effort, or ethical behavior. This can distort aspirations and values. Moreover, these celebrities often monetize intimate aspects of their lives, promoting superficial ideals of beauty, consumption, and status.

Unlike artists, scientists, or educators who contribute meaningfully to society, many digital celebrities thrive on controversy and sensationalism. This not only lowers the bar for public discourse but also diverts attention from people doing valuable, yet less glamorous, work.

To build a more thoughtful society, Brazil must reconsider who we choose to admire. By celebrating individuals for their integrity, talent, and social impact — rather than just their follower count — we can inspire future generations to value depth over display.

I’d like to begin by highlighting one of the key achievements this quarter — the renewal of our partnership with Crum. This wasn’t just a routine agreement; the organization specifically praised our dedication to quality, which reflects the collective effort behind our work.

That said, this success didn’t come without its challenges. Just three months ago, we were dealing with unresolved defects that put our client relationships at risk. On top of that, there were several minor technical issues that added complexity.

To overcome these obstacles, we introduced two major changes. First, the update delivery process was revised. Second, Quality Assurance procedures were strengthened. These improvements wouldn’t have been possible without strong collaboration across teams — something I believe all of us can be proud of.

Looking ahead, we’re committed to providing even more proactive support to prevent similar issues and ensure continued satisfaction for this partner and others we work with.

I’ve been thinking about your situation and have a third option that might strike a balance between staying downtown and moving to a new model. How about opening a pop-up showroom in a high-traffic area of Centerville? This way, you can maintain a presence in the fashionable district without committing to a long-term lease at the current high rent.

Here’s the plan:
Pop-Up Showroom: Rent a smaller, more affordable space in a busy area for a few months at a time. This will allow you to showcase your clothing, meet customers, and take measurements without the high overhead costs.

Mobile Service: Continue with the idea of meeting customers at their offices or schools for measurements. This personalized service can be a unique selling point.

Enhanced Online Presence: Invest in a top-notch website where customers can view your clothing options, enter their measurements, and even schedule appointments for fittings.

This approach combines the benefits of having a physical presence in a prime location with the cost savings and flexibility of a mobile and online model. It also allows you to test different locations and see where you get the most foot traffic and sales.

Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: You work in the pharmaceutical industry. Your boss has asked you to summarize an article for him so that he can better talk in English about the major players in the industry. Summarize the article. Write 150-200 words. Response: nan,"<input>The pharmaceutical industry is largely concentrated in developed regions<code a=""PUNCT"" c="" "">, </code>such as the U.S., Europe, and Japan, characterized by complex regulatory frameworks and ongoing consolidation among major companies. This consolidation is primarily driven by the need for economies of scale and the increasing investment in research and development (R&D) to innovate and compete effectively.

Key players include GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), established in 2000 from the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. Headquartered in the U.K. with operations centered in the U.S., GSK employs over 90,000 people and holds an estimated 7% of the global pharmaceutical market. The company focuses on four therapeutic areas: anti-infectives, central nervous system, respiratory, and gastro-metabolic, with notable products such as Paxil for depression and Advair for asthma. GSK also has a strong presence in vaccines and oncology.

Another major company is Pfizer, one of the largest pharmaceutical firms globally, which acquired Warner-Lambert in 2000. Pfizer operates across human, animal health, and consumer healthcare segments, marketing well-known brands like Listerine and Sudafed. Merck & Co. is also a significant player, emphasizing research-driven health solutions and collaborating with Sanofi-Aventis to enhance its animal medication offerings and managed care services.</input>",fc1b0754-a143-4181-840a-0f045bd66fb8,7.0,0,0,0,True,0.5923,"{'Score 0': 0.5923, 'Score 1': 0.3367, 'Score 2': 0.0645, 'Score 3': 0.0039, 'Score 4': 0.0015, 'Score 5': 0.0014}"

While both car designs have their merits, I strongly recommend going with the Xz3 model for next year’s rollout for the following reasons: The Xz3’s higher acceleration and top speed make it a standout performer, catering to enthusiasts and those seeking high-performance vehicles. Consumers often prioritize speed and power in high-end car markets. The Xz3’s specifications align with these demands, likely resulting in higher sales and greater market penetration.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: You see a niche in the hotel market and decide to write a business proposal for investors.

Job name: Zen Boutique Hotel & Spa, and Health & Fitness Center 

Proposed by: Ferreira Studio Inc. 

Contact: Jorge Ferreira, Creative Manager (jorge.ferreira@ferreira-studio.com) 

Ferreira Studio hereby proposes the design and construction of the Zen Boutique Hotel & Spa, and Health & Fitness Center on Fake Street, CA. The center will provide first-level hotel and spa services as well as gym, health and fitness services. The estimated cost of the project is $37 million. 

Strategic summary 

AccomData Group, which we hired to conduct market research, reported that this project had found a niche in growing trends in weekend getaways to relaxing resorts, greater attention to healthy lifestyle. Their surveys revealed that our target customers, young professionals aged 25 to 40, are unsatisfied with the cuisine in most fitness centers. They highly value healthy menus with top chefs from renowned restaurants. Additionally, they are also attracted to the idea of having fully equipped gyms and swimming pools with trained instructors. 

The construction time is estimated in 2 years. We forecast an almost immediate return on your investment. By the end of Year 2, the forecasted revenue will have a surplus of $1 million, with profits rising to $6 million a year by Year 5. We guarantee that within four years, Capet's Capital will have recouped its investment and start realizing a profit after five years. 

Risk assessment 

Using a reputable insurance company to compile a risk assessment analysis, we've factored any possible economic downturn into our forecasted revenues and profits. If the economy remains stable, the period required for recouping investment and realizing profits could be cut in half. 

We've already engaged Kudos Advertising Agency, who have planned and designed thorough media and advertising coverage. An intensive campaign has been organized to start six months before our grand opening event. ","<input>Proposal submitted to: Martin Sanabria, Sanabria’s Capital

I wanted to give you a quick overview of the speech I’ll be delivering at the upcoming team session. It will focus on the recent renewal of our partnership with Crum—framing it not just as a business win, but as a reflection of our team’s resilience and commitment to quality. I’ll also highlight the positive feedback we received from Crum about our dedication, which I think is an important moment of recognition for everyone.

To provide context, I’ll briefly mention the challenges we faced three months ago—particularly the unresolved defects and other technical hurdles—and then shift toward how we responded. I’ll emphasize the steps we took, like changing how we deliver updates and strengthening our QA processes, showing that we took action and followed through.

I plan to close by reinforcing our future focus: continuing to improve support and anticipating customer needs to prevent recurrence. The tone will be candid but forward-looking, with the goal of building confidence and rallying the team around our progress.

Let me know if there’s anything you’d like me to adjust or emphasize.

The defendant argued that he believed the house was empty, was scared, and only sought temporary shelter. However, it was confirmed that Medina ransacked various areas of the home, intensifying the sense of threat experienced by the family. The court ruled that Medina’s actions constituted criminal trespassing. As a result, he was fined 1,000 monetary units, to be paid in two installments—one immediately. Additionally, the court sentenced Medina to 300 hours of community service. The verdict underscores the seriousness of unlawful entry, even when no physical harm is caused, especially when it results in emotional trauma to the occupants.

Additionally, the court sentenced Medina to 300 hours of community service. The verdict underscores the seriousness of unlawful entry, even when no physical harm is caused, especially when it results in emotional trauma to the occupants.<code a=""ORTH"" c="" ""></code>

Dear Harry,
 
Welcome to the team!<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code><code a=""PHRA"" c=""
 
""></code>Managing and motivating employees effectively is key to building a productive and engaged workforce. Here are some strategies to help you:
 
First, incentivize your employees. When they see that their hard work leads to recognition or rewards, they will be more motivated. Also, take an active interest in their career growth by offering mentorship and training opportunities. A team that feels supported is more likely to stay engaged. Additionally, promote a healthy work-life balance. Employees who feel respected and valued beyond their work contributions will perform better. Most importantly, listen to them. When employees feel heard, even when raising concerns, they develop a stronger sense of loyalty and trust.
 
On the other hand, avoid behaviors that can demotivate your team. Never take credit for their work, as this diminishes morale. Disrespecting or unfairly blaming employees will only create resentment. Losing your temper can make the workplace stressful, reducing productivity. Finally, always recognize and appreciate good work—it goes a long way in keeping employees motivated.
 
By fostering a positive and respectful work environment, you can build a high-performing team. Wishing you success in your new role!

Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: nan,"<input>Corporate Social Responsibility: A Necessity, Not a Choice

In today’s world, I believe corporate social responsibility (CSR) is no longer just a bonus—it’s a necessity. Companies are not isolated from society; they are part of it and have a duty to contribute positively.

First of all, CSR helps businesses build trust with consumers. In an age where people are more aware of environmental and social issues, companies that take responsibility for their impact tend to gain more loyalty. For example, brands that use sustainable packaging or support social causes often stand out from their competitors.

Secondly, CSR benefits employees and the company itself. When workers feel that their employer is ethical and socially aware, they are often more motivated and loyal. This leads to higher productivity and lower turnover, which saves the company money in the long run.

Some argue that CSR takes focus away from profit. However, I would argue that responsible practices and profit are not opposites. A company can do good and still do well financially—especially since today’s consumers often reward ethical behavior.

In conclusion, CSR is not about giving money away or looking good—it’s about doing business in a way that respects people and the planet. Companies that embrace this responsibility will not only help society but also ensure their own long-term success.</input>",8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799,13.0,0,0,0,True,0.5845,"{'Score 0': 0.5845, 'Score 1': 0.303, 'Score 2': 0.0724, 'Score 3': 0.0124, 'Score 4': 0.0114, 'Score 5': 0.0163}"

Students often face difficulties such as pronunciation, vocabulary retention, grammar rules, and conversational fluency.
Pronunciation can be tricky, especially when a language has unfamiliar sounds. English learners struggle with ""th,"" while French students find nasal vowels challenging. Without regular practice, mastering these sounds is difficult.
Another obstacle is vocabulary retention. Learning new words is easy, but remembering them long-term requires effort. Flashcards, repetition, and using words in daily conversations can help.
Grammar rules present another challenge. Many languages have complex structures, irregular verbs, and exceptions. For example, English has unpredictable spelling rules, while German’s gendered nouns can be confusing. Breaking grammar into small sections and practicing daily makes learning manageable.
Conversational fluency is often the biggest hurdle. Many students fear making mistakes, which hinders progress. Speaking regularly with native speakers and thinking in the target language builds confidence.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: Use the information in the notes to write an informative text about NAFTA, or write about a trade agreement your country is a part of. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: NAFTA: A Detailed Look at North American Trade
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a groundbreaking accord between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, officially coming into force in January 1994. The culmination of years of intricate negotiations, NAFTA's primary goal was to dramatically reduce or completely eliminate customs duties among its three member states. This initiative aimed to foster a more integrated and fluid economic environment across North America.
NAFTA's impact was far-reaching, profoundly reshaping trade relations, particularly within the agricultural sector. A notable example of this transformation was the significant increase in the flow of Mexican fruits and vegetables into the US market. Beyond agriculture, the agreement influenced various industries by removing trade barriers, which theoretically made goods and services cheaper and more accessible across borders.
While NAFTA generated both positive and negative impacts for each of the participating countries, the general consensus among economists and policymakers is that, overall, it benefited all three members. It spurred economic growth, increased trade volumes, and led to greater specialization in production among the nations. However, it also faced criticism, particularly concerning job displacement in certain sectors and environmental concerns. Despite these debates, NAFTA served as the cornerstone of North American trade policy for over two decades until it was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2020, marking a new chapter in regional economic cooperation.
Would you like to know more about the specific impacts of NAFTA on any of the member countries, or perhaps about the USMCA that replaced it?

Welcome aboard! Leading a team can be incredibly rewarding, and motivating your team effectively is key to success.

Here are a few strategies that work well:

Recognize and reward achievements, both big and small. A simple “thank you” or public acknowledgment can go a long way.
Support professional growth by offering training opportunities and encouraging development plans.
Foster open communication. Make time to listen to your team’s ideas and concerns.
Promote work-life balance. Respect personal time and encourage healthy boundaries.
Lead by example. Show integrity, humility, and respect in all interactions.<code a=""PHRA"" c=""

"">
</code>And here are some common pitfalls to avoid:

Micromanaging. Trust your team to do their jobs.
Taking credit for others’ work. Always give credit where it’s due.
Ignoring feedback. Dismissing concerns can lead to disengagement.
Inconsistency. Be fair and consistent in your expectations and decisions.
Neglecting recognition. Don’t underestimate the power of appreciation.<code a=""PHRA"" c=""

Response: nan,"<input>I'm really sorry to hear about everything you're going through. It sounds like you've got a lot on your plate right now, and that can be so overwhelming.

First, I think it's important to try and take things one step at a time. When everything feels like too much, break it down into smaller tasks. Start with one thing, even if it’s something small, and take it from there. It’ll help you feel like you’re making progress.

Also, don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Sometimes we try to handle everything ourselves, but reaching out to friends, family, or even a professional can lighten the load. If you feel like your stress is taking a toll on your health, make sure to take care of yourself—try to get some sleep, eat well, and even go for a walk to clear your mind.

Lastly, don’t forget to make time for yourself, even if it’s just a short break to recharge. You deserve it.

I'm really sorry to hear about the tough week you've had. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and it's completely okay to feel overwhelmed.

Regarding work, it might help to have an open conversation with your new management. Express your concerns and share how acknowledgment motivates you and your colleagues. Sometimes, managers aren't aware of the impact their actions (or lack thereof) have.

As for your situation with Tia, relationships can be challenging, and it's important to communicate openly with her. If things aren't working out, it's okay to take a step back and think about what you both need. Remember, it's better to be honest about your feelings than to let things fester.

Don't hesitate to reach out to friends or family who can lend an ear. Sometimes just talking things through with someone you trust can make a huge difference. Remember to take care of yourself, too—whether that's through exercise, meditation, or just taking some time to relax.

I have completed my investigation into your staff’s lack of compliance with the code of conduct. Here are my findings:

Male employees regularly smoke in the toilet.

Many female employees do not abide by the dress code (jeans, short skirts, etc.).

Certain employees are often late for work.

Workspaces are not clean and tidy; in fact, they are messy.

Confidential documents are often taken out of the office.

Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Now use your notes to write the next section of the exercise report. Include your observations and recommendations about psychological operations. Write the report as clearly and concisely as possible. Write 150-200 words. Response: nan,"<input>Psychological Operations (PsyOps) Assessment

The PsyOps component of the exercise was a significant disappointment given the considerable investment in resources and training. The operation failed to effectively support the exercise objectives and revealed serious shortcomings.

A major factor contributing to this failure was the late decision-making regarding the content of political messages in the leaflets. This delay, combined with a poorly staffed civil exercise cell composed largely of inexperienced personnel, hindered effective coordination with the military PsyOps team. Language barriers and communication issues further impaired cooperation.

Operational mistakes included the last-minute decision to conduct three airdrops in Arabic, English, and Farsi, which resulted in aircraft dropping leaflets in incorrect locations. This caused protests from exercise participants acting as civilians and troops, and more seriously, objections from the host nation and official observers over leaflet content and language. The incident led to diplomatic tensions and violent disputes among observers<code a=""PHRA"" c="""">.

Briefings were inadequate, with many personnel missing or misunderstanding instructions, resulting in delayed or ignored orders</code>.

To improve future PsyOps, it is essential to establish a clearer command structure, enhance pre-exercise briefings, improve language skills, and strengthen liaison with multinational participants<code a=""PHRA"" c="". Furthermore, early decision-making and better staff training should be prioritized to avoid similar issues""></code>.</input>",1dc879f7-2765-4ba4-90f6-522fa596e03c,7.0,0,0,0,True,0.6074,"{'Score 0': 0.6074, 'Score 1': 0.3169, 'Score 2': 0.0671, 'Score 3': 0.0043, 'Score 4': 0.0021, 'Score 5': 0.0026}"

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. It sounds like work has been incredibly stressful, especially with the new management. It's frustrating when your efforts aren't recognized. Maybe it would help to have a candid conversation with your manager about how you're feeling. Sometimes, they might not be aware of the impact their actions have on the team.

Regarding Tia, relationships can be really challenging, and it's tough when things don't go as expected. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings and see if there's a way to work through the issues together. If it does come to an end, remember that it's okay to feel sad and take time to heal.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: Use the information in the notes to write an informative text about NAFTA, or write about a trade agreement your country is a part of. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a trilateral trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Implemented in 1994, NAFTA aimed to reduce trade barriers and facilitate the exchange of goods and services among its member countries.

NAFTA has had a significant impact on the economies of its member countries. The agreement has increased trade volumes, economic growth, and investment opportunities. For example, trade between the US and Mexico has grown from $81 billion in 1993 to over $600 billion today.

Key provisions of NAFTA include:

- Tariff reduction and elimination
- Simplified customs procedures
- Protection of intellectual property rights
- Dispute resolution mechanisms

While NAFTA has faced criticism and challenges, it remains an important trade agreement for North America. Its impact on regional economic integration and cooperation has been substantial, and it continues to shape trade policies and practices in the region.

In 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which builds upon the foundation established by NAFTA and addresses new trade issues, such as digital trade and labor rights.

Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Rewrite the termination section of the contract to take into account possible discrimination either against or by the employer or employee. Compare your amendment with the model. This is a non-graded activity. Response: nan,"<input>Termination of Employment (Revised)

7.1. Following the successful completion of the probationary term of employment as outlined in paragraph 4, Party A may terminate the employment of Party B at any time, provided such termination is in compliance with applicable laws regarding <code a=""NOUN"" c=""non-""></code>discrimination:

(a) For just cause at common law: In this case, Party B is not entitled to any advance notice of termination or compensation in lieu of notice. Just cause includes, but is not limited to, instances of gross misconduct or violations of the law, excluding any actions that could be deemed discriminatory or in violation of protected characteristics, including but not limited to race, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, religion, or any other status protected by applicable law.

(b) Without just cause: In this case, Party A shall provide Party B with advance notice of termination or compensation in lieu of notice equal to one month, plus two weeks for each full year of service with Party A, up to a maximum of fifteen (15) months. This provision shall not be invoked in circumstances where termination may be construed as discriminatory based on Party B's protected characteristics.

7.2. Party B may terminate his employment at any time by providing Party A with at least eight (8) weeks' advance notice of his intention to resign. This notice period may be adjusted in cases where the termination is a response to discriminatory practices or a hostile work environment, as defined by applicable discrimination laws<code a=""PHRA"" c="""">.

Comparison with the Original Model:

The revised section retains the original structure and stipulations regarding termination but explicitly incorporates protections against discrimination for both parties. It emphasizes that just cause cannot include grounds that could be considered discriminatory and affirms that termination without cause should also respect the principles of non-discrimination. Additionally, it allows for flexibility in the resignation notice period if the employee's decision to leave is prompted by discriminatory practices, thus promoting a fair and equitable workplace</code>.</input>",c2b11467-88a4-414c-b759-f88079c5b4d5,7.0,0,0,0,True,0.592,"{'Score 0': 0.5918, 'Score 1': 0.3379, 'Score 2': 0.0679, 'Score 3': 0.0017, 'Score 4': 0.0004, 'Score 5': 0.0002}"

I hope this message finds you well. We are aware of the recent concerns circulating within our shareholder community regarding the stability of Future Foundations Construction Company. We deeply value your trust and would like to take this opportunity to address these concerns and reinforce our unwavering commitment to maintaining stability in the market.

First and foremost, we would like to clarify that the rumors about our share prices declining and potentially wiping out investments are completely unfounded. While the market can be unpredictable, we want to assure you that we are fully committed to ensuring the long-term success and stability of the company.

It is true that our share value experienced a drop two months ago, but this was directly related to the resignation of our former CEO, Greg Johnson. This transition naturally caused some temporary uncertainty. However, we are pleased to inform you that our new CEO, Harry Levi, has brought a wealth of experience and a strong reputation in the industry.<code a=""ORTH"" c=""""> </code>
