Response: Oliver Murray has been with our sales team for just one year, but he has already made a significant impact. He had a very strong start, quickly demonstrating intelligence, creativity, and a strong work ethic. His ability to generate innovative ideas and avoid mistakes is impressive. One of Oliver’s major contributions was identifying and fixing a product error that saved the company a substantial amount of money.

However, there are areas for improvement. Oliver recently missed two important deadlines and failed to communicate with the team, which affected project coordination. While he is exceptionally clever and driven, he would benefit from focusing more on team dynamics and improving communication.

Companies have a big impact on society. They should help the communities where they operate. After all, those communities are letting them do business there. It's a two-way street.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: When it comes to choosing favorite cities, New York City is always at the top of my list. The Big Apple is a whirlwind of energy, with its iconic skyline, diverse culture, and endless possibilities. It's the kind of place where you can find yourself eating a bagel in Central Park in the morning, visiting the Met in the afternoon, and catching a Broadway show by night. The city is a living, breathing entity, always on the move. The subway system, though sometimes chaotic, is a lifeline that connects the city's vibrant neighborhoods, each with its own unique flavor.

On the flip side, Tokyo offers a completely different but equally captivating experience. The first thing that strikes you about Tokyo is its incredible blend of the ultramodern and the traditional. One moment you're in the neon-lit streets of Shibuya, surrounded by towering digital billboards, and the next, you're in a serene temple in Asakusa, taking in the tranquility. Tokyo’s public transportation is a marvel of efficiency and cleanliness, making it easy to explore every corner of the city. The food scene is another highlight, with everything from world-class sushi to comforting bowls of ramen.

New York and Tokyo are both dynamic cities, but they offer different vibes. New York is all about diversity and cultural richness; it's a place where you can experience the world in a single city. Tokyo, on the other hand, impresses with its seamless integration of cutting edge technology and deeprooted traditions.

As he walked, a tantalizing aroma of baking pastries filled the air, guiding him to a quaint bakery that was mysteriously bustling with activity.
Curiosity piqued, Alex approached the bakery and peeked inside. To his astonishment, the interior was alive with customers dressed in styles from the 1920s, all enjoying their treats as if time had folded upon itself. Had I known I'd step into the past, Alex thought, I might have dressed differently!
Compelled by the blend of curiosity and the inviting smell of fresh scones, Alex entered the bakery. Inside, he mingled with the patrons, absorbing stories wrapped in historical flavors. He even received a cherished scone recipe from a kindly old baker.
As the clock struck midnight, the magic unraveled. The lively scene faded, and the bakery returned to its abandoned state.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: Use the information in the notes to write an informative text about NAFTA, or write about a trade agreement your country is a part of. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a trilateral trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Implemented in 1994, NAFTA aimed to reduce trade barriers and facilitate the exchange of goods and services among its member countries.

NAFTA has had a significant impact on the economies of its member countries. The agreement has increased trade volumes, economic growth, and investment opportunities. For example, trade between the US and Mexico has grown from $81 billion in 1993 to over $600 billion today.

Key provisions of NAFTA include:

- Tariff reduction and elimination
- Simplified customs procedures
- Protection of intellectual property rights
- Dispute resolution mechanisms

While NAFTA has faced criticism and challenges, it remains an important trade agreement for North America. Its impact on regional economic integration and cooperation has been substantial, and it continues to shape trade policies and practices in the region.

In 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which builds upon the foundation established by NAFTA and addresses new trade issues, such as digital trade and labor rights.

New York City, often referred to as ""The Big Apple,"" is a bustling metropolis known for its vibrant culture and towering skyscrapers. The city thrives on its fast-paced lifestyle, with people constantly on the move. The energy in NYC is palpable, whether you're walking through Times Square or riding the subway. It’s a melting pot of cultures, and this diversity is reflected in its food, neighborhoods, and festivals. The iconic skyline, featuring landmarks like the Empire State Building, gives the city a unique, unmistakable character.

On the other hand, Tokyo, Japan, offers a very different but equally fascinating experience. The city blends modern technology with traditional customs, making it a unique fusion of old and new. While the streets of Tokyo are just as busy as New York’s, there’s a sense of calm in the midst of all the hustle. Tokyo’s meticulous organization is evident in its efficient public transport system and the careful balance of green spaces amid urban sprawl. Unlike NYC’s chaotic energy, Tokyo's vibe is more orderly yet still vibrant, offering a serene escape in its parks and temples.

Both cities offer remarkable experiences, but while New York pulses with raw energy and diversity, Tokyo provides a harmonious blend of tradition and modernity.

I’d like to begin by highlighting one of the key achievements this quarter — the renewal of our partnership with Crum. This wasn’t just a routine agreement; the organization specifically praised our dedication to quality, which reflects the collective effort behind our work.

That said, this success didn’t come without its challenges. Just three months ago, we were dealing with unresolved defects that put our client relationships at risk. On top of that, there were several minor technical issues that added complexity.

To overcome these obstacles, we introduced two major changes. First, the update delivery process was revised. Second, Quality Assurance procedures were strengthened. These improvements wouldn’t have been possible without strong collaboration across teams — something I believe all of us can be proud of.

Looking ahead, we’re committed to providing even more proactive support to prevent similar issues and ensure continued satisfaction for this partner and others we work with.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: An airplane is made up of several key parts, each with its own important function. The fuselage is the central body of the airplane, where the cockpit, passengers, and cargo are located. It connects all the other parts of the airplane and provides structural support1.

The wings are attached to the fuselage and are the primary lift-generating surfaces. They house control surfaces like ailerons, flaps, and slats, which help control the airplane's movement12.

The tail, also known as the empennage, includes the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. These stabilizers provide stability and control, keeping the airplane flying straight.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: he debate on whether companies have a responsibility to society or solely to their shareholders is a complex one that reflects broader questions about the role of business in the contemporary world. Both perspectives present valid arguments, and my position leans towards a balanced approach that acknowledges the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) while recognizing the need for profitability.

On one hand, companies undoubtedly have a significant impact on the communities in which they operate. This impact extends beyond economic contributions to include environmental and social dimensions. As lil@213 mentioned, businesses and communities exist in a symbiotic relationship. Companies benefit from the resources, labor, and infrastructure provided by these communities, and, in return, they have a moral obligation to contribute positively to societal well-being. Moreover, as Jack@MSU highlighted, CSR can enhance a company's reputation and foster customer loyalty, ultimately benefiting the bottom line. Consumers today are increasingly aware of and concerned about the ethical practices of the companies they support, making CSR not just a moral choice but a strategic business decision.

On the other hand, critics like theG8T remind us of Milton Friedman's view that a corporation's primary responsibility is to its shareholders. While profit is undoubtedly a key driver of business success, this perspective can be too narrow, especially in an era where social and environmental challenges are pressing. JackD_92 points out that CSR efforts are sometimes perceived as mere marketing strategies rather than genuine contributions, which can undermine their effectiveness and authenticity.

A middle ground can be found by recognizing that businesses can pursue profit while also addressing societal needs. This is not only feasible but often beneficial in the long term. Companies that integrate CSR into their core operations can innovate, improve risk management, and create a sustainable competitive advantage. It's also important to note, as patty925 suggests, that governments play a crucial role in setting the regulatory framework within which businesses operate. Effective regulation can guide and incentivize companies to act in socially responsible ways without usurping the role of businesses in driving innovation and economic growth.","<input><code a=""SPELL"" c=""The"">he</code> debate on whether companies have a responsibility to society or solely to their shareholders is a complex one that reflects broader questions about the role of business in the contemporary world.

It’s a real pleasure to be here with you today. For those of you I haven’t met yet, my name is Ana, and I work as Business Consultant here at BonVoyager. Thank you for taking the time to join us – it’s great to see so many new faces in the room.

Today, I’d like to take you on a brief journey through our company’s story – where we began, how far we’ve come, and where we’re heading next.

Most people recognise us as a finance company – and that’s completely fair, considering how much we’ve grown in that space. But what often surprises people is that our roots are actually in the travel industry. Yes, really – when we first opened our doors, our mission was to help people explore the world. It’s fascinating to see how that spirit of exploration has stayed with us, even as we shifted focus.

Over the past few years, we've undergone some exciting changes – adapting to a fast-moving world, expanding our services, and staying true to what makes us unique. And now, as we look to the future, we’re more committed than ever to innovation, partnership, and delivering real value to our clients. To wrap up, my key mission in BonVoyager is to increase the experience of our customers by creating a spetecular travel and that is how the profits come.","<input>Good morning everyone,

"Prompt Level: 11.0 Prompt: Write a paragraph about how media has changed in your lifetime. What media was important before? What do you use now, and how has it changed your reading habits? Pay attention to your use of commas, colons and semicolons. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. Response: The media landscape has undergone dramatic changes over the past few decades, shaped by technological advancements, shifting consumer habits, and societal transformations. From the dominance of print newspapers to the rise of digital platforms, these changes have revolutionized how we create, consume, and interact with information.

1. Traditional to Digital
In the past, media was primarily distributed through newspapers, magazines, radio, and television. These formats followed a one-way communication model where media organizations produced content, and audiences consumed it passively. The internet disrupted this model, introducing digital media platforms that allow for instantaneous, global communication. Online publications, blogs, and social media have replaced much of the print industry, offering faster access to information and diverse perspectives.

2. The Rise of Social Media
Social media has transformed how we interact with media, making it more personal, participatory, and immediate. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter (now X), Instagram, and TikTok enable users to become content creators, bypassing traditional gatekeepers. This shift has democratized information but also introduced challenges, such as misinformation and the erosion of trust in reliable sources.

3. 24/7 News Cycle
The advent of cable news and later online news platforms introduced the 24/7 news cycle, drastically increasing the speed of reporting. While this provides timely updates, it also pressures media outlets to prioritize speed over depth, sometimes leading to inaccuracies or sensationalism.","<input>The media landscape has undergone dramatic changes over the past few decades, shaped by technological advancements, shifting consumer habits, and societal transformations.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: The question of whether companies have a responsibility to society or if their primary obligation lies solely with shareholders is a complex and highly debated issue. I firmly believe that companies do have a responsibility to society, and this perspective aligns with the growing movement toward corporate social responsibility (CSR). First of all, companies are integral parts of the communities in which they operate. They benefit from the resources, infrastructure, and workforce that these communities provide. Businesses thrive in environments that are stable, sustainable, and supportive. Therefore, it is not only ethical but also pragmatic for companies to engage in practices that uplift their communities. This two-way relationship fosters goodwill and can enhance company's reputation, leading to increased customer loyalty and, ultimately, better financial performance.
Furthermore, the modern consumer is increasingly aware and concerned about social and environmental issues. As noted by Jack@MSU, a strong CSR record can significantly influence consumer choices. Companies that demonstrate a commitment to ethical practices and social responsibility often enjoy enhanced brand loyalty and, consequently, improved sales. This suggests that doing good and doing well are not mutually exclusive but can go hand-in-hand.
On the other hand, the arguments against CSR, such as those presented by Milton Friedman and others, emphasize a more traditional view that prioritizes shareholder profit above all else. While it is essential for businesses to be profitable, this narrow focus can lead to short-term thinking and potentially harmful practices that disregard the broader implications of their operations on society and the environment. Moreover, the argument that it is the government's 
role to enforce social responsibility fails to acknowledge that businesses have a unique opportunity to drive positive change. Many societal issues can be more effectively addressed by innovative corporate strategies rather than relying solely on regulatory frameworks. Companies have the resources and influence to implement impactful initiatives that address social challenges directly, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future. In conclusion, I believe that companies not only have a responsibility to their shareholders but also to the societies in which they operate. By embracing CSR, businesses can build stronger relationships with their communities, enhance their brand reputation, and ultimately drive sustainable success.

Dear Valued Shareholders,

We want to address your concerns and reaffirm Future Foundations Construction Company's strong and stable position in the market.

First, let us be clear: the recent rumors about share prices plummeting are entirely false. While it is true that share value experienced a brief dip two months ago due to the resignation of our former CEO, Greg Johnson, this was a temporary adjustment. Since then, with the appointment of Harry Levi—an industry leader with a stellar reputation—our share value has recovered and reached a historic high.

In an ever-fluctuating construction market, Future Foundations continues to thrive by focusing on stability and sustainable growth. We have secured three major contracts for the next three years, guaranteeing steady profits and reinforcing our leadership in the industry.

We deeply value your loyalty and belief in our mission. With your support, the company is on track for a promising future. To further reassure you, we will soon share our comprehensive five-year roadmap outlining our plans for continued growth and innovation.

Thank you for your trust. Together, we will build an even brighter future for Future Foundations.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: In France, robots are used in various sectors and improve the efficiency and safety of activities, their main uses are :
In industry to automate repetitive tasks to improve productivity, accuracy and working conditions. The negative aspect is that the low-skilled people who used these tasks before the use of robots no longer have a job and are difficult to reclassify.
In agriculture for cattle milking, cleaning and feeding, in wine production and market gardening, these autonomous robots reduce the use of chemical weed killers and preserve the soil.

For healthcare, robots can help surgeons with complex or remote procedures.
French companies are developing exoskeletons that allow paraplegics to regain mobility, or to help workers to carry heavy loads.

For security and emergency response, they allow access to dangerous areas without risk to firefighters, police or military.

Robotics in France is booming, in my opinion the only negative aspect being, as mentioned earlier, that it takes jobs away from low-skilled people who are difficult to reemploy.

Robots associated with AI will continue to advance in proportions that are difficult to imagine.

Hope you are doing well. 

This email is regarding the policy changes which happened last week. I am looking forward for this new policy of coming up with the free breakfast to all employees in the company.  This is a great initiative taken up by the company. Now most of the employees don't have to worry about preparing breakfast in the morning. The mornings are sorted for all our employees. The breakfast menu is very healthy which will avoid our employees to eat anything junk. This will be a good start of the day. This will also help employees to reach office on time as the breakfast time will be only till 10 am.  

I hope everyone is as excited as I am, and I am hoping  that, with your help and creativity, this new policy will be a big success to our company.

Thank you for your help.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Now write a report comparing the two car designs. Which design do you think you should go with? Persuade your design team to choose one of the designs for next year’s rollout. Write 100-150 words. Response: In today’s fast-paced automotive market, making the right car buying decision can be like navigating a complex maze. With numerous brands, models, specifications, options, colors, packages, and prices to consider, potential car buyers often find themselves overwhelmed by choices.

JATO’s recent survey of 2,500 future car buyers revealed that 29% of people would research online first when buying a new car. This is where car comparison tools can prove to be essential for securing new and repeat business on automotive websites.
1) Streamlining decision-making process
Imagine a customer is in the market for a hatchback and they’re looking at your brand. There are many things for them to consider – from price points to specification requirements – so having the right information is crucial to support the sales journey.

 

Using a car comparison tool, they can effortlessly access the facts they need, compare your model offering against direct competitors and evaluate specifications side by side. From engine performance and fuel efficiency to safety features and advanced technology, they will have a comprehensive overview that highlights key advantages and differences.

 

This information gives customers clarity and helps to simplify the decision-making process.
 Enhancing transparency and trust
Transparency is a cornerstone of modern business practices. By offering a car comparison tool, your brand can demonstrate its commitment to providing potential buyers with an honest and unbiased evaluation of their offerings. This fosters trust and reinforces the brand’s credibility – both crucial factors in building lasting customer relationships, recommendations, and repeat business.

 

3) Customisation tailored to individual preferences
Car comparison tools go beyond listing features. They allow potential buyers to explore the various options, colours, and packages available for each model. This means that a buyer can seamlessly experiment with different specifications according to their preferences, budget, and what is available in the market today.

 

According to JATO’s recent research, the top options people like to add if they have remaining budget are safety features (parking sensors, lane assist etc.). Therefore, a car comparison tool that allows customers to compare safety options from multiple brands – from price to capability – can enhance the customer experience.

 

Offering high levels of customisation and direct access to information gives the car buyer more power, ensuring that the final purchase aligns with their preferences and requirements.

 

4) Offering a digital first experience
The car buying journey has previously involved extensive research, various dealership visits, and test drives. Today, car comparison tools enable brands and customers to streamline the initial research phase, saving valuable time and energy. Customers browsing your website can now conveniently access all the information they need in one place, making the process more efficient and increasing customer satisfaction.

You have some notes and a graph as your guide. Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. Response: The Hang Seng Index (HSI) in Hong Kong has grown continously over the past six months, due to investment from Mainland China. By now, it is on it´s all-time high at nearly 28,000 points.

The reason for the developmenet seem to be that Properties and Utilities Sub-indices have risen dramatically, due to growth from China which still has a strong influence on the economics in Hong Kong. 

But the development hasn´t been as strong ever since the last year. Only a half year ago the index dropped from 26,000 below 21,000 in a very short period of time, but since then the index has gone up rose to a high of 27,499.

It is always hard to predict the future development, but experts seem to be optimistic that the index will continue rising. Main reasons for this are strong indicators such as massive investment from other countries, as well as Hong Kong’s internal demand.

Response: Hi, Earlier you emailed me for some ideas on what to include in your speech. Here's what I'd suggest: Greet the audience as usual, and say what the purpose of your speech is. A quote is an easy way to give your speech more meaning. How about this one: 'There's no substitute for hard work.' – Thomas Edison It's a reminder that there really are no short cuts in our industry, and success only comes with hard work. Feel free to use your own quote, though. Show thanks to the staff for their hard work this year. They've done a lot of overtime to make sure our sales goals were met.

Hi, Helena.

That is great news. I completely understand that we need to make sure the system is the right fit before we go any further.

Can you supply a link to access the demo system, and do I need login details?

Thanks again,

You do not need to write the addresses, greetings or the closing. Use a formal tone. Type in the input box. Write 80-100 words. Use your own words where possible. Response: Excuse me for asking about your schedule. Are you going to the conference next month? Suddenly, there are issues with our infrastructure suppliers. They need our help to resolve this quickly and want to schedule a meeting next month.
Due to these issues, should we postpone the company meeting until after the conference? I believe your presence is very necessary. Some issues require firm decisions, for example, our accounts department is looking into financial issues with our copper supplier.
As you know, our monitoring manager, Karina, was not motivated to deal with these demands and asked to leave the company. The board wants a quick replacement. Who is looking for a replacement for her? Please contact me by next Friday. Thank you for your understanding and I look forward to your support.

Hi,

Also, do you remember Tia, the girl I met in the coffee shop a few months ago? Well, things aren't going well between us, and I think we might end the relationship. That's got me feeling really down because I thought it was going well for a while.

Sorry for bothering you with this – I've got no one else to talk about this, and I just needed to vent. You always seem to be so calm and in control; maybe you have some advice for me on how I can deal with these problems?

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: You're going to write about an interesting, fictional event that happened to a friend. Write your blog post. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Last year during the winter holyday a friend of mine Federico travelled with a group of friend to Marrakesh, Morocco. It was a short stay, just a couple of days, a different gateaway than the classic mountain trip.

They decided to stay in a Riad, a typical moroccan house inside the Medina old city centre. The location was perfetct, just  a cuple of streets away from the the famous Jemaa el-Fnaa square.

The first day they explored the maze-like alleys of the Medina, and wandered the souks in search of little treasure to bring home. Spices, silk, ceramics and all kind of trinkets filled the stands to the brim.
Still the best part of the holiday remained the one day trip to the desert.

They departed early in the morning, the city was calm and silent still asleep in the early hours, such a contrast to the buzzing  and bustling evenings!
Halfaway the car ride they had a stop to a local Argan shop; it was a only female traditional company. They watched them make all argan byproducts, oil but also marmalade, butter an honey. I'd never imagined there were so much different things made of it!

After enjoyung a nice mint tea an some typical pastry they boarded the bus to reach their true destination. Near a rural village the cap was set; after setting their stuff they prepared for the camel ride in the desert. Imangine: a whole grop of 10 adults wobbling an shuffling prcauriosly on top of their mighty steeds, it must have been hilarious!
The dinner was served at the sunset all typical food, chicken and lamb tajines, cous cous, soups and bread and at the end the mandatory mint tea obviously! They watched a beatiful show of mroccan songs and dancing and even a fire show just before retiring for the night.

Last but not least they wake up around 1 a.m. to watch the night sky; without the light pollution and in the endless plains of the desert surrounding them the number of stars was countless!

As their trip came to an end, they promised to return to Morocco to visit all the other missing city from Casablanca to Rabat. For the time being they wait for their next adventure, Istanbul here they come!

Job name: Zen Boutique Hotel & Spa, and Health & Fitness Center 

Proposed by: Ferreira Studio Inc. 

Contact: Jorge Ferreira, Creative Manager (jorge.ferreira@ferreira-studio.com) 

Ferreira Studio hereby proposes the design and construction of the Zen Boutique Hotel & Spa, and Health & Fitness Center on Fake Street, CA. The center will provide first-level hotel and spa services as well as gym, health and fitness services. The estimated cost of the project is $37 million. 

Strategic summary 

AccomData Group, which we hired to conduct market research, reported that this project had found a niche in growing trends in weekend getaways to relaxing resorts, greater attention to healthy lifestyle. Their surveys revealed that our target customers, young professionals aged 25 to 40, are unsatisfied with the cuisine in most fitness centers. They highly value healthy menus with top chefs from renowned restaurants. Additionally, they are also attracted to the idea of having fully equipped gyms and swimming pools with trained instructors. 

The construction time is estimated in 2 years. We forecast an almost immediate return on your investment. By the end of Year 2, the forecasted revenue will have a surplus of $1 million, with profits rising to $6 million a year by Year 5. We guarantee that within four years, Capet's Capital will have recouped its investment and start realizing a profit after five years. 

Risk assessment 

Using a reputable insurance company to compile a risk assessment analysis, we've factored any possible economic downturn into our forecasted revenues and profits. If the economy remains stable, the period required for recouping investment and realizing profits could be cut in half. 

We've already engaged Kudos Advertising Agency, who have planned and designed thorough media and advertising coverage. An intensive campaign has been organized to start six months before our grand opening event. ","<input>Proposal submitted to: Martin Sanabria, Sanabria’s Capital

The idea for Zen, our planned $4million “boutique” hotel, which will encapsulate a spa and health and fitness center came from recent market research by the AccomData Group. While there has been a growing trend in weekend getaway to relaxing resorts as well as greater attention to a healthy lifestyle, surveys show that most fitness centers offer an unsatisfying cuisine. This is why on addition to fully equipped gyms and swimming pools with trained instructors, Zen will also offer a healthy menu elaborated by elite chefs from the world’s most renowned restaurants. 
With the construction time estimated to take just two years, we foresee a return on investment by the second year after opening and a projected yearly profit of $1 million after that, which means that in just four years from opening the initial investment will be recouped and from then onwards we foresee only profits.
Risk Assessment
We have carried out a comprehensive risk assessment which has factored any potential economic downturn in the figures presented. Should the economy remain stable, the period required for recouping investment and realizing profits could be halved. To ensure the best possible initial outcome, we have planned an intensive media campaign being carried out by Kudos Advertising Agency.","<input>Strategic Summary<code a=""PHRA"" c=""

Give a few more details about the hotel's highlights that may appeal to different customers.

the perfect location close to the heart of the city, convenient transport and nearby cultural attractions. Tourists would love this.

classy lounge and restaurant – a great choice for business travelers if they need to meet with partners or clients

spacious and well-equipped meeting space - can handle conferences and conventions

Come up with a tagline. The message is that every stay is different but memorable.
I'd like to have a draft of the promotional leaflet by the end of the week. Then we can get the design team to work on the layout. We'll also add some testimonials from reviewers later.

Here are some tips for motivating your team, I included some things to avoid too.

• Be empathetic with your employees, put yourself in their shoes and try to understand the situation when they disagree with something.

• Incentivize and recognize your team. A reward always motivates people and they feel part of the company and most important, they feel that what they do it’s important for the company success.

And something’s to avoid demotivate your employees:

• Take credit for work done by you subordinates.
• Disrespect them because you are the boss.
• Lose your temper.
• Don’t recognize the people when they are doing a good work.
• Don’t be the example.

I have completed my investigation into your staff’s lack of compliance with the code of conduct. Here are my findings:

Male employees regularly smoke in the toilet.

Many female employees do not abide by the dress code (jeans, short skirts, etc.).

Certain employees are often late for work.

Workspaces are not clean and tidy; in fact, they are messy.

Confidential documents are often taken out of the office.

It seems obvious to me a new code of conduct is needed, and I think you should write it ASAP. Something needs to be done!

Hey,

I’ve had a look at your draft speech. Overall, I think you’re on the right track but I’d suggest adding a little more cohesion so it all hangs together better. Each point should flow smoothly from the last, and it helps to refer back to previous points when relevant. You might also want to use different words to refer to Crum so you don’t repeat yourself too much.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your friend is about to open a secondhand clothes shop. He doesn’t have much capital, and is renting a very old building. He has got a few quotes for property and liability insurance, but they have been very high. He asks you to do a risk assessment of the premises. Have a look at your checklist, then write him an email advising him of the changes he has to make. Write 150-200 words. Response: Property and Liability Insurance Assessment 
Falling Bricks:
The primary hazard is the potential for loose bricks to fall, causing injury to people or damage to property.
Potential for Falling Objects:
Other falling objects, like debris from mortar or other materials associated with loose bricks, should also be considered.
Structural Integrity:
Loose bricks may indicate a broader structural issue, potentially increasing the risk of further damage. 
Severity:
Evaluate the potential impact of falling bricks, considering factors like:
Height of bricks: Higher bricks increase the potential for significant impact and injury.
Brick material: Bricks made of heavier materials pose a higher risk.
Location of bricks: Bricks located near pathways, windows, or open areas increase the likelihood of someone being struck.
Condition of bricks: Evaluate the looseness of the bricks and how long they have been loose.
Weather conditions: Evaluate the impact of wind, rain, and temperature on the bricks.
Structural integrity: If the wall has a history of issues, this increases the likelihood of falling bricks. 
Property Liability Insurance:
Property owners are often covered for liability claims if someone is injured on their property, including injuries caused by falling bricks. 
Duty of Care:
Owners have a duty to maintain their property and ensure it is safe for others. Failure to address loose bricks could lead to liability claims. 
Negligence:
If an owner knew or should have known about the loose bricks and failed to address them, they could be found liable for damages. 
Warning Signs:
If repairs are not feasible or immediate, warning signs can be used to alert people to the potential hazard.
Regular Inspections:
Regular inspections of the exterior can help identify and address loose bricks before they become a significant hazard.
