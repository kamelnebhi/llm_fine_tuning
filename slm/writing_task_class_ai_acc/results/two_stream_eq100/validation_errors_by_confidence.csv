Response: Last weekend, my friend Lila experienced something so strange, she still isn’t sure it was real. She had gone on a solo hike in the Lakewood Forest, a peaceful place known for its quiet trails and occasional deer sightings. About halfway through her hike, Lila spotted an old stone well she swore hadn’t been there before. Curious, she walked up to it and looked inside—expecting darkness or maybe some water. Instead, she saw what looked like a flickering campfire deep below, and she heard faint music, like a violin playing an old tune.

Before she could react, a gust of wind blew through the trees, and a folded piece of parchment flew out of the well, landing at her feet. It had no writing, just a strange symbol: a key inside a circle. When she looked back into the well, everything was gone—no fire, no music. Just darkness.

Lila hiked back, feeling uneasy but strangely thrilled. She still has the parchment and is determined to find out what the symbol means. Was it a prank? A portal? We don’t know—but it’s a mystery worth chasing.

I hope you're both doing well. After reviewing the two proposals, I’d like to suggest a third option that I believe could be a great fit for our city's needs and long-term goals.

In addition to the current plans, I propose that we focus on revitalizing the River District, which has seen an increase in interest from both residents and businesses. The area offers unique opportunities for green space, cultural events, and riverfront developments. With the recent growth in tech companies and startups in our city, there is a rising demand for flexible workspaces that encourage collaboration and creativity.

We could invest in transforming the River District into a vibrant mixed-use development with office spaces, recreational areas, and cultural hubs that reflect the city's commitment to innovation and sustainability. This approach would not only attract investment but also support the local economy and provide an exciting new destination for both locals and tourists.

Let me know what you think about this idea.

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. As we move forward into the upcoming week, I would like to outline the key priorities for our team.

Firstly, we need to focus on completing the project proposal for our new client by Friday. This is our highest priority, as it will determine our next steps with the client. Please ensure all tasks are aligned with the proposal's requirements and submit any sections to me for review by Thursday afternoon.

Secondly, we need to prepare for the team presentation on Monday. Each team member will be responsible for one section, so please start preparing your materials. We will have a rehearsal on Friday afternoon to go over the presentation and address any concerns.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: In my country, Brazil, buying a home and applying for a home loan can be a challenging and time-consuming process. First, property prices in major cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are quite high, especially in central or well-developed neighborhoods. For many people, buying a house without a loan is almost impossible, so most rely on financing options offered by banks or government programs like “Minha Casa, Minha Vida.”

The process of applying for a home loan usually involves a lot of paperwork. Applicants must provide proof of income, employment history, tax returns, identification documents, and sometimes even a credit history report. The bank will carefully evaluate the borrower’s financial situation before approving the loan.

Interest rates in Brazil tend to be higher than in some other countries. They usually range from 8% to 12% per year, depending on the applicant’s profile, the chosen bank, and the loan term. Recently, government incentives and lower Selic rates have slightly reduced mortgage rates, but they are still considered expensive.

Using a real estate agent is not required, but many people choose to work with one to help find suitable properties and negotiate with sellers. Some also use mortgage brokers to assist with the loan process. Overall, buying a home in Brazil requires patience, financial planning, and good organization to handle all the required steps and documents.

Dear Boss,

I hope this email finds you well. As we look ahead, there are a couple of key challenges that I believe we should be mindful of.

Firstly, increasing competition in our industry could affect our market share. To tackle this, we should focus on differentiating our services through innovation and customer-centric solutions. Strengthening our brand identity will also help maintain customer loyalty.

Secondly, the rapid pace of technological change presents both an opportunity and a threat. We must invest in continuous training for our team to ensure we're using the latest tools efficiently. Moreover, adopting new technologies will help us stay ahead in the market.

I believe addressing these challenges proactively will help secure our future growth and success.

Students often face several issues and challenges that can hinder their progress. 

**What are the common difficulties in language learning?** One major challenge is **pronunciation**. Many students struggle with mastering the sounds and intonation patterns of a new language, which can lead to misunderstandings. **How does grammar affect language learning?** Grammar rules can be complex and different from the student's native language, making it difficult to construct sentences correctly. **What role does vocabulary play?** Building a robust vocabulary is essential, but memorizing new words and their meanings can be overwhelming.

**How do cultural differences impact learning?** Cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions can be confusing and hard to grasp. **What about motivation and confidence?** Maintaining motivation and confidence is crucial; students often feel discouraged by slow progress or fear of making mistakes. **How can practice opportunities be limited?** Limited opportunities to practice speaking with native speakers can impede fluency development.

Addressing these challenges requires patience, consistent practice, and sometimes seeking additional resources or support from teachers and peers.

What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. Response: Developing leadership qualities is an ongoing process that involves self-knowledge, practice and learning from experiences.

One of the first lessons I learned was the importance of empathy. In a group project in college, I realized that listening to each team member's concerns and ideas not only strengthened our relationship but also led to more creative solutions. When a leader puts himself in others' shoes, he creates an environment of trust and collaboration, essential for the group's success.

Most important quality is emphaty because empathy is an extraordinary quality that brings countless benefits to both personal and professional relationships. When we are empathetic, we are able to put ourselves in someone else's shoes, understanding their emotions, challenges and perspectives. This not only strengthens bonds between people, but also creates an environment of trust and respect.

I’m Ticiana, and it’s a pleasure to welcome you to Frisko Shipping. Today, I’d like to share a bit about our company’s journey and what makes us a unique and exciting place to work.

Frisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko. What started as a small venture has now grown into a global powerhouse with locations in 20 cities around the world and more than 5,000 dedicated employees. Last year, we achieved a remarkable profit of 5 million dollars and captured 10 percent of the global market.

But beyond the numbers, what truly sets us apart is our team. We expect our new employees to be motivated and enthusiastic, ready to contribute to our ongoing success.

Let me share a personal story about Bill Frisko, our founder. Many of you might not know this, but Bill’s inspiration to start Frisko Shipping came from a life-changing experience. He once fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. Miraculously, a passing ship saved his life. This event sparked his passion for shipping and led to the creation of our company. It’s a powerful reminder that inspiration can come from the most unexpected places.
As you embark on this journey with us, I encourage you to think about what inspires you and how you can bring that passion to your work here at Frisko Shipping. Let’s make waves together and continue to drive our company forward.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your friend is about to open a secondhand clothes shop. He doesn’t have much capital, and is renting a very old building. He has got a few quotes for property and liability insurance, but they have been very high. He asks you to do a risk assessment of the premises. Have a look at your checklist, then write him an email advising him of the changes he has to make. Write 150-200 words. Response: Subject: Risk Assessment & Safety Recommendations for Your Shop

Hi [Friend's Name],

I visited the premises and went through a basic risk assessment checklist. There are a few key changes you'll need to make to improve safety and potentially reduce your insurance costs:

Electrical Safety – The wiring looks outdated. Get a certified electrician to inspect and upgrade it if needed.

Fire Safety – Install smoke detectors, a fire extinguisher, and ensure clear access to exits. Consider adding signage.

Trip Hazards – Repair uneven floors and secure any loose rugs or cables to avoid customer injuries.

Lighting – Improve lighting, especially near the entrance and in storage areas, to prevent accidents.

Security – Install basic CCTV and sturdy locks to reduce theft risks, which may also help lower insurance quotes.

Making these changes should not only make the shop safer but may also help bring down those high insurance premiums. Let me know if you want help getting quotes or finding contractors.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Now write a report comparing the two car designs. Which design do you think you should go with? Persuade your design team to choose one of the designs for next year’s rollout. Write 100-150 words. Response: After comparing the two car designs, Design A stands out as the stronger choice for next year’s rollout.

Its aerodynamic form not only improves fuel efficiency but also enhances performance.

From a production standpoint, Design A is more feasible, with fewer complex components that could delay manufacturing or increase costs. It balances innovation with practicality, making it a smart, forward-looking option.

Despite the difficulties and barries the agreement was signed by the membres. It in fact reduced or eliminated customs duties among the members facilitating the customers to have access to products among these countries at  lower prices without tariffs and aditional costs.
It has had a profound effect on trade relations, especially in agriculture; for example, Mexican fruits and vegetables flow into the US.

CRS performs actions like to reduce the electric maintenance, the energetic efficiency and the sound and light contamination. CRS it also takes in account the well-being of the people like good salaries, workday and working conditions. 

There are some critics that believe CRS is only a stunt to improve their image and consequently their benefits. I understand that it is difficult to think in CRS when we are living in a society where the most important are the results. However, we have to take the courage to fight for these improvements and try to achieve a better planet for everybody.

To sum up, I strongly believe that CRS is the best way to improve the future for the world. The governments may collaborate with the companies to achieve this goal.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: You see a niche in the hotel market and decide to write a business proposal for investors. Write the **strategic summary** and **risk assessment** sections of the proposal using the notes. Write 140–200 words. Response: Dear Investors,

My name is Sophie B. and I am from the Zen Hotel chain.

Let me introduce you our hotel shortly. 
Zen is a boutique hotel, which is also a spa and a health and fitness center.

The costs which we have to pay is 4,000,000$. I know that sounds pretty much but the hotel will be a very big one so it will be worth it.

Here are some general facts why you should support us:

- The growing trends in weekend getaways o relaxing resorts, greater attention to healthy lifestyle (market research from AccomData Group)

- The unsatisfying cuisine in most fitness centers (survey by AccomData Group)

- The fully equipped gyms and swimming pools with trained instructors

- The construction time will just take two years

- You get the payback in the second year after opening

- We have a projected profit per year after the second year which is about 1,000,000$

- Our estimated time for recouping investment are just 
four years from opening and we will get some profit after the 5th year from opening

Of course there are some risks.

- Any economic downturn has been factored into the above figures.

- If the economy remains stable, the period required for recouping investment and realizing profits could be cut in half.

- intensive media campaign planned by Kudos Advertising Agency

As you can see we put very much of love, money and effort in this big project.

We hope you answer soon.

Thank you for your support.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Write a summary of no more than 50-60 words about the case. Use the words below. This is a non-graded activity. Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.

In the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.

During the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.

Dear Mr. Samson,

Below are the results of the surveys you requested, which were conducted in Rio de Janeiro and Shanghai.

To summarize our method: we took a sample covering all the demographics and asked how they felt about the collarless dress shirt.

If you have any queries, do not hesitate to contact me.

Collarless dress shirt: facts and figures

Interviewed:

Rio de Janeiro – 1000

Shanghai – 1000

Rio de Janeiro:

Approve: 35% (would buy: 20%)                  Not approve: 65%

Shanghai:

Approve: 80% (would buy: 40%)                   Not approve: 20%

For the 65% in Rio and the 20% in Shanghai, it is not a highly desirable item for several reasons:

design

size

color

material

For the 20% in Rio and the 40% in Shanghai who 'would buy,' they expressed moderate satisfaction. Some factors that kept them from feeling strongly satisfied:

Before launching, not enough market research carried out

Good idea, bad execution

General feeling is that diversity was not considered in product design

How about talking on improvement and quality that make all of us happy and very proud of?...

People who work as a team defeat its opponents and get better each time, that’s why we got a renewal of our partnership with Crum. 
And yes, we have challenges to overcome to keep winning, like those unresolved defects that we had 3 months ago… we’re going to tackle them each at a time.
Tech issues are a minor problem so we can let them for the rookies to take care of (I’m joking! but also recognizing that each pair of hands are key for the team’s result in this game).
What is going to be the winning strategy now? changed update delivery to solve each one of the reported defects. But if we want to be the champions and really beat all of our competitors, it is key to improve our quality assurance processes and cross-team collaboration is essential to make that happen.
You know what people?  You are winners and you have to be proud about your great job and effort, that’s why our partners praised our dedication to quality… so congratulations to all of us!!!.. we work as a team and celebrate as a team.
Hey!... let’s keep up with the great work (our winning strategy) and offer further support to avoid those problems with customers, I know that we can keep improving, we are a dedicated and winning squad.

Learning language can be difficult and need a lot of effort for me.
There are many reasons that I feel it difficult. One of the biggest challenges is making time for language learning in my dairy life. There are so many things to do every day, it's hard to study. But, if I want to succeed in language learning, I need to engage intermittently with the language i'm learning.

Another obstacle is fear of making mistakes. I am not confident in the language that I'm learning. So, I tend to hesitate to use it for fear of using the wrong word.

Do you recommend the song? Type in the input box. Write 100-120 words. Use your own words where possible. Response: I recently listened to a song called ""Home Improvement"" by Josh Woodward. Unfortunately, I didn’t enjoy it. The melody felt quite dull to me, and the beat was rather irritating. On top of that, the singer’s voice didn’t seem to match the overall tone of the music, it felt out of place and disconnected from the instrumental. Honestly, everything about the song came across as boring to me. The only thing I found somewhat redeeming was the lyrics, as I generally appreciate songs that tell a story.

Response: In a modern aircraft, the main components, which are also easily recognizable from the outside, are:

The cockpit
The wings
The landing gear
The flaps
The fuselage
the tail empennage.
The cockpit is the front of the aircraft, the cockpit where the pilot and co-pilot command the aircraft. This is the brain of the aircraft, which has all the necessary instrumentation to direct the flight and communicate on the ground.

Most airplane wings have a curved top surface and a flatter bottom surface, creating what is referred to as a ""streamline."" This affects the speed of the plane, because it generates more or less air resistance: in fact, for an airplane to fly, a force must be generated that can balance its weight and therefore keep it in the air. Precisely the lift and is generated by the wings.

Two training companies were investigated and analyzed. TrainQuick and Skills Pro.

TrainQuick is cheap and flexible. However, their courses are not being used in the other branch. Employees do not like being mixed with employees from other branches in their classes. 

Skills Pro is more expensive. Nevertheless, the course content is described as difficult and complex by the employees. However, the course is often finished successfully by the personnel who have taken it. What is more, the course is planned to be expanded soon, including more features and variety to the in-class activities.  

All in all, the recommendation is to go with Skills Pro. Although it is pricey, the quality is top notch and is considered as a high priority by the employees and managers.

Hi,

What a crazy week it's been for me. As you know, my work has been one of my major stressors, especially with the new management. They don't seem to understand how to motivate their staff, and when we do a good job, they don't acknowledge us. I'm not sure how much longer I can work here.

Also, do you remember Tia, the girl I met in the coffee shop a few months ago? Well, things aren't going well between us, and I think we might end the relationship. That's got me feeling really down because I thought it was going well for a while.

Sorry for bothering you with this – I've got no one else to talk about this, and I just needed to vent. You always seem to be so calm and in control; maybe you have some advice for me on how I can deal with these problems?

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Having lived in Spain for 2 years attempting to learn Spanish as a second language, one of the biggest challenges to language learning that I found was overcoming the embarrassment of coming across to Spanish people as ""the fool"" in a conversation. With all my study, and time and effort put into learning the language, I would still not comprehend the deeper meaning and function of what people were saying. I might miss one or two words. There was always a delay in processing the information as my brain had to work twice as hard. This resulted in not being able to fully express myself in everyday interactions. It was a blow to my self-confidence and I started to believe that I lacked the necessary mental capabilities to learn a second language. It is hard to go from being generally well-educated and somewhat intelligent, and being socially adept in your first language to having to be like a child in another language, especially if you have fully immersed yourself in the other language's culture and society. In the end, when I look back, it was really just a matter of applying the wrong methods to language learning. Some things were done right, but I missed out on a few key principles. 
The key is to be aware of these obstacles and realize that every language learner faces the same challenges. You are not alone. Nothing is impossible. There is always another way to get around a problem. If something blocks your path, just go around it, and keep pushing ahead. If you work at it for long enough you'll find effective methods which work, and then it's just a matter of applying them.

Start with a concise introduction of the hotel. Mention the renowned FutureArc Agency that designed the hotel, and that it's designed to serve many needs - weekend getaways, business travel, meetings, etc.

Give a few more details about the hotel's highlights that may appeal to different customers.

the perfect location close to the heart of the city, convenient transport and nearby cultural attractions. Tourists would love this.

classy lounge and restaurant – a great choice for business travelers if they need to meet with partners or clients

spacious and well-equipped meeting space - can handle conferences and conventions

Come up with a tagline. The message is that every stay is different but memorable.
I'd like to have a draft of the promotional leaflet by the end of the week. Then we can get the design team to work on the layout. We'll also add some testimonials from reviewers later.

After that, I'll talk about our profit and our market share.
To wrap up, I'll hold a Q and A session.

To kick off, Frisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko, I'm not sure if any of you know this, Bill was on a sea voyage, on that voyage a storm happened and he fell into the sea and was lost for a few hours, during that time a shark attacked him and injured him, very scared and terrified, he asked God for help, soon a ship appeared and saved him, this inspired him to start his own ship company.
after that the company grew, locations in 20 cities all over the world, more than 5,000 employees.
 
Let's change gears, if I can draw your attention to  the pie chart, our profit of 5 million dollars last year and 10 percent of the global market.

To comclude, I'm going to do a little quiz

when was founded the  Frisko Shipping?

how bill got the idea to found  the  Frisko Shipping?

What was our market share last year?

How many employees does Frisco Shipping have?

That concludes my presentation, thank you for Listening.

Response: On June 13, 2010, InterStar Airways Flight 293 landed safely at San Francisco International Airport with its nose wheels turned 90 degrees. The flight, which was originally headed from Oakland to Phoenix, encountered an error message related to the nose landing gear shock absorber shortly after departure. Diverting first to San Jose for a visual check, it was confirmed that the nose gear was misaligned. The captain then chose San Francisco for landing due to its longer runway and better emergency services. To reduce landing weight, the plane flew for several hours to burn fuel. The captain instructed the cabin crew on emergency procedures, advising evacuation from the rear if necessary. During the landing, the aircraft's tires deflated but the plane remained on the runway centerline. No injuries occurred, and passengers deplaned normally.

I have a problem I'd like your help with. I know what a creative writer you are. Could you take a look at the text below and rewrite it for me to make it more interesting? Here's the text:

Dear colleague,

This is to inform you of an upcoming change in company policy. Starting on the first Monday of next month, the company will be providing free breakfasts to all employees. We hope this will be a way to lessen the stress of trying to grab something to eat before getting to work, and also give us all a chance to socialize a bit before we start our day.

We're very pleased with our menu. We will be offering fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, bagels and doughnuts every day. In addition, we will have one hot item each day. This could be anything from scrambled eggs and potatoes to pancakes with maple syrup. We will also be offering fresh-brewed coffees and teas, along with fresh-squeezed orange and grapefruit juices.

I'd like everyone to be as excited as I am, and I'm hoping that, with your help and creativity, this new policy will be a big success.

Thanks for your help.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: The landing gear should be retracted after liftoff when the airplane has reached an altitude where the airplane could no longer be landed on the runway if there is a power failure.
Landing gear is extended by placing the gear selector switch in the GEAR DOWN position.
The airspeed will decrease and the pitch attitude may increase.
During the several seconds it takes for the gear to extend, the pilot should be attentive to any abnormal sounds or feel.
The pilot should confirm that the landing gear has extended and locked by the normal sound and feel of the system operation as well as by the gear position indicators in the cockpit.
In most airplanes, the gear switch is shaped like a wheel in order to facilitate positive identification and to differentiate it from other cockpit controls.
A landing gear safety switch, sometimes referred to as asquat switch, is usually mounted in a bracket on one of the main gear shock struts.
The pilot should then turn on thebattery master switch and ensure that the landing gear position indicators show that the gear is down and locked.

Project:

Information Technology using RFID

Prepared for: Better Logistics Ltd.

Prepared by: Lauren Stewart, TriLogistics Inc.

Description:

An automated program equipped with RFID Technology

Proposal Number: 33430921

Objective:

To create an automated program to facilitate the use of tags in tracking the situation, route, destination and contents of a product, including where the product is, where it has been and its expiration date. The logistics sector is perfectly positioned as one of the primary beneficiaries of the adoption of RFID into the supply chain.

We will be keeping in mind all possible present and future scenarios and carefully analyzing and implementing forecasts on the behalf of the client.

• Cost-effective
• Complete database
• A range of tracking applications
• Cutting edge but easy-to-implement technology

Opportunity:

Our company will build a secure database located at an information storage facility. The information can be read by any computer with access to the internet and with no special software required. RFID tagging represents a great opportunity to expand a company’s portfolio of services rendered. These opportunities include:

• Performing inspections
• Viewing and printing inspection certificates
• Recording inventories
• Tracking assets
• Lowering inventory stock levels
• Reducing manual checks
• Reducing logistics costs
• Providing RFID compliance services to clients 
• Expanding service and revenue bases to suppliers Correction: <input>TriLogistics Inc.<code a=""PHRA"" c="" "">

The crew saw error messages about the nose landing gear and steering.
They flew by the control tower in San Jose, which confirmed the nose wheels were facing the wrong way.
The captain chose San Francisco for landing due to its better emergency support and longer runway.
To make the landing safer, the crew flew around to burn fuel and reduce weight.
Passengers were told about the gear issue and evacuation plans in case of an emergency.
