"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: Corporate social responsibility is no longer a philanthropic afterthought, it is a strategic necessity in todays interconnected world. As companies grow in influence, their impact on society, the environment, and the economy becomes more pronounced. Corporate social responsibility recognises that business are not isolated economic units, but integral parts of the community they serve. 
As its core, Corporate social responsibility is about accountability, it challenges companies to go beyond profit making and consider the broader implications of their actions. Whether its reducing carbon emissions, ensuring ethical behaviours and labore practices, or inverting in the community development, socially responsible companies build trust and long term values, This in turn enhances brand reputations, attracts top talent, and secures customer loyalty.
Moreover, Corporate social responsibility  is not just morally sound, it makes business sense. consumers are increasingly aligning their spending with their values and investors are prioritizing environmental social and governance factors. A company that neglects Corporate social responsibility risks reputational damage and diminished competitiveness.
In emerging markets, Corporate social responsibility can be a transforming force, corporations have the resources to address systematic challenges such as poverty, inequality, educational gaps often more effectively than goverments.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your friend is about to open a secondhand clothes shop. He doesn’t have much capital, and is renting a very old building. He has got a few quotes for property and liability insurance, but they have been very high. He asks you to do a risk assessment of the premises. Have a look at your checklist, then write him an email advising him of the changes he has to make. Write 150-200 words. Response: Hi Friend,

I’ve gone through the risk assessment for your secondhand clothes shop, and based on the checklist, here are a few changes you can make to help lower your property and liability insurance premiums.

Building Condition: Since the building is old, it might be increasing your premiums. Consider investing in some basic repairs, especially for plumbing and electrical systems. Insurance companies often view buildings with outdated infrastructure as higher risks.

Security: Installing security systems like an alarm, CCTV, and better locks will lower the risk of theft and vandalism. Many insurers offer discounts for properties with enhanced security measures.

Fire Safety: Adding fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, and possibly sprinklers could help reduce the risk of fire-related claims. These improvements may also make your insurance premiums more manageable.

Liability Coverage: Since the building is older, consider limiting your liability coverage to match the size and layout of the premises. If possible, raise your deductible to reduce premiums.

Let me know if you need help coordinating any of these changes!

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: You're going to write about an interesting, fictional event that happened to a friend. Write your blog post. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Last weekend, my friend Miguel had an interesting encounter during his hike in the hills that are near our town. As he was following one of his usual trails, he saw a path he hadn't seen before, covered by overgrown bushes. Very intrigued, Miguel decided to explore the new route.
The path led to a small clearing where Miguel found an old, weathered bench. It looked like it hadn't been used in years, but it offered a perfect spot to sit and enjoy the surroundings. While resting there, Miguel  noticed a bird's nest in the branches above, filled with chirping baby birds. He watched them for a while, fascinated by the miracle of nature.
After the little break, Miguel continued down the trail, which eventually looped back to a part of the forest he recognized. On his way back, he chatted with a fellow hiker who mentioned that the bench was part of a forgotten birdwatching spot that locals used to visit years ago.
Alex returned home with a renewed appreciation for the small surprises nature can offer.

The flight, which was originally headed from Oakland to Phoenix, encountered an error message related to the nose landing gear shock absorber shortly after departure. Diverting first to San Jose for a visual check, it was confirmed that the nose gear was misaligned. The captain then chose San Francisco for landing due to its longer runway and better emergency services. To reduce landing weight, the plane flew for several hours to burn fuel. The captain instructed the cabin crew on emergency procedures, advising evacuation from the rear if necessary.

Response: There has been lot of legends about so many creatures which look unreal but people talk about it in different forums. Movies and TV series were made adding some more fiction to these legends. Though I have not sighted any of these creatures but I am always fascinated by the fact that Dinosaurs existed some thousands of years ago. It all started when I watched the movie Jurassic Park.

Even till today I keep reading different material on the internet which talks about the dinosaurs. I wonder how this creatures survived in those times like did they had enough food to eat, move around and more importantly how did human if they existed during that times survived from these creatures. It also makes me wonder how so many animals became extinct but human race only prospered and increased in numbers. How they were able to rule the world.

Coming back to the dinosaurs, so far the proofs that we have only suggest there might be some large animals that existed but that there is no proof that they would have been so large as they show in some movies and also if they were so dangerous at all.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Review your notes and write a case report stating who was found guilty and why. Briefly comment on whether you found the verdict appropriate. Write 150-200 words. Response: In this case, the plaintiffs, the Byron family, filed a tort action for trespassing against Medina. According to their account, Medina unlawfully entered their home at night, causing severe distress and fear. Although there were claims that valuables might have been taken, no specific items were mentioned. The defendant argued that he believed the house was empty, was scared, and only sought temporary shelter. However, it was confirmed that Medina ransacked various areas of the home, intensifying the sense of threat experienced by the family. The court ruled that Medina’s actions constituted criminal trespassing. As a result, he was fined 1,000 monetary units, to be paid in two installments—one immediately. Additionally, the court sentenced Medina to 300 hours of community service. The verdict underscores the seriousness of unlawful entry, even when no physical harm is caused, especially when it results in emotional trauma to the occupants.

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Language learning is a rewarding but often challenging journey. Students frequently face difficulties that range from pronunciation struggles to mastering grammar and vocabulary retention. One common issue is overcoming the fear of making mistakes. Many learners hesitate to speak because they worry about errors, which can hinder their progress. Confidence-building exercises, such as practicing with native speakers or engaging in conversations, help students gain fluency.

Another challenge is understanding cultural nuances. Language is deeply tied to culture, and learners may struggle with idioms, slang, or expressions that don’t directly translate. Exposure to authentic materials, such as movies, books, and conversations, enhances cultural comprehension.

Additionally, memorizing vocabulary and grammar rules can be daunting. Rote learning often fails to stick, so students benefit from active learning techniques, such as writing practice, using words in context, and spaced repetition systems.

Consistency is also crucial—many learners start with enthusiasm but struggle with maintaining a regular study schedule. Setting achievable goals and incorporating language learning into daily routines can help sustain progress. 

By addressing these challenges with patience and persistence, students can improve their proficiency and enjoy the process of mastering a new language.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a criticism of a celebrity. It can be a particular celebrity or the whole idea of celebrity in general. Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The new stream celebrities, or what they like to call themselves “influencers,” are one big failure. People with little knowledge of the world have built their fame on playing games, testing things, or reviewing food.  They often express their opinions on political or worldview issues, thus shaping young people's perceptions of the world. Unfortunately, nowadays, all you need is a phone with a camera and an idea of “gaining a reach” to become a “modern-day celebrity.”

The pursuit of content reach and monetization has also led to the trivialization of some behaviors that were once considered obscene or inappropriate just a few years ago. What might have been disapproval or embarrassing in the past is now often normalized by online idols. Rather than educating or inspiring young audiences, many influencers focus on gaining popularity and maximizing reach, often at the expense of ethics and social responsibility. These media-savvy individuals exploit their platforms for publicity, creating crass publicity stunts that keep them in the spotlight they desperately crave.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Write a summary of no more than 50-60 words about the case. Use the words below. This is a non-graded activity. Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.

In the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.

During the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.

Dear Mr. Samson,

Below are the results of the surveys you requested, which were conducted in Rio de Janeiro and Shanghai.

To summarize our method: we took a sample covering all the demographics and asked how they felt about the collarless dress shirt.

Collarless dress shirt: facts and figures

Interviewed:

Rio de Janeiro – 1000

Shanghai – 1000

Rio de Janeiro:

Approve: 35% (would buy: 20%)                  Not approve: 65%

Shanghai:

Approve: 80% (would buy: 40%)                   Not approve: 20%

For the 65% in Rio and the 20% in Shanghai, it is not a highly desirable item for several reasons:

design

size

color

material

For the 20% in Rio and the 40% in Shanghai who 'would buy,' they expressed moderate satisfaction. Some factors that kept them from feeling strongly satisfied:

Before launching, not enough market research carried out

Good idea, bad execution

General feeling is that diversity was not considered in product design

Moving forward, this is what we should consider:

More research: what men want and need in an accessory

Design: more attention to detail, e.g. stitching color

Size: slim fitting

Colors: strong primary colors; black and white

Material: wrinkle-free and/or sweat absorbent

Changes for Rio are a priority, because Asia results are satisfactory Correction: <input>From<code a=""DET"" c="" "">_</code><code a=""PHRA"" c=""To "">

"Prompt Level: 12.0 Prompt: Write about how to develop leadership qualities. You can write about personal experiences or what you have seen happen in others. What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. Response: 



Developing leadership qualities involves a combination of self-awareness, communication skills, and continuous learning. To start, leaders must develop emotional intelligence by recognizing their own emotions and understanding others' feelings. This helps in building strong, empathetic relationships. Effective communication is crucial, as it ensures leaders can convey ideas clearly, listen actively, and inspire teams.

A good leader also demonstrates decision-making abilities, balancing risks and rewards, and taking responsibility for outcomes. Problem-solving skills are key, as leaders often face challenges that require creative solutions. Additionally, strong leaders are adaptable and open to feedback, constantly striving to improve themselves and their teams.

Developing leadership also includes fostering teamwork, providing mentorship, and encouraging others to take initiative. By setting an example of integrity, resilience, and accountability, leaders build trust and create a positive, motivating environment. Ultimately, leadership development is a lifelong journey of growth and self-improvement.

Response: The main parts of an airplane include fuselage, wings, engine, tail and landing gear.

The fuselage is the body where the passengers are located but also the cargo and the plane crew.
The wings help the airplane to fly. They help to move forward and to generate lift to go up and down. They have flaps that help to control speed.
The cockpit is where the pilot is and where all the necessary stuff is located to control the airplane. Things like flight instruments, communications radio, and the seating area are part of this part.
The airplane engine is the power source. This is an electric engine that needs fuel normally located inside the wings.
The tail located at the rear position provides stability and direction.
Landing gear is used for takeoff and landing or during taxi. They have wheels and have a retractable system.
For monitoring using radars, the transponder is the mechanism to transmit and receive signals to determine position and altitude.

Response: Last weekend, my friend Lila experienced something so strange, she still isn’t sure it was real. She had gone on a solo hike in the Lakewood Forest, a peaceful place known for its quiet trails and occasional deer sightings. About halfway through her hike, Lila spotted an old stone well she swore hadn’t been there before. Curious, she walked up to it and looked inside—expecting darkness or maybe some water. Instead, she saw what looked like a flickering campfire deep below, and she heard faint music, like a violin playing an old tune.

Before she could react, a gust of wind blew through the trees, and a folded piece of parchment flew out of the well, landing at her feet. It had no writing, just a strange symbol: a key inside a circle. When she looked back into the well, everything was gone—no fire, no music. Just darkness.

Lila hiked back, feeling uneasy but strangely thrilled. She still has the parchment and is determined to find out what the symbol means. Was it a prank? A portal? We don’t know—but it’s a mystery worth chasing.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: An airplane consists of several key parts that work together to ensure it can fly safely and efficiently. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane, providing space for passengers, cargo, and the cockpit where the pilots control the aircraft. It also serves as a structural frame that holds the other parts in place.

The wings are crucial for flight. They generate lift by moving air faster over the top surface than the bottom, creating an upward force that allows the plane to stay in the air. The shape and angle of the wings are carefully designed to provide the most efficient lift.

The tail of the airplane, also known as the empennage, consists of the horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer helps to keep the plane level and prevent pitching, while the vertical stabilizer controls the plane’s yaw, or side-to-side movement.

Finally, the engines provide the thrust needed for the airplane to move forward. Most commercial airplanes use jet engines that take in air, compress it, mix it with fuel, and then expel it at high speed to propel the aircraft forward.

Each of these parts works together to ensure the airplane can fly smoothly and safely.

Include an introduction, a body (with signposting phrases, where possible), an anecdote and a call to action. Write 150–250 words. Response: Good morning everyone, and welcome to Frisko Shipping!

I’m excited to have the opportunity to introduce you to our company today. I know you’ve all come here with great enthusiasm and a desire to be part of something special, and I can promise you, Frisko Shipping is exactly that. But don’t just take my word for it—let’s dive into the story behind our global success and see why you’re joining a team that’s truly exceptional.

Let me begin with a brief history.
Frisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko, a visionary with a passion for global trade. What started as a small shipping company has now grown into a powerhouse with locations in 20 cities across the world. With over 5,000 employees, we’ve built an international network that moves millions of goods every day, connecting markets and communities in ways that many companies only dream of.

Last year, we achieved a profit of 5 million dollars and captured 10% of the global market. It’s an impressive track record, and it reflects the dedication of every person who has worked here—and now, that includes you!

But it’s not just about the numbers. We believe that people are at the heart of everything we do. We want you to bring your enthusiasm, your motivation, and your drive to the table. New employees like you are expected to bring fresh ideas and energy into the company, and in return, we promise you’ll be part of a company that values growth, creativity, and a strong sense of teamwork.

Now, let me share an anecdote about Bill Frisko himself.
Many of you may already know that Bill’s journey to founding Frisko Shipping wasn’t a typical one. In fact, it was an experience that could’ve been the end of his career. On one of his early adventures, Bill fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. But rather than letting this life-changing moment defeat him, Bill saw it as a sign to make a change. In fact, the very ship that rescued him became the inspiration for the birth of Frisko Shipping. Bill often says that you can find inspiration in the most unexpected places—even in the middle of a life-threatening situation. And that’s the kind of mindset we value here. Anything can happen, and with the right perspective, it can lead to incredible opportunities.

Before I finish, I want to make sure you’re thinking ahead—not just about what Frisko Shipping is today, but about what we can become together. So, here’s a little challenge for you: How much do you really know about the company you’ve just joined? I’d like to kick things off with a fun quiz to see how many facts you’ve already picked up. It’s a great way to test your knowledge and get you even more excited about being a part of our journey.

In conclusion, as you step into your new roles, remember that you’re not just joining a company—you’re joining a movement. A movement that began with a spark of inspiration and has grown into something truly global. So, let’s work together, think outside the box, and continue to build on the foundation of success that we’ve all worked so hard to create.

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Language students often encounter a variety of issues and challenges that can impede their learning process. What are the most common difficulties they face, and how can these be addressed?

Firstly, language learners frequently struggle with pronunciation and accents. The phonetic differences between their native language and the target language can lead to misunderstandings and communication barriers. This challenge can be mitigated through practice and exposure to native speakers, as well as utilizing language learning tools that focus on pronunciation.

Another significant issue is the complexity of grammar and syntax. Language students often find it difficult to grasp the rules and structures of a new language, which can be vastly different from their own. To overcome this, learners can benefit from structured lessons and exercises that incrementally build their understanding, alongside practical application in conversations and writing.

Vocabulary acquisition is also a hurdle, as memorizing and retaining new words can be overwhelming. Students can address this challenge by using mnemonic devices, engaging in immersive experiences, and employing spaced repetition techniques to reinforce memory.

Additionally, cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions pose challenges, as language is deeply intertwined with culture. Students may struggle to understand context or use language appropriately. Exposure to authentic materials such as films, books, and interactions with native speakers can help bridge this gap.

Finally, motivation and confidence are crucial yet fragile elements. Language learning is a long-term commitment that requires perseverance. Encouragement from peers, setting achievable goals, and celebrating small victories can sustain motivation and boost confidence.

In summary, language students face numerous challenges, but with strategic approaches and consistent effort, these obstacles can be overcome, leading to successful language acquisition. Correction: <input>Language students often encounter a variety of issues and challenges that can impede their learning process. What are the most common difficulties they face, and how can these be addressed?

Firstly, language learners frequently struggle with pronunciation and accents. The phonetic differences between their native language and the target language can lead to misunderstandings and communication barriers. This challenge can be mitigated through practice and exposure to native speakers, as well as utilizing language learning tools that focus on pronunciation.

Another significant issue is the complexity of grammar and syntax. Language students often find it difficult to grasp the rules and structures of a new language, which can be vastly different from their own. To overcome this, learners can benefit from structured lessons and exercises that incrementally build their understanding, alongside practical application in conversations and writing.

Vocabulary acquisition is also a hurdle, as memorizing and retaining new words can be overwhelming. Students can address this challenge by using mnemonic devices, engaging in immersive experiences, and employing spaced repetition techniques to reinforce memory.

Additionally, cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions pose challenges, as language is deeply intertwined with culture. Students may struggle to understand context or use language appropriately. Exposure to authentic materials such as films, books, and interactions with native speakers can help bridge this gap.

Finally, motivation and confidence are crucial yet fragile elements. Language learning is a long-term commitment that requires perseverance. Encouragement from peers, setting achievable goals, and celebrating small victories can sustain motivation and boost confidence.

In summary, language students face numerous challenges, but with strategic approaches and consistent effort, these obstacles can be overcome, leading to successful language acquisition.</input>",43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a,15.0,5,5,0,True,0.611,"{'Score 0': 0.0018, 'Score 1': 0.0027, 'Score 2': 0.0064, 'Score 3': 0.0626, 'Score 4': 0.3157, 'Score 5': 0.6108}"

In the 80s, I used to read magazines or books that I bought from libraries. Nowadays, I have my own laptop and can read magazines on demand all the time if I want.
Media has changed my personal life because now I can find free time to do many things that I enjoy, such as reading cookbooks and trying different dishes on my own. I can watch movies on my laptop no matter where I am, as long as the internet works. I love this invention, which gives me enormous opportunities to read news, magazines, e-books and much more.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: My favorite city in Argentina is Buenos Aires, a bustling metropolis known for its European-style architecture, vibrant culture, and passionate tango dance. This dynamic city is contrasted sharply with the serene and awe-inspiring natural beauty of Patagonia. Buenos Aires, often referred to as the “Paris of South America,” is a city that never sleeps. Its streets are filled with lively cafes, historic theaters, and grand avenues. The neighborhoods, such as Palermo and San Telmo, each have their unique charm, offering a blend of old-world elegance and modern vibrancy.

Then, there is Patagonia, a region located at the southern end of South America, shared by Argentina and Chile. Patagonia is renowned for its dramatic landscapes, including the towering Andes mountains, vast glaciers, and stunning national parks like Los Glaciares and Torres del Paine. Unlike the urban excitement of Buenos Aires, Patagonia offers a tranquil and remote experience where nature’s grandeur takes center stage.

While Buenos Aires captivates with its rich cultural heritage, architectural beauty, and lively atmosphere, Patagonia enchants with its pristine wilderness, breathtaking scenery, and opportunities for adventure and exploration. Buenos Aires' charm lies in its ability to blend history, culture, and modernity seamlessly, creating a city that is both cosmopolitan and deeply rooted in tradition. In contrast, Patagonia’s allure is its untouched landscapes and the sense of peace and wonder they invoke. Together, these two destinations highlight the diverse experiences that Argentina has to offer, from the vibrant city life in Buenos Aires to the serene natural wonders of Patagonia.

A true leader takes ownership of their actions and decisions, even when things go wrong.

Confidence is also important, but it should come with humility. Some of the most respected leaders I know admit when they don’t know something and ask for help. I’ve personally grown as a leader by stepping out of my comfort zone, learning from mistakes, and being open to feedback.

I’m Ticiana, and it’s a pleasure to welcome you to Frisko Shipping. Today, I’d like to share a bit about our company’s journey and what makes us a unique and exciting place to work.

Frisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko. What started as a small venture has now grown into a global powerhouse with locations in 20 cities around the world and more than 5,000 dedicated employees. Last year, we achieved a remarkable profit of 5 million dollars and captured 10 percent of the global market.

But beyond the numbers, what truly sets us apart is our team. We expect our new employees to be motivated and enthusiastic, ready to contribute to our ongoing success.

Let me share a personal story about Bill Frisko, our founder. Many of you might not know this, but Bill’s inspiration to start Frisko Shipping came from a life-changing experience. He once fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. Miraculously, a passing ship saved his life. This event sparked his passion for shipping and led to the creation of our company. It’s a powerful reminder that inspiration can come from the most unexpected places.
As you embark on this journey with us, I encourage you to think about what inspires you and how you can bring that passion to your work here at Frisko Shipping. Let’s make waves together and continue to drive our company forward.

Let me share a personal story about Bill Frisko, our founder. Many of you might not know this, but Bill’s inspiration to start Frisko Shipping came from a life-changing experience. He once fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. Miraculously, a passing ship saved his life. This event sparked his passion for shipping and led to the creation of our company. It’s a powerful reminder that inspiration can come from the most unexpected places.<code a=""PHRA"" c=""

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become an integral part of modern business practices, reflecting a company's commitment to ethical behavior, sustainable development, and community engagement. The postings on this topic reveal a spectrum of opinions, ranging from enthusiastic support to skeptical criticism.

Proponents argue that CSR initiatives foster a positive public image, enhance customer loyalty, and attract top talent. Companies like Patagonia and Ben & Jerry's are often cited as exemplars, demonstrating that ethical practices can coexist with profitability. These businesses have successfully integrated environmental stewardship and social equity into their core operations, proving that CSR can be a win-win strategy for both the company and society.

Critics, however, contend that CSR is often a facade, a marketing gimmick designed to distract from less savory business practices. They point to instances where companies engage in ""greenwashing,"" promoting environmentally friendly initiatives while continuing harmful practices behind the scenes. This skepticism underscores the need for transparency and accountability in CSR efforts.

In my view, CSR is not just a moral imperative but a strategic necessity in today's interconnected world. Companies wield significant influence and resources, and with that comes the responsibility to contribute positively to society. Effective CSR requires genuine commitment, clear goals, and measurable outcomes. It should be embedded in the company's culture and operations, rather than being treated as an afterthought or a mere public relations tool.

Ultimately, the true measure of CSR's success lies in its impact. When done right, CSR can drive meaningful change, fostering a more sustainable and equitable world while also benefiting the business itself. Therefore, companies should strive to move beyond superficial gestures and embrace CSR as a core component of their identity and strategy.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: In my country, Brazil, buying a home and applying for a home loan can be a challenging and time-consuming process. First, property prices in major cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are quite high, especially in central or well-developed neighborhoods. For many people, buying a house without a loan is almost impossible, so most rely on financing options offered by banks or government programs like “Minha Casa, Minha Vida.”

The process of applying for a home loan usually involves a lot of paperwork. Applicants must provide proof of income, employment history, tax returns, identification documents, and sometimes even a credit history report. The bank will carefully evaluate the borrower’s financial situation before approving the loan.

Interest rates in Brazil tend to be higher than in some other countries. They usually range from 8% to 12% per year, depending on the applicant’s profile, the chosen bank, and the loan term. Recently, government incentives and lower Selic rates have slightly reduced mortgage rates, but they are still considered expensive.

Using a real estate agent is not required, but many people choose to work with one to help find suitable properties and negotiate with sellers. Some also use mortgage brokers to assist with the loan process. Overall, buying a home in Brazil requires patience, financial planning, and good organization to handle all the required steps and documents.

After comparing the Geothermal Fluxcapacitor XZ3 and the E-series model, I recommend launching the XZ3 design for next year’s release. The XZ3 features a more powerful 6.4-liter V8 engine, accelerating from zero to 60 mph in just 2.7 seconds, compared to the E-model’s 5.7 seconds. It also reaches a higher top speed of 207.1 mph and offers a longer 107.1-inch wheelbase, providing greater stability at high speeds.

While the E-model is electric and more eco-friendly, the XZ3’s superior traction, transmission, and aerodynamics make it the better high-performance vehicle. Its bold red design also gives it a sportier, more aggressive look that appeals to performance-focused drivers.

For a successful and exciting launch, we should choose the XZ3. It offers the kind of thrilling performance and sleek design that defines our brand.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: Use the information in the notes to write an informative text about NAFTA, or write about a trade agreement your country is a part of. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a landmark trade pact signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, which came into effect on January 1, 1994. NAFTA aimed to eliminate most tariffs and trade barriers between the three countries, creating one of the largest free-trade zones in the world. The agreement was inspired by the success of the European Economic Community and sought to boost economic growth and job creation through increased trade and investment.

NAFTA's main provisions included the gradual reduction of tariffs, customs duties, and other trade barriers over a period of up to 15 years. This allowed for duty-free access to a wide range of goods and services, fostering economic integration among the member countries. The agreement also included side agreements on labor and environmental standards to address concerns about the potential negative impacts of increased trade.

Despite facing significant opposition and political debates, NAFTA was generally seen as beneficial for the North American economies. It facilitated the flow of goods, services, and capital, contributing to economic growth and higher living standards. However, it also had its critics, who argued that it led to job losses in certain industries exposed to trade competition.

In 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which aimed to modernize and update the trade relationship between the three countries.

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Language learning can be a rewarding yet challenging journey. Students often face several issues and challenges that can hinder their progress. 

**What are the common difficulties in language learning?** One major challenge is **pronunciation**. Many students struggle with mastering the sounds and intonation patterns of a new language, which can lead to misunderstandings. **How does grammar affect language learning?** Grammar rules can be complex and different from the student's native language, making it difficult to construct sentences correctly. **What role does vocabulary play?** Building a robust vocabulary is essential, but memorizing new words and their meanings can be overwhelming.

**How do cultural differences impact learning?** Cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions can be confusing and hard to grasp. **What about motivation and confidence?** Maintaining motivation and confidence is crucial; students often feel discouraged by slow progress or fear of making mistakes. **How can practice opportunities be limited?** Limited opportunities to practice speaking with native speakers can impede fluency development.

Addressing these challenges requires patience, consistent practice, and sometimes seeking additional resources or support from teachers and peers.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: Use the information in the notes to write an informative text about NAFTA, or write about a trade agreement your country is a part of. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a major trade pact between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. After lengthy negotiations, it officially came into effect in January 1994. Its main goal was to reduce or eliminate customs duties and other trade barriers between the three countries, thereby encouraging the free flow of goods and services across borders.

NAFTA has had a significant impact on trade relations, particularly in sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. For example, it allowed Mexican fruits and vegetables to enter the U.S. market more easily, benefiting both producers and consumers. It also helped integrate supply chains across North America, making industries more competitive globally.

However, the agreement has not been without controversy. While it created jobs and boosted exports in some regions, it also led to job losses and factory closures in others. Despite these challenges, NAFTA has generally been seen as beneficial for all three member countries, strengthening economic ties and promoting regional cooperation.

We firmly assure you that the rumors about the share price falling are completely unfounded.
It is true that the share price fell two months ago. This happened due to the resignation of the former CEO Greg Johnson. New CEO Harry Levy is now on board, a well-known and respected executive in the construction business. The share price has been restored and has quickly risen to an all-time high.

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: Write a comparison-contrast essay about your favorite city and another place. Use the 'X then Y' structure. Be sure to polish your work before you submit it. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: I am almost 50 years old, and already lived in several cities around the world. From the cold Stockholm in Sweden to the crazy Lima in Peru. I learned different cultures, languages, people… One aspect I love is to understand each place.

For me as a Brazilian, being in a town as Stockholm was amazing, without doubt an unbelievable experience. In downtown you feel like in the middle age, narrow streets, paved with rocks, old lamps. Everything so organized and clean. In the other hand, one thing that has always bugged me was the weather; which can be very cold and with short days, making people quiet and close.

     Likewise the time in Sweden, live in Lima was just wonderful. 
Lima is a Metropolis, with more than 10 million habitants, traffic congestion everywhere, noise of the horns and air pollution. But one of the most extraordinary thing there is people; they are happy, and open to new comers. Another aspect I loved was the culture, inside town there are still well-preserved pyramids and others archaeological sites from civilizations more than thousand years old, pre-Incas. 
And for sure, in Peru there are one of the best foods in the word, it’s just incredible.

Even though there is a clear difference between those cities, it´s important to consider that there are pros and cons in both. And to be able to leave your hometown move abroad you need to focus and enjoy to good aspects of each situation, and don’t be just looking the problems and difficulties.

Hi,

Hope you are doing well!

I just had to share something a bit weird, a little exciting, and honestly kind of hilarious that happened recently.

So picture this. I was on a video call, fully focused, camera on, all professional - until halfway through the meeting, my smart speaker in the background suddenly decided it had something to say. Out of nowhere, it blurted out, ""I didn't quite catch that, could you repeat? - ""In the middle of someone presenting a financial update! I froze. Everyone paused. Then someone said, ""well even the AI is confused about these numbers"".

We all had a good laugh, and it actually turned into a mini icebreaker. Now I double-check that my device are on mute before any call.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response: CSR i.e., Corporate Social Responsibility is basically the responsibility of the organisation towards the society. Due to globalisation, there is a constant expectation from the organisations to promote not national interest but global interest as well. We know that the the organisation uses different resources which belongs to the society, so it is ultimate responsibility of the organisation due give something back to the society as whole, this can be in forms of education, like they can establish different educational institution where the children who are unprivileged can get good education. The organisation can set up hospital where they can provide health services to the needy people free of cost or at nominal fee along with free medicine and other services. The other way to contribute to the society is to build the good infrastructure like roadway or railways which can connect the remote location of the country to the developed cities or metropolitans. While utilising the natural resources it is very important that the organisation should be very careful in considering it adverse effect on the nature which will ultimately will impact the society as a whole in terms of increase in the land, noise or water pollutions. Overall, it is the organisation responsibility to work in a best possible manner to improve the living of standards of the communities around them as well as of the whole world.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: “El Chupacabras,” a legendary creature in Mexican and Latin American folklore, is often described as a vampiric, fearsome predator with a penchant for attacking livestock, especially goats, from which its name “chupa” (suck) and “cabra” (goat) originates. The creature first gained attention in the 1990s following reports of livestock deaths, where animals were found drained of blood with mysterious puncture wounds.

Descriptions of El Chupacabras vary widely, but common characteristics include a reptilian or alien-like appearance, spines or quills along its back, and glowing red or green eyes. It’s typically depicted as either bipedal or with a crouched, menacing stance. Some describe it as the size of a small bear, with rough, grayish-green skin and sharp claws or fangs, adding to its supernatural allure.

Despite numerous sightings and alleged encounters, no scientific evidence has been found to support its existence. However, stories of El Chupacabras continue to spread, fueled by media coverage and local folklore, making it one of Mexico’s most enduring modern legends. Its legacy persists in popular culture, embodying fears of the unknown and unexplained in rural areas.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: You are writing to Harry, a new manager in your company. He wants advice on how to effectively motivate his team and what strategies to avoid. Use the language and strategies you have learned in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: To create a motivated, engaged, and productive workforce, it is vital for leaders to take a strategic approach that aligns employees' personal and professional growth with the company's goals. By incentivizing employees and linking their success directly to the company's achievements, managers can create a sense of ownership and motivation, where individuals feel that their contributions directly impact their rewards and overall success. Additionally, taking an active interest in employees' career development and offering mentorship opportunities fosters a deeper connection between the individual and the organization, ensuring they feel supported in their professional journey. Providing opportunities for ongoing training and skill development ensures that employees are equipped with the tools they need to thrive, creating a culture of continuous improvement. It's equally important to promote a healthy work-life balance by recognizing that employees have lives outside of the workplace, and showing empathy toward their personal commitments will build loyalty and well-being. Listening actively to employees, especially when they raise concerns or express dissatisfaction, not only helps to address potential issues early on but also fosters a culture of trust where employees feel heard and valued. Acknowledging their contributions, celebrating their achievements, and giving credit where it's due motivates individuals to perform at their best. On the flip side, behaviors that demotivate employees, such as disrespecting them, taking credit for their work, losing one's temper, unfairly placing blame, or failing to provide recognition for good work, can severely harm morale, leading to disengagement and decreased productivity. It's essential to remember that the actions and attitudes of leadership directly influence the overall atmosphere within a company, and creating a positive, supportive, and respectful environment is the foundation for achieving long-term success.

On top of that, the singer’s voice didn’t seem to match the overall tone of the music, it felt out of place and disconnected from the instrumental.

"Prompt Level: 14.0 Prompt: Your boss has asked you to write a formal report recommending a training company. You've chosen Skills Pro. Use your notes to write up the report. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: We recently considered two training companies, TrainQuick and Skills Pro, and here’s a summary of what we found:

TrainQuick: This option is affordable and offers flexible scheduling, making it attractive in terms of cost and convenience. However, there are some challenges. For one, employees in our other branch haven’t been using it very much. Additionally, many employees prefer not to be mixed with individuals from other branches during training, as they feel it disrupts the team dynamic and can lead to less personalized instruction.

Skills Pro: While Skills Pro is more expensive, it offers a higher level of training quality. The course content is described as difficult, but those who complete the course often do so successfully, which speaks to the value of the training. Moreover, Skills Pro plans to expand its offerings, which could provide more comprehensive training options down the line.

After weighing the options, we’re likely to go with Skills Pro. Although it comes at a higher price point, the quality of the courses and the potential for greater long-term value make it the better choice. Quality training is an investment in our employees' skills and, ultimately, our company’s success.

Dear Boss,

I hope this email finds you well. As we look ahead, there are a couple of key challenges that I believe we should be mindful of.

Firstly, increasing competition in our industry could affect our market share. To tackle this, we should focus on differentiating our services through innovation and customer-centric solutions. Strengthening our brand identity will also help maintain customer loyalty.

Secondly, the rapid pace of technological change presents both an opportunity and a threat. We must invest in continuous training for our team to ensure we're using the latest tools efficiently. Moreover, adopting new technologies will help us stay ahead in the market.

I believe addressing these challenges proactively will help secure our future growth and success.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: An airplane has many important parts that help it fly safely and efficiently. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane. It holds the passengers, cargo, and the cockpit where the pilots sit. The fuselage is strong and shaped to reduce air resistance.
The wings are attached to the fuselage and are very important for flying. They create lift, which helps the airplane rise into the air. Wings also have flaps and ailerons that help the pilot control the plane’s movement during takeoff, flight, and landing.
The tail of the airplane includes the vertical and horizontal stabilizers. These parts keep the airplane stable and help control its direction. The vertical stabilizer helps the airplane turn left or right, while the horizontal stabilizer controls the up and down movement.
Finally, the engines provide the power needed for the airplane to move forward. They push or pull the plane through the air and help it gain speed for takeoff and maintain speed during flight.
All these parts work together to make flying possible and safe. Correction: <input>An airplane has many important parts that help it fly safely and efficiently.

Arthur, you've got to be tough. Play the game. You've got to actively participate in all social activities with your team. Praise people and make them feel good about themselves. Ask your managers to be your mentors and tell them their advice is really helpful. And if someone gets in your way, don't hesitate to stab them in the back. It worked for me!

Marty

@Doris: I don't agree at all, except about participating actively in team activities. I think if you treat coworkers well, they'll be good to you. What goes around comes around! Don't get angry or annoyed – get knowledge! If you can, get your manager to mentor you, but be honest about any weaknesses or things you don't know. You want to learn as much as possible. Ask questions, notice how things get done and update your skills.

This article has the objective to explain the agreement done  among North America countries , I  mean USA , Canada and Mexico in order to stablish an economic condition eliminating tariffs in the commercial relations among them. 
I was done in 1994 after long negotiation period. So it was not easy agreement since each country involved hat specific requirements and intentions.
Despite the difficulties and barries the agreement was signed by the membres. It in fact reduced or eliminated customs duties among the members facilitating the customers to have access to products among these countries at  lower prices without tariffs and aditional costs.
It has had a profound effect on trade relations, especially in agriculture; for example, Mexican fruits and vegetables flow into the US. It just one example that came from this agreement but of course it allowed several others advantages in terms of commercial relation. Although the agreement also brought negative points the most points are positive and overall, benefits all three members. In the globalization , this kind of agreement has become more common.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Review your notes and write a case report stating who was found guilty and why. Briefly comment on whether you found the verdict appropriate. Write 150-200 words. Response: Case Overview: This case involves a tort action for trespassing where the plaintiff, Byron, accused the defendant, Medina, of unlawfully entering their home. The incident caused significant distress and terror to the Byron family. It was unclear whether Medina took any valuables, as there was no specific mention of items being stolen.

Details of the Case:

Plaintiff's Position: Medina unlawfully entered the Byron family home, causing distress and terror.
Defendant's Position: Medina claimed he believed the house was empty and was seeking shelter at night. He admitted to ransacking the house in the process.
Verdict: The court found Medina guilty of trespassing, a criminal offense. The penalties imposed included a fine of $1,000, to be paid in two installments, with one payment to be made immediately. Additionally, Medina was sentenced to complete 300 hours of community service.

Commentary on the Verdict: The verdict appears appropriate given the circumstances of the case. Trespassing is a criminal offense, and the court's decision to impose a monetary fine and community service is a reasonable punishment for Medina's unlawful entry and the distress caused to the Byron family. The sentencing takes into account Medina's actions while providing a rehabilitative component through community service, which may deter similar behavior in the future. The fine and community service collectively serve as a punitive measure and a means of restitution for the disturbance caused by the trespass.

Have a look at your checklist, then write him an email advising him of the changes he has to make. Write 150-200 words. Response: Subject: Risk Assessment & Safety Recommendations for Your Shop

Hi [Friend's Name],

I visited the premises and went through a basic risk assessment checklist. There are a few key changes you'll need to make to improve safety and potentially reduce your insurance costs:

Electrical Safety – The wiring looks outdated. Get a certified electrician to inspect and upgrade it if needed.

Fire Safety – Install smoke detectors, a fire extinguisher, and ensure clear access to exits. Consider adding signage.

Trip Hazards – Repair uneven floors and secure any loose rugs or cables to avoid customer injuries.

Lighting – Improve lighting, especially near the entrance and in storage areas, to prevent accidents.

Security – Install basic CCTV and sturdy locks to reduce theft risks, which may also help lower insurance quotes.

Making these changes should not only make the shop safer but may also help bring down those high insurance premiums. Let me know if you want help getting quotes or finding contractors.

I have to tell you about the weirdest thing that happened to me last weekend! So, I decided to take a spontaneous trip to the countryside for some fresh air and relaxation. While exploring a quaint little village, I stumbled upon a local festival. It was vibrant, with colorful decorations, music, and food stalls everywhere.

The highlight of the festival was a quirky contest called ""The Great Sheep Race."" Yes, you read that right—sheep racing! The villagers had these adorable, tiny sheep dressed in little costumes, and they were racing them down a makeshift track. I couldn't stop laughing at the sight of these fluffy racers trotting along, some of them getting distracted by the crowd and wandering off course.

To make it even funnier, they asked for volunteers to be ""sheep cheerleaders."" Guess who ended up waving pom-poms and cheering for a sheep named ""Woolly Wonder""? Yep, that was me! It was such a bizarre yet hilarious experience, and I even won a small prize for being the most enthusiastic cheerleader.

I never thought I'd spend my weekend cheering for sheep, but it turned out to be one of the most memorable and amusing days I've had in a long time. Can't wait to catch up and tell you more about it!

Collarless dress shirt: facts and figures

Interviewed:

Rio de Janeiro – 1000

Shanghai – 1000

Rio de Janeiro:

Approve: 35% (would buy: 20%)                  Not approve: 65%

Shanghai:

Approve: 80% (would buy: 40%)                   Not approve: 20%

For the 65% in Rio and the 20% in Shanghai, it is not a highly desirable item for several reasons:

design

size

color

material

For the 20% in Rio and the 40% in Shanghai who 'would buy,' they expressed moderate satisfaction. Some factors that kept them from feeling strongly satisfied:

Before launching, not enough market research carried out

Good idea, bad execution

General feeling is that diversity was not considered in product design

I am writing to formally recommend the Skill Pro course for those seeking to enhance their professional expertise. As an advanced program in skill development, Skill Pro has established itself as a leader in delivering high-quality education, despite being a more expensive option compared to its counterparts.

The course content of Skill Pro has often been described as challenging, which is a testament to its rigor and comprehensive coverage of the subject matter. This complexity ensures that participants are thoroughly engaged and gain a deep understanding of the skills being taught. Notably, the course is structured in a way that supports and guides students through these challenges, resulting in a high completion rate among participants.

Moreover, Skill Pro's commitment to continuous improvement is evident in their plans to expand the course offerings. This expansion not only promises to cover a broader range of skills but also indicates the program's dedication to adapting to the evolving needs of professionals in various industries.

In conclusion, while Skill Pro may require a greater financial investment, the benefits of its rigorous curriculum and successful completion rates make it a worthwhile endeavor for those seriously committed to advancing their skills and career prospects.

Speech on Partnership Renewal with Crum

Opening:
I’m pleased to announce that we’ve successfully renewed our partnership with Crum, a testament to the strong foundation we’ve built together. This achievement is further highlighted by the positive feedback we received, with Crum specifically praising our dedication to quality.

Body:
However, this milestone was not without its challenges. Three months ago, we faced significant issues with unresolved defects, which impacted our service delivery. In addition to these major concerns, there were minor technical issues that, while less critical, still affected our efficiency.

In response to these challenges, we took decisive action:

We revised our update delivery process, ensuring faster, more reliable deployments.

We enhanced our Quality Assurance procedures, allowing us to identify and address defects more effectively.

Importantly, these improvements were made possible through cross-team collaboration, which played a vital role in aligning our efforts and driving meaningful change.

Closing:
Looking ahead, we’re committed to providing ongoing support to prevent future issues and maintain the high standards our clients expect. Our focus remains on continuous improvement, ensuring that our partnerships continue to thrive.

Response: Subject: Addressing Future Challenges and Solutions

Dear Maksym,

I wanted to share some thoughts on potential future challenges and how we might proactively address them.

Firstly, rapid technological shifts pose a risk. New tools and AI are constantly emerging, and failing to adapt could leave us behind. My suggestion is to implement a continuous learning program, dedicating specific time each month for teams to explore and integrate relevant new technologies.

Secondly, talent retention is crucial. The competitive market means losing key employees can severely impact productivity. To counter this, I propose enhancing our mentorship programs and creating clear, personalized career development paths, ensuring our team feels valued and sees a future here.

These steps could significantly strengthen our position moving forward.

Best regards,

Project:

Information Technology using RFID

Prepared for: Better Logistics Ltd.

Prepared by: Lauren Stewart, TriLogistics Inc.

Description:

An automated program equipped with RFID Technology

Proposal Number: 33430921

Objective:

To create an automated program to facilitate the use of tags in tracking the situation, route, destination and contents of a product, including where the product is, where it has been and its expiration date. The logistics sector is perfectly positioned as one of the primary beneficiaries of the adoption of RFID into the supply chain.

We will be keeping in mind all possible present and future scenarios and carefully analyzing and implementing forecasts on the behalf of the client.

• Cost-effective
• Complete database
• A range of tracking applications
• Cutting edge but easy-to-implement technology

Opportunity:

Our company will build a secure database located at an information storage facility. The information can be read by any computer with access to the internet and with no special software required. RFID tagging represents a great opportunity to expand a company’s portfolio of services rendered. These opportunities include:

• Performing inspections
• Viewing and printing inspection certificates
• Recording inventories
• Tracking assets
• Lowering inventory stock levels
• Reducing manual checks
• Reducing logistics costs
• Providing RFID compliance services to clients 
• Expanding service and revenue bases to suppliers Correction: <input>TriLogistics Inc.<code a=""PHRA"" c="" "">

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: The writing techniques introduced in the preceding units have been invaluable in enhancing my writing skills. Among these techniques, I find metaphor, symbolism, and listing to be particularly useful. Metaphor allows me to create vivid and evocative language, drawing connections between seemingly disparate concepts and adding depth to my writing. Symbolism enables me to convey complex ideas and themes in a subtle yet powerful way, inviting readers to interpret and reflect on the text. Listing, on the other hand, helps me to generate and organize ideas, ensuring that my writing is clear and cohesive.
These techniques complement each other well, and I often find myself using them in conjunction. For instance, I might use listing to brainstorm ideas, and then employ metaphor and symbolism to add richness and nuance to my writing. By incorporating these techniques into my writing practice, I feel more confident in my ability to craft engaging and meaningful texts. Whether I'm writing creatively or academically, these techniques provide me with the tools I need to express myself effectively and connect with my audience.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: Buying a home in India can be both an exciting and challenging experience. The process involves several steps, starting with determining your budget and preferred location. Housing prices vary significantly depending on the city and neighborhood. In metropolitan areas like Mumbai and Delhi, real estate can be quite expensive, whereas smaller cities may offer more affordable options.

Applying for a home loan in India requires thorough preparation. You need to gather documents such as proof of identity, address, income, and employment. The process involves filling out multiple forms and providing detailed financial information. Banks and financial institutions typically offer home loans with interest rates ranging from 7% to 9%, depending on the applicant's credit score and the loan amount.

While it's not mandatory to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker, their expertise can be invaluable. Real estate agents help you find suitable properties and negotiate deals, while mortgage brokers assist in finding the best loan options and navigating the application process. Their services can save time and reduce stress, especially for first-time homebuyers.

Overall, buying a home and securing a home loan in India involves careful planning and attention to detail. With the right preparation and support, it can be a rewarding journey towards owning your dream home. Correction: <input>Buying a home in India can be both an exciting and challenging experience.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Exploring the Charm of Kyoto, Then the Energy of New York City

Kyoto, Japan, is my favorite city because of its serene beauty and deep cultural roots. Walking through Kyoto feels like stepping into a living museum. Ancient temples, peaceful gardens, and traditional tea houses create a calm, reflective atmosphere. The pace of life is slower, encouraging mindfulness and appreciation of small details—like the sound of bamboo rustling or the sight of cherry blossoms falling.

Then there’s New York City, a place that pulses with energy and ambition. Skyscrapers tower over bustling streets, and every corner offers something new—street performers, food trucks, or spontaneous conversations. Unlike Kyoto’s quiet charm, New York thrives on movement and diversity. It’s a city where people chase dreams and where cultures collide in vibrant harmony.

While Kyoto offers peace and tradition, New York offers excitement and innovation. Both cities are unforgettable, but in very different ways. One soothes the soul; the other sparks the imagination. Correction: <input>Exploring the Charm of Kyoto, Then the Energy of New York City

Instead of letting these challenges define us, we used them as a springboard for improvement. We reworked our update delivery process and strengthened our Quality Assurance practices. This progress was only possible because of effective cross-team collaboration. Crum took note of this and made a point to recognize it.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: Use the information in the notes to write an informative text about NAFTA, or write about a trade agreement your country is a part of. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: he North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a landmark trade accord between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which came into effect in January 1994 after years of negotiation. Its primary goal was to eliminate or significantly reduce customs duties and trade barriers among the three member countries, thereby promoting free trade and economic integration across North America.

NAFTA had a profound impact on trade relations, particularly in sectors like agriculture. For example, it facilitated the large-scale export of Mexican fruits and vegetables to the U.S., enhancing food availability and lowering prices. The agreement also encouraged cross-border investments and the development of integrated supply chains, especially in manufacturing and automotive industries.

However, NAFTA’s effects were not uniformly positive. While it boosted overall trade and economic growth, it also led to job displacements in certain industries, particularly in manufacturing sectors in the U.S. and Canada. In Mexico, small-scale farmers faced increased competition from subsidized U.S. agricultural products.

Despite these challenges, NAFTA is widely regarded as beneficial to all three countries, laying the foundation for deeper economic cooperation. It was eventually replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2020, which updated and modernized many of its provisions.

Response: The landing of Cessna 123 encountered several problems that need to be addressed. Firstly, the aircraft experienced a significant delay in touchdown, which resulted in an extended landing roll.  This delay was caused by a malfunction in the landing gear system, which failed to deploy correctly. Additionally, the aircraft's braking system was not functioning optimally, leading to difficulties in slowing down the plane upon landing. The combination of these issues resulted in a challenging and unsafe landing situation. It is recommended that a thorough inspection and maintenance of the landing gear and braking systems be conducted to prevent future occurrences.

Contact: Jorge Ferreira, Creative Manager (jorge.ferreira@ferreira-studio.com) 

Ferreira Studio hereby proposes the design and construction of the Zen Boutique Hotel & Spa, and Health & Fitness Center on Fake Street, CA. The center will provide first-level hotel and spa services as well as gym, health and fitness services. The estimated cost of the project is $37 million. 

Strategic summary 

AccomData Group, which we hired to conduct market research, reported that this project had found a niche in growing trends in weekend getaways to relaxing resorts, greater attention to healthy lifestyle. Their surveys revealed that our target customers, young professionals aged 25 to 40, are unsatisfied with the cuisine in most fitness centers. They highly value healthy menus with top chefs from renowned restaurants. Additionally, they are also attracted to the idea of having fully equipped gyms and swimming pools with trained instructors. 

The construction time is estimated in 2 years. We forecast an almost immediate return on your investment. By the end of Year 2, the forecasted revenue will have a surplus of $1 million, with profits rising to $6 million a year by Year 5. We guarantee that within four years, Capet's Capital will have recouped its investment and start realizing a profit after five years. 

Risk assessment 

Using a reputable insurance company to compile a risk assessment analysis, we've factored any possible economic downturn into our forecasted revenues and profits. If the economy remains stable, the period required for recouping investment and realizing profits could be cut in half. 

We've already engaged Kudos Advertising Agency, who have planned and designed thorough media and advertising coverage. An intensive campaign has been organized to start six months before our grand opening event.  Correction: <input>Proposal submitted to: Martin Sanabria, Sanabria’s Capital

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. Response:   I think that CSR is necessary for companies that aim to continue their activities in each of local community where they are located.  Although some critics may say that the most important thing for a company is to maximize its benefit, not to spend an inconsiderable portion of money relative to its total earnings.  
 But,  the fact that a company is located in a certain area must mean that it consumes various natural resources like, land , air, water, sun light, and that some times it may emit big or small sound or smell in its environment.  
From these considerations, it can be said that the residents around the company 
are almost always anxious about  its activities anticipating that no accidents will occur.  
  Therefore , a company’s existence may be thought to cause at least some stress among the local communities while they are silent.  
In this point, there is a reason for a company to conform to social expectations. The company tries to realize the expectation in a form of CSR.  CSR activities done by companies involved do not only mean soothing the people nearby but also providing them actual job opportunities and revitalizing of the society. The cost coming from the existence of a company and the concrete social benefit through CSR are two-way street.

Hey [Bumba],

I just had the wildest experience at the grocery store today, and I couldn't wait to tell you about it! So, picture this: I'm in the produce aisle, minding my own business, when suddenly a squirrel comes darting across the floor. Yes, a squirrel! It was zig-zagging between the apples and bananas like it was on a mission.

As I stood there, bewildered, one of the store employees rushed over with a broom, trying to gently guide the little critter outside. But the squirrel was having none of it! It jumped onto the cart of an unsuspecting woman who let out a shriek that could have shattered glass. People were laughing and scrambling to get out of its path. It was like a scene straight out of a comedy movie.

Eventually, the squirrel found its way out the automatic doors, leaving behind a trail of amused and confused shoppers. I couldn't help but chuckle all the way home. Who knew grocery shopping could be so entertaining?

Hope you're having a less chaotic day!

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: One legendary creature that fascinates me is the Kitsune from Japanese folklore. Kitsune are fox spirits known for their intelligence and magical abilities. They can shape-shift into human form, often appearing as beautiful women. Kitsune are believed to live for centuries, and as they age, they grow more tails, with the most powerful ones having up to nine tails.

These creatures are often depicted as tricksters, using their cunning to deceive humans. However, they can also be benevolent, serving as guardians and protectors. Kitsune are associated with the Shinto deity Inari, the god of rice, fertility, and prosperity. Inari's foxes are considered messengers and are often seen at shrines dedicated to this deity.

The dual nature of Kitsune—both mischievous and protective—makes them intriguing figures in Japanese mythology. Their stories reflect themes of transformation, wisdom, and the balance between good and evil. Whether as playful tricksters or loyal guardians, Kitsune continue to captivate the imagination and remain a beloved part of Japanese cultural heritage.

Tech issues are a minor problem so we can let them for the rookies to take care of (I’m joking! but also recognizing that each pair of hands are key for the team’s result in this game).

The CRS involves to compromise the companies with the environment and the society. I believe that CRS is a good and important point to improve the future of our planet and our people. 

Nowadays, we live in a consumer society that live in a quick way. Very often, we don't aware of our environment and the proper future. So it is important that the companies have a regulation to take into account the current environment problems like the climate change. CRS performs actions like to reduce the electric maintenance, the energetic efficiency and the sound and light contamination. CRS it also takes in account the well-being of the people like good salaries, workday and working conditions. 

There are some critics that believe CRS is only a stunt to improve their image and consequently their benefits. I understand that it is difficult to think in CRS when we are living in a society where the most important are the results. However, we have to take the courage to fight for these improvements and try to achieve a better planet for everybody.

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Having lived in Spain for 2 years attempting to learn Spanish as a second language, one of the biggest challenges to language learning that I found was overcoming the embarrassment of coming across to Spanish people as ""the fool"" in a conversation. With all my study, and time and effort put into learning the language, I would still not comprehend the deeper meaning and function of what people were saying. I might miss one or two words. There was always a delay in processing the information as my brain had to work twice as hard. This resulted in not being able to fully express myself in everyday interactions. It was a blow to my self-confidence and I started to believe that I lacked the necessary mental capabilities to learn a second language. It is hard to go from being generally well-educated and somewhat intelligent, and being socially adept in your first language to having to be like a child in another language, especially if you have fully immersed yourself in the other language's culture and society. In the end, when I look back, it was really just a matter of applying the wrong methods to language learning. Some things were done right, but I missed out on a few key principles. 
The key is to be aware of these obstacles and realize that every language learner faces the same challenges. You are not alone. Nothing is impossible. There is always another way to get around a problem. If something blocks your path, just go around it, and keep pushing ahead. If you work at it for long enough you'll find effective methods which work, and then it's just a matter of applying them.

Response: Society is increasingly rewarding overhyped representations of celebrities on a global scale, thereby creating a group of bad role models to younger generations of people who look up to such figures for inspiration. Their lack of authenticity or real value is a cause of concern for societies because it is unclear why prominent personalities today are deemed celebrities when they have not had a meaningful impact on society.

What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. Response: Developing leadership qualities is an ongoing process that involves self-knowledge, practice and learning from experiences. Throughout my journey, I have observed and experienced some strategies that can be very effective.

One of the first lessons I learned was the importance of empathy. In a group project in college, I realized that listening to each team member's concerns and ideas not only strengthened our relationship but also led to more creative solutions. When a leader puts himself in others' shoes, he creates an environment of trust and collaboration, essential for the group's success.

Most important quality is emphaty because empathy is an extraordinary quality that brings countless benefits to both personal and professional relationships. When we are empathetic, we are able to put ourselves in someone else's shoes, understanding their emotions, challenges and perspectives. This not only strengthens bonds between people, but also creates an environment of trust and respect.

Not everyone can be a leader, you are responsible for every problem and need to be the center of a reunion

Learning language can be difficult and need a lot of effort for me.
There are many reasons that I feel it difficult. One of the biggest challenges is making time for language learning in my dairy life. There are so many things to do every day, it's hard to study. But, if I want to succeed in language learning, I need to engage intermittently with the language i'm learning.

Another obstacle is fear of making mistakes. I am not confident in the language that I'm learning. So, I tend to hesitate to use it for fear of using the wrong word. It is clear that the shortcut to language improvement is to continue learning without being embarrassed by mistakes. What I should do is just try to put into practice what I have learned.

So, I finally think that learning language has a lot of challenges but I can achieve this by continuing to learn positively.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: The landing gear should be retracted after liftoff when the airplane has reached an altitude where the airplane could no longer be landed on the runway if there is a power failure.
Landing gear is extended by placing the gear selector switch in the GEAR DOWN position.
The airspeed will decrease and the pitch attitude may increase.
During the several seconds it takes for the gear to extend, the pilot should be attentive to any abnormal sounds or feel.
The pilot should confirm that the landing gear has extended and locked by the normal sound and feel of the system operation as well as by the gear position indicators in the cockpit.
In most airplanes, the gear switch is shaped like a wheel in order to facilitate positive identification and to differentiate it from other cockpit controls.
A landing gear safety switch, sometimes referred to as asquat switch, is usually mounted in a bracket on one of the main gear shock struts.

What was the preliminary offer? What happened during the negotiations? What was the final deal? Type in the input box. Write 100-150 words. This activity is non-graded. Response: A recent negotiation I handled at work involved renegotiating a service contract with a vendor. The preliminary offer from the vendor included a standard renewal with a slight price increase. However, after reviewing the service quality and comparing competitors’ rates, I proposed maintaining the existing price while adding performance guarantees.
During the negotiation, both sides exchanged counteroffers. The vendor argued that operational costs had increased, justifying the price hike. I countered by highlighting our long-standing partnership and suggesting a compromise: a small price adjustment, but with additional service benefits included.
After a few discussions, we agreed on a final deal—a moderate price increase, but with enhanced service terms, including faster response times and additional support features. It was a win-win, as the vendor secured a renewal, and we gained better value for our investment.

You won’t believe what happened on Flight 293. Right after takeoff, we got a fault warning for the nose gear shock absorber. After a flyby at San Jose, we confirmed the nose wheels were stuck 90° left. We diverted to SFO for its longer runway and better emergency support.

"Prompt Level: 12.0 Prompt: Write about how to develop leadership qualities. You can write about personal experiences or what you have seen happen in others. What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. Response: Developing leadership qualities is a process that involves self-awareness, consistent practice, and a willingness to grow. One of the most important steps is understanding your strengths and areas for improvement. Great leaders are not born; they are made through experiences, challenges, and reflection.

Key qualities that define a good leader include effective communication, empathy, and decisiveness. For example, a leader who listens to their team and understands their perspectives can build trust and foster collaboration. Decisiveness is equally critical as it demonstrates confidence and the ability to take action even in uncertain situations.

From my experience, leadership skills can be developed through taking responsibility in smaller roles, observing successful leaders, and seeking feedback. For instance, leading a group project at school or work provides opportunities to practice decision-making and teamwork.

I believe everyone has the potential to be a leader in some capacity. Leadership is not limited to managing large teams; it can also mean inspiring others, setting an example, or guiding someone toward a goal. With the right mindset and effort, anyone can develop the qualities needed to lead effectively.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: You see a niche in the hotel market and decide to write a business proposal for investors. Write the **strategic summary** and **risk assessment** sections of the proposal using the notes. Write 140–200 words. Response: Dear Investors,

My name is Sophie B. and I am from the Zen Hotel chain.

Let me introduce you our hotel shortly. 
Zen is a boutique hotel, which is also a spa and a health and fitness center.

The costs which we have to pay is 4,000,000$. I know that sounds pretty much but the hotel will be a very big one so it will be worth it.

Here are some general facts why you should support us:

- The growing trends in weekend getaways o relaxing resorts, greater attention to healthy lifestyle (market research from AccomData Group)

- The unsatisfying cuisine in most fitness centers (survey by AccomData Group)

- The fully equipped gyms and swimming pools with trained instructors

- The construction time will just take two years

- You get the payback in the second year after opening

- We have a projected profit per year after the second year which is about 1,000,000$

- Our estimated time for recouping investment are just 
four years from opening and we will get some profit after the 5th year from opening

Of course there are some risks.

- Any economic downturn has been factored into the above figures.

- If the economy remains stable, the period required for recouping investment and realizing profits could be cut in half.

- intensive media campaign planned by Kudos Advertising Agency

As you can see we put very much of love, money and effort in this big project.

We hope you answer soon.

Thank you for your support.

Write 150-200 words. Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a landmark trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, implemented on January 1, 1994. NAFTA aimed to eliminate trade barriers and tariffs, fostering a trilateral trade bloc in North America. As one of the largest free trade zones in the world, it sought to increase economic integration and cross-border trade among the member countries.

NAFTA significantly impacted the economies of the three nations. It facilitated the flow of goods and services, allowing for the reduction of costs associated with import and export processes. This resulted in expanded markets for businesses and consumers, leading to increased competitiveness and economic growth. However, it also faced criticism for contributing to job losses in certain sectors, particularly in manufacturing, as companies relocated production to countries with lower labor costs.

In 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which built upon its predecessor's framework while addressing contemporary issues such as digital trade, labor rights, and environmental protections. Despite its controversial aspects, NAFTA played a crucial role in shaping economic relationships and trade policies in North America for over two decades.

Based on the notes, prepare one or two points each for the Method, Findings, Conclusions and Recommendations parts of the summary report. Write 100–175 words. Response: Method:
Surveys were conducted in two major cities: Rio de Janeiro and Shanghai, using a sample that represented all key demographics. 
Participants were asked for their opinions on the collarless dress shirt.

Findings:
The responses revealed varied perceptions across regions, but a common theme emerged: the collarless design sparked interest, particularly among younger demographics. 
Some participants associated it with modernity and comfort.

Conclusions:
The collarless dress shirt has potential appeal in diverse markets, especially where fashion trends lean toward minimalism and innovation.
Cultural preferences may influence acceptance rates.

Recommendations:
Further testing in additional cities is advised to validate these findings. 
Marketing strategies should highlight the shirt’s modern attractive and comfort, targeting younger consumers.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your friend is about to open a secondhand clothes shop. He doesn’t have much capital, and is renting a very old building. He has got a few quotes for property and liability insurance, but they have been very high. He asks you to do a risk assessment of the premises. Have a look at your checklist, then write him an email advising him of the changes he has to make. Write 150-200 words. Response: Dear friend,
I hope this email finds you well. Congratulations on your plan to open a secondhand clothes shop! As requested, I've conducted a preliminary risk assessment to help you obtain better quotes for property and liability insurance.
For the exterior of your shop, there are several issues that need addressing:
- Loose bricks
- Blocked drainpipes
- Untidy yard
- Leaky roof
- Cluttered sidewalk
These problems could pose risks to both the structural integrity of the building and the safety of your customers. It would be wise to repair the bricks, clean the drainpipes, tidy the yard, fix the roof leaks, and ensure the sidewalk is clear of clutter.
Regarding the interior of the shop, the following concerns were noted:
- Poor lighting
- Lack of air conditioning
- Stacked boxes
- Old fire extinguishers
- Loose chemicals
Addressing these interior issues is essential for creating a safe and welcoming environment for customers and employees. Improving lighting, installing air conditioning, properly organizing storage, updating fire extinguishers, and safely storing chemicals will not only reduce risk but also enhance the overall shopping experience.
By resolving these issues, you should be able to secure more favorable insurance quotes. Wishing you the best of luck with your new venture!

Persuade your design team to choose one of the designs for next year’s rollout. Write 100-150 words. Response: After comparing the two car designs, Design A stands out as the stronger choice for next year’s rollout. While Design B features bold styling and experimental elements, Design A offers a sleek, modern aesthetic that aligns better with current market trends and customer preferences. Its aerodynamic form not only improves fuel efficiency but also enhances performance. Additionally, Design A uses more sustainable materials, which supports our brand’s commitment to environmental responsibility.

From a production standpoint, Design A is more feasible, with fewer complex components that could delay manufacturing or increase costs. It balances innovation with practicality, making it a smart, forward-looking option.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: In the heart of Indian folklore lies the Naga, a legendary serpent-being revered and feared across the subcontinent. Half-human and half-cobra, Nagas are believed to dwell in deep underground realms, especially beneath rivers, lakes, and sacred mountains. These beings appear throughout Hindu and Buddhist traditions, often as guardians of treasure, nature, or ancient wisdom.
In Hindu mythology, Nagas are descendants of Kashyapa and Kadru and are led by the mighty serpent king Shesha, who coils beneath Lord Vishnu as a divine bed. Another famous Naga, Vasuki, was used as a rope during the churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthan), a pivotal cosmic event.
Nagas are both benevolent and wrathful. They are known to bless those who honor them, yet bring drought or misfortune to those who offend them or desecrate their abodes. In parts of India, particularly in Kerala and Assam, Nagas are worshipped with great reverence, with entire festivals like Nag Panchami dedicated to them.
More than mere myth, the Naga embodies India's deep respect for the natural world and the mysteries that lie beneath the surface, reminding all of the ancient forces still believed to shape the land and its destiny.

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: Write a comparison-contrast essay about your favorite city and another place. Use the 'X then Y' structure. Be sure to polish your work before you submit it. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: When it comes to choosing favorite cities, New York City is always at the top of my list. The Big Apple is a whirlwind of energy, with its iconic skyline, diverse culture, and endless possibilities. It's the kind of place where you can find yourself eating a bagel in Central Park in the morning, visiting the Met in the afternoon, and catching a Broadway show by night. The city is a living, breathing entity, always on the move. The subway system, though sometimes chaotic, is a lifeline that connects the city's vibrant neighborhoods, each with its own unique flavor.

On the flip side, Tokyo offers a completely different but equally captivating experience. The first thing that strikes you about Tokyo is its incredible blend of the ultramodern and the traditional. One moment you're in the neon-lit streets of Shibuya, surrounded by towering digital billboards, and the next, you're in a serene temple in Asakusa, taking in the tranquility. Tokyo’s public transportation is a marvel of efficiency and cleanliness, making it easy to explore every corner of the city. The food scene is another highlight, with everything from world-class sushi to comforting bowls of ramen.

New York and Tokyo are both dynamic cities, but they offer different vibes. New York is all about diversity and cultural richness; it's a place where you can experience the world in a single city. Tokyo, on the other hand, impresses with its seamless integration of cutting edge technology and deeprooted traditions. Each city has its own unique charm and leaves a lasting impression, making them both top destinations on any traveler's list.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: El Coco is a well-known legendary creature often used by parents as a cautionary tale to encourage children to behave.  Parents often use the story of El Coco to scare children so they behave well. The creature is said to come at night to take away disobedient or sleepless children who do not go to bed or who misbehave. Though it is rarely described in detail, El Coco is typically imagined as a dark, shadowy monster that hides in closets or under beds, waiting for the right moment to appear.
El Coco is not always described the same way. Sometimes it looks like a monster with big eyes and sharp teeth. Other times, it is just a shadow or a ghost that hides under the bed or in the closet. Because of this, children are often afraid of the dark.
The story of El Coco has been told for hundreds of years . The legend of El Coco has deep roots in Spain and is passed down from generation to generation. One of the most famous references says: “Duérmete niño, que viene el Coco.” This phrase, which means “Sleep, child, or the Coco will come,” This shows how popular and old the legend is.
Even today, many people in Spain still know about El Coco. It represents a way for adults to teach children the importance of rules and bedtime. Today, El Coco remains a powerful cultural symbol and a reminder of how myths and stories shape behavior and tradition.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, metaphor, symbolism, and questioning stand out as the most useful to me. Metaphor allows for vivid comparisons that breathe life into writing, helping readers connect abstract ideas to tangible imagery. Symbolism, on the other hand, enriches writing by layering deeper meanings beneath the surface, making narratives more engaging and thought-provoking. These techniques are particularly valuable in creative writing, where emotional depth and layered interpretations enhance storytelling.
Additionally, questioning serves as a powerful tool to develop ideas and encourage critical thinking. By asking ""what if"" or ""why,"" writers can push their thoughts further, uncovering fresh perspectives and unexpected angles. This technique is incredibly effective when brainstorming or refining arguments in analytical writing. While free writing and loop writing help generate ideas freely, structured techniques like listing and cubing provide organization, making them useful for planning essays or breaking down complex topics.
Each technique has its own strengths, but the most effective ones depend on the writing purpose and style.

Due to the high amount of projects that our team is currently executing, it is necessary to organize them in a list from the most to the less important, puntualizing the items that must be a priority for us.

US CLIENT DESIGNS
As you all know, this is a high priority project for the company. 
(i) Our US client will work with us again if we do well, which is clearly important as it can have a huge impact on the anual profits.   
(ii) Progress is slow, but we must keep on working daily and making advances.
(iii) All the work untill now has been done perfectly, so we must continue this way.   

NEW HIRES
This project is also important for the company, but still not a priority. 
(i) Two staffers left in Q2.
(ii) We need to find replacements as soon as possible, but still there is a process that we must follow, and it requires time. 
(iii) For this reason, if any of the team members know of anyone, please let me know.

MARKETING MEDIA REORGANIZATION
This project is not a priority for the company.
(i) It requires a lot of effort for the team, and there are other projects that need more attentions (mentioned above).  
(ii) We have to remember that the objective is to reduce the marketing that we do using old media, and explore all the possibilities of the Internet media. 
(iii) The project is frozen for time being. 

Please, if any of you have any comments about the projects, or just want to ask something about them, we can book a meeting whenever you can.

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Language students often encounter a variety of issues and challenges that can delay their learning process. One significant challenge is the complexity of grammar rules and sentence structure which may vary a lot from the mother tongue. Additionally, students may struggle with pronunciation and intonation, making effective verbal communication difficult.

Another common issue is the fear of making mistakes when talking in public, which can create anxiety in speaking and listening activities. This fear often leads to a lack of confidence and reluctance to participate in conversations impacting the learning experience.

Cultural differences can play a role as well, affecting how students interpret language and communication styles. Lastly, finding opportunities for real-life practice outside the classroom can be challenging, leaving students feeling isolated and underprepared in their language acquisition journey. These obstacles require dedication and support to overcome and it can vary between students.

Set your goals, practice regularly and don't be afraid of making mistakes.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. Response: Buying a home in my country, which is Spain, can be both exciting and challenging, especially when applying for a home loan. The process itself can be relatively straightforward, but it involves a lot of paperwork and attention to detail. First, one must choose the property, and then apply for a mortgage, which often requires submitting proof of income, tax returns, and details of your financial situation. Also, in Spain it is mandatory to sign the purchase before Notary Public, who can be helpful when it comes to understand all this paperwork.

The forms involved in the process can be numerous, depending on the bank or financial institution. Most banks require a full set of documents, including identification, proof of employment, and details of any other loans. The amount of paperwork might seem overwhelming, but with a good understanding of the requirements, it is manageable. 

In terms of cost, housing in Spain can be quite expensive, especially in larger cities like Madrid or Barcelona, where prices have been rising in recent years. Mortgage rates in Spain are generally low, but they can vary depending on the bank and the applicant's financial situation.

Regarding the use of professionals, it is common to employ a real estate agent to help with the property search.

"Prompt Level: 15.0 Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. Response: Learning a new language is an exciting yet often difficult journey. Many students face challenges that can slow their progress or make them feel discouraged. One common issue is the fear of making mistakes, which can prevent learners from speaking or participating actively in class. This fear is often rooted in a desire to be perfect rather than focusing on communication.

Another major challenge is maintaining motivation. At first, learning a new language can feel fresh and rewarding. However, over time, students may feel stuck or frustrated when progress becomes less noticeable. To stay motivated, it helps to set small, realistic goals and celebrate each achievement.

Time management is also a critical challenge. Language learning requires consistent practice, but many students struggle to balance it with other responsibilities. Creating a study routine and integrating language into daily life—such as watching foreign-language shows or journaling—can help.

Lastly, exposure to real-life language use is limited in classroom settings. Without regular opportunities to practice with native speakers, students may struggle with listening and speaking skills. Seeking language exchange partners or online communities can make a significant difference.

In conclusion, while language learning is challenging, identifying these obstacles and addressing them with practical strategies can lead to steady progress and greater confidence.

After dipping to a low of 20,956, the HSI surged to a high of 27,499.

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a paragraph describing how robots are being used in your country. How do you feel about them? In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: In India, robots are becoming increasingly integrated into various industries, revolutionizing sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, and even hospitality. Automation in factories helps streamline production, enhancing efficiency and reducing human error. In healthcare, robotic-assisted surgeries allow for greater precision, while AI-powered diagnostic systems support doctors in making accurate assessments. Even restaurants and hotels are adopting service robots to improve customer experience. While I don’t have personal feelings, I find their impact fascinating. Robots bring tremendous benefits—they increase productivity, reduce risks in hazardous environments, and enhance innovation. However, they also pose challenges, such as potential job displacement and ethical concerns regarding autonomy. As they become more advanced, society will need to ensure a balance between human labor and automation, fostering policies that support workers while embracing technological growth. With proper implementation, robots can complement human skills rather than replace them, creating a more efficient and harmonious future. What do you think—are robots a step toward a better tomorrow, or do they raise concerns you feel shouldn’t be ignored?

"Prompt Level: 16.0 Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: A legendary creature, also called a mythical creature, is a type of extraordinary or supernatural entity that is described in folklore (including myths and legends) and may be featured in historical accounts before modernity, but has not been scientifically proven.

In the classical era, monstrous creatures such as the Cyclops and the Minotaur appear in heroic tales for the protagonist to destroy. Other creatures, such as the unicorn, were claimed in accounts of natural history by various scholars of antiquity.[1][2][3] Some legendary creatures are hybrid beasts.

Some legendary creatures originated in traditional mythology and were believed to be real creatures--for example, dragons, griffins and unicorns. Others are based on real encounters or garbled accounts of travellers' tales, such as the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary, a sheeplike animal which supposedly grew tethered to the earth.[4]

Some animals, such as the gorilla, the kangaroo, the okapi, the Komodo dragon, the giant squid, and the platypus, were thought to be mythical before they were discovered by science.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: An airplane is a complex machine composed of several essential components, each playing a crucial role in ensuring its functionality and ability to fly. At the core is the fuselage, the main body of the aircraft, which houses the cockpit, passenger cabin, and cargo space. The cockpit contains the controls and navigation systems, enabling pilots to operate the airplane. The fuselage's structure is designed to withstand pressure differences during flight, ensuring passenger safety and comfort.
The wings are perhaps the most critical elements for flight. Their aerodynamic shape creates lift by generating lower pressure on the upper surface and higher pressure underneath. Flaps and ailerons on the wings further enhance control during takeoff, landing, and turns.
The tail assembly, also known as the empennage, provides stability. It includes the vertical stabilizer, which prevents side-to-side motion, and the horizontal stabilizer, which manages pitch control.
Finally, engines, whether jet or propeller-based, generate the thrust necessary for forward motion. Together, these parts harmonize to enable safe and efficient air travel.

Also, the use of chatGPT is very common nowadays, since it can be use at work and also for any domestic task such as cooking. I even had a friend who uses chatGPT to ask for any red flags on the guy she was dating. Crazy! 

I think technology is necessary and important in the world we live in. Specially for gen X and the future generations. It can help us be more productive and it's very useful in fields like medicine.

I’m really sorry to hear you’re going through such a tough time. It’s completely understandable to feel stressed with everything that’s happening. Regarding work, it might help to focus on what you can control. Try setting small, personal goals that give you a sense of achievement, even if management isn’t acknowledging your efforts. If things don’t improve, consider having a candid conversation with your manager about how their feedback (or lack thereof) affects the team. It might also be worthwhile to explore other job opportunities if the environment doesn’t improve.

As for your situation with Tia, it’s tough when relationships don’t go as planned. Have an open conversation with her about how you’re feeling. Sometimes, communication can clear misunderstandings and help both parties understand each other better. Regardless of the outcome, remember that it’s okay to feel down, and give yourself time to process your emotions.

Lean on your support network as much as you can, and consider talking to a counselor for some professional perspective. You’re not alone in this, and I’m always here to listen.

Take care,

Hi,

What a crazy week it's been for me. As you know, my work has been one of my major stressors, especially with the new management. They don't seem to understand how to motivate their staff, and when we do a good job, they don't acknowledge us. I'm not sure how much longer I can work here.

Also, do you remember Tia, the girl I met in the coffee shop a few months ago? Well, things aren't going well between us, and I think we might end the relationship. That's got me feeling really down because I thought it was going well for a while.

Sorry for bothering you with this – I've got no one else to talk about this, and I just needed to vent. You always seem to be so calm and in control; maybe you have some advice for me on how I can deal with these problems?

<code a=""NOUN"" c=""Dear ""></code>Leon<code a=""PHRA"" c="",

It's completely okay to reach out when you're feeling overwhelmed. Regarding your work stress, it might be helpful to consider documenting instances where you did an exceptional job but didn’t receive acknowledgment. This could provide a basis for discussing with HR or finding a new role if the situation doesn’t improve.

As for your relationship with Tia, it’s important to recognize that not all relationships will go as planned. Reflect on what you’ve learned from this experience and focus on what you can control. Sometimes ending a relationship is the best step for your emotional well-being.

You're strong, and these challenges will help you grow. If you need to talk more or need any specific advice, I'm here for you.

My friend, May, is a creature of habit. Every Tuesday, she works from her favorite corner table at ""The Daily Coffee,"" a cozy coffee shop downtown. One Tuesday, however, her routine was delightfully disrupted.

She was deeply engrossed in her work when she noticed a man struggling with a stack of books at the counter. He was clearly flustered, and a few books had already tumbled to the floor. Without thinking, May rose and helped him gather the scattered volumes.

The man, whose name was Lucas, thanked her profusely and, as a gesture of gratitude, offered to buy her a coffee. They struck up a conversation, discovering a shared love for classic literature and indie music. Time flew by, and May found herself genuinely enjoying their impromptu meeting.

They exchanged numbers, and over the next few weeks, they met again at The Daily Grind, their conversations flowing as easily as the coffee. Maya, who usually kept to herself, found herself looking forward to Tuesdays.

It wasn't a grand, dramatic event, but a simple, unexpected connection forged over spilled books and shared interests. Sometimes, the most ordinary days can lead to the most extraordinary moments. May's Tuesday routine was forever changed, proving that even in the midst of a busy city, a little kindness and a shared love for coffee can lead to something special.

It gives me great pleasure to announce that our CEO has decided to change the Company's logo.  Our market research survey shows while people like our product, they thought our former logo was old fashion.
Therefore, we have decided on a modern design to keep these customers.  Consequently, a more modern logo could improve our reputation as a leader in the field.

I hope you're both doing well. After reviewing the two proposals, I’d like to suggest a third option that I believe could be a great fit for our city's needs and long-term goals.

In addition to the current plans, I propose that we focus on revitalizing the River District, which has seen an increase in interest from both residents and businesses. The area offers unique opportunities for green space, cultural events, and riverfront developments. With the recent growth in tech companies and startups in our city, there is a rising demand for flexible workspaces that encourage collaboration and creativity.

We could invest in transforming the River District into a vibrant mixed-use development with office spaces, recreational areas, and cultural hubs that reflect the city's commitment to innovation and sustainability. This approach would not only attract investment but also support the local economy and provide an exciting new destination for both locals and tourists.

Let me know what you think about this idea.

Opening:

We are delighted to announce the renewal of our partnership with Crum. This achievement underscores our team’s dedication and hard work. As an added bonus, our commitment to quality has been recognized and praised by our partners.

Body:

Three months ago, we faced a significant challenge with unresolved defects in our products. These issues were causing disruptions and dissatisfaction among our customers. Additionally, we encountered several minor technical problems that further complicated the situation.

To address these challenges, we implemented two key solutions:

Changed Update Delivery: We revised our update delivery process to ensure more timely and efficient rollouts. This change has helped us minimize disruptions and provide a smoother experience for our customers.
Improved Quality Assurance Processes: We enhanced our Quality Assurance (QA) processes to identify and resolve defects more effectively. This improvement has significantly reduced the number of issues and increased the overall reliability of our products.
These solutions were only possible because of the excellent cross-team collaboration within our organization. By working together, we were able to overcome these challenges and improve our service quality.

Closing:

Looking ahead, we are committed to providing further support to avoid any future problems with our customers. Our focus will remain on continuous improvement and maintaining the high standards that have earned us the trust and praise of our partners. By prioritizing quality and customer satisfaction, we aim to strengthen our partnerships and achieve even greater success in the future.

Here are some ideas for motivating your employees. I also included some things to avoid.

Incentivize your employees. Make them feel that the company's success means success for them as well. There's nothing like a possible reward to motivate people.
Take an active interest in your employees' career paths. Offer them additional training and act as their mentor.
Emphasize a healthy work-life balance. Recognize that employees have lives outside the company.
Listen to your employees. If people feel like they are being heard, even when they are complaining, they will be happier and more productive.
Treat subordinates the way you would like to be treated by your superiors.
Here are five ways to demotivate your staff:

Disrespect subordinates because they are below you.
Take credit or claim responsibility for work done by your subordinates.
Lose your temper.
Let employees unfairly take the blame for things.
Don't compliment or praise people for good work.

Thanks for summarizing our discussions. I understand the urgency of making a decision. I have been thinking about another option that might balance both our needs and concerns.

What if we consider relocating to the newly developed business district in Northville? This area has been growing rapidly and offers several advantages:

Lower Rent Costs: The rent in Northville is significantly lower than in Centerville, which would help us save on expenses. For example, commercial spaces are currently available for around $3,000 per month, which is a substantial saving compared to the $4,500 we would be paying in Centerville.

Growing Customer Base: Northville is attracting a lot of new businesses and residents, which means we could tap into a fresh customer base. The area is becoming known for its trendy boutiques and cafes, making it an attractive destination for shoppers.

Maintaining Personalized Service: We could set up a smaller showroom in Northville to maintain the personalized service our customers value. This way, we can still offer a space for customers to see and feel the fabrics, while also leveraging the lower rent costs.

Enhanced Online Presence: Alongside the showroom, we can invest in improving our website to offer virtual consultations and detailed product views. This hybrid approach would allow us to maintain our high level of customer service while adapting to modern shopping trends.

I believe this option could provide a balanced solution, combining cost savings with the ability to maintain our personalized service and tap into a new market.

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: You need to address the concerns of your company's shareholders. Write an email to reassure them. Read your notes first. Type in the input box. Write 150–250 words. Response: Dear Shareholders,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m writing to address some concerns that have been raised regarding the stability of the construction business and rumors surrounding our share prices.

First and foremost, I want to stress that Future Foundations is in a solid position to maintain stability in an otherwise unpredictable market. The rumors you may have heard about a significant drop in share prices are unfounded. While it's true that two months ago our share value dipped, this was a direct consequence of the former CEO, Greg Johnson, stepping down. However, with Harry Levi—an industry leader with an excellent reputation—now at the helm, we have seen our share value not only recover but increase to an all-time high.

We understand how important stability is to you as shareholders, and I’m pleased to inform you that we have recently secured three major contracts, ensuring profitability over the next three years. These contracts are a testament to the strength of our leadership and the quality of our operations. We are confident that they will drive continued growth and further solidify our market position.

Your loyalty has been crucial to our success, and we greatly appreciate your continued trust in Future Foundations. We believe the future is bright, and we are committed to keeping you informed every step of the way. To further reassure you of our long-term strategy, we will soon be sharing our five-year road map, which outlines our goals and vision for continued growth and stability.

Thank you for your support, and please don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions.

"Prompt Level: 13.0 Prompt: Use the information in the notes to write an informative text about NAFTA, or write about a trade agreement your country is a part of. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Response: NAFTA: A Detailed Look at North American Trade
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a groundbreaking accord between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, officially coming into force in January 1994. The culmination of years of intricate negotiations, NAFTA's primary goal was to dramatically reduce or completely eliminate customs duties among its three member states. This initiative aimed to foster a more integrated and fluid economic environment across North America.
NAFTA's impact was far-reaching, profoundly reshaping trade relations, particularly within the agricultural sector. A notable example of this transformation was the significant increase in the flow of Mexican fruits and vegetables into the US market. Beyond agriculture, the agreement influenced various industries by removing trade barriers, which theoretically made goods and services cheaper and more accessible across borders.
While NAFTA generated both positive and negative impacts for each of the participating countries, the general consensus among economists and policymakers is that, overall, it benefited all three members. It spurred economic growth, increased trade volumes, and led to greater specialization in production among the nations. However, it also faced criticism, particularly concerning job displacement in certain sectors and environmental concerns. Despite these debates, NAFTA served as the cornerstone of North American trade policy for over two decades until it was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2020, marking a new chapter in regional economic cooperation.
Would you like to know more about the specific impacts of NAFTA on any of the member countries, or perhaps about the USMCA that replaced it?

"Prompt Level: 7.0 Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. Response: An airplane is made up of several key parts, each serving a specific function to enable flight. The **fuselage** is the main body of the aircraft, housing the cockpit, passengers, and cargo. It provides structural support and connects all other components.

The **wings** are essential for generating lift. As air flows over and under the wings, their shape creates an upward force that allows the plane to rise and stay aloft. Wings may also contain fuel tanks and support devices like flaps and ailerons, which help control the aircraft's direction and stability.

The **tail**, or empennage, consists of the horizontal stabilizer and vertical fin. These structures help maintain balance and control. The horizontal stabilizer ensures pitch stability (up and down movement), while the vertical fin helps the plane maintain a straight course by stabilizing yaw (side-to-side movement).

Lastly, the **engines** provide the thrust needed for the airplane to move forward. Modern airplanes typically use jet engines or turboprops, which propel the aircraft and enable the wings to generate lift.

Together, these parts work in harmony to make flight possible. Correction: <input>An airplane is made up of several key parts, each serving a specific function to enable flight.

Our crews — from IT squads to marketing units — have proven their resilience. You've tightened the sails, adjusted the course, and kept us afloat even in turbulent times.

As captain of this journey, I don’t take credit alone. It’s your commitment, your insight, your teamwork that has made the difference.

Here are some ideas for motivating your employees, along with things to avoid:

Ways to Motivate Your Employees:
Incentivize Your Employees: Make them feel that the company’s success means success for them as well. There’s nothing like a possible reward to motivate people.
Take an Active Interest in Their Career Paths: Offer additional training and act as their mentor.
Emphasize a Healthy Work-Life Balance: Recognize that employees have lives outside the company.
Listen to Your Employees: If people feel like they are being heard, even when they are complaining, they will be happier and more productive.

Ways to Demotivate Your Staff:
Disrespect Subordinates: Treating them poorly because they are below you.
Take Credit for Their Work: Claiming responsibility for work done by your subordinates.
Lose Your Temper: Showing anger and frustration.

Feedback:
The content is clear and well-organized, making it easy to follow.
Repeating the same message multiple times is unnecessary and can be confusing. Stick to one version of the message.
Consider adding specific examples or anecdotes to make the advice more relatable and actionable.

Dear colleague,

This is to inform you of an upcoming change in company policy. Starting on the first Monday of next month, the company will be providing free breakfasts to all employees. We hope this will be a way to lessen the stress of trying to grab something to eat before getting to work, and also give us all a chance to socialize a bit before we start our day.

We're very pleased with our menu. We will be offering fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, bagels and doughnuts every day. In addition, we will have one hot item each day. This could be anything from scrambled eggs and potatoes to pancakes with maple syrup. We will also be offering fresh-brewed coffees and teas, along with fresh-squeezed orange and grapefruit juices.

I'd like everyone to be as excited as I am, and I'm hoping that, with your help and creativity, this new policy will be a big success.

Thanks for your help.

Hey Rahul,

I have to tell you about the weirdest thing that happened to me yesterday. I was at the park, just minding my own business, enjoying an ice cream, when suddenly, a squirrel ran up to me, looked me straight in the eye, and snatched the cone right from my hand! I was too shocked to react. It didn’t even run away immediately—it just sat there on the bench, licking MY ice cream like it had just paid for it.

As if that wasn’t bizarre enough, a little kid nearby saw the whole thing and started laughing so hard he fell over. His mom came over and asked if I was okay, but honestly, I was more impressed than upset. Who knew squirrels were such bold little thieves?

Moral of the story: Never underestimate a hungry squirrel. Anyway, how have you been? Anything exciting on your end?

Talk soon!

after that the company grew, locations in 20 cities all over the world, more than 5,000 employees.
 
Let's change gears, if I can draw your attention to  the pie chart, our profit of 5 million dollars last year and 10 percent of the global market.
