Why do you think these differences exist?, So I think a lot of people of my age are really aware of the fact that we are successful for our own luck. We are really trying to achieve that. I think the older people are not aware of that and that is because actually our parents who are those older people grow up in a time where they become more aware of that not everybody's life is already set at the moment they are born. And that's the message we got to hear a lot when we were kids. And you notice that the millennials  of now are really aware of this and are really high achievers and that is some of the risks we have as we aim too much and therefore sometimes we need to be aware of that. On the other side we really do a lot of cool stuff in our life and that makes me as well happy.,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,75.0,77108_t1_q14
