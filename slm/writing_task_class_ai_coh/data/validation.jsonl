Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: A major trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico was created in 1994 and was known as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Its main objective was to promote economic cooperation among the three nations by removing trade restrictions like tariffs and quotas. The goal of NAFTA was to make the North American market more interconnected in order to boost trade and investment flows.\n\nThe decrease or removal of tariffs on the majority of commodities moved between the three nations was one of NAFTA's main results, which lowered product prices for consumers and expanded export prospects for companies. Furthermore, it promoted manufacturing operations to be moved, especially to Mexico, where labor costs were lower, which helped the country's economy.\nHowever, NAFTA also had its critics, particularly in the United States and Canada, where some feared job losses and wage stagnation. In 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which modernized provisions on digital trade, labor standards, and environmental protections, while maintaining many of the original goals of NAFTA.\n\nOverall, NAFTA played a crucial role in shaping the economic landscape of North America and fostering stronger trade relations among the three nations.\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

Make it interesting and descriptive, and remember to check for pronoun reference. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Writing descriptively is a powerful technique that brings scenes, characters, and emotions to life by appealing to the reader’s senses. It goes beyond simply stating facts; it paints vivid pictures through carefully chosen words and details. When writing descriptively, an author might describe not just how a place looks, but how it smells, sounds, feels, or even tastes. For example, instead of saying “The room was messy,” a descriptive writer might say, “Clothes were strewn across the floor, and the scent of old pizza lingered in the air.” This kind of writing allows readers to immerse themselves in the story, visualizing every element as if they were experiencing it themselves. Strong descriptive writing often uses figurative language such as metaphors and similes, as well as precise adjectives and verbs. It requires careful observation and attention to detail. Ultimately, writing descriptively makes narratives more engaging and memorable by helping readers connect emotionally and sensorially with the text.", "task_id": "52a760cd-9898-4cce-bb43-c490923b2b45", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: Health professionals can work in many different settings, including hospitals, nursing and residential care facilities, physicians' offices, home healthcare services, outpatient care centers and medical laboratories. Working conditions and salaries vary widely from profession to profession and from region to region. A nursing aid might earn as little as $12,000 a year while a surgeon can make over $250,000.\n\nA career in medicine has benefits as well as shortcomings. On the one hand, jobs are generally well-paid and demand is high for skilled, qualified people.

Most physicians, for example, work more than 60 hours a week and can be on-call at any time, day or night. Shift work is common in some occupations, such as for registered nurses.

Repair any structural issues, including cracks in walls or ceilings, and ensure that the roof is watertight. An inspection by a professional may also be helpful to identify hidden hazards.  \n   \n2. Fire Safety: Install smoke detectors and fire extinguishers in key areas, and ensure exits are clear and accessible. Check that the electrical wiring meets safety standards, as outdated systems can increase fire risks.  \n\n3. Security: Upgrade security measures, such as installing locks on all windows and doors, a burglar alarm, and possibly CCTV. Insurers often offer lower premiums for secure premises.  \n\n4. Liability Risks: Ensure floors are even and free of tripping hazards, and add appropriate signage for customer safety.  \n\nAddressing these points should help minimize risks and make your shop more attractive to insurers.

You're right: becoming a doctor is demanding, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.\n\nMedical training is intense. The pre-clinical years focus on science-heavy coursework, while clinical training involves long hours in hospitals, working directly with patients under supervision.

You can specialize in surgery, pediatrics, psychiatry, emergency medicine, or even work in public health or research. Each path offers different work environments and lifestyles.\n\nAs a resident (and even more so as a fellow), you do get paid—though it’s modest compared to the hours you work. It’s usually enough to cover basic living expenses, especially with careful budgeting, but it’s not lavish.\n\nWorking in a clinic or hospital is fast-paced and varied. You'll experience everything from deep fatigue to immense satisfaction, especially when you make a real difference in someone’s life.\n\nIf you’re passionate about helping people and willing to commit to lifelong learning, medicine can be an amazing journey.\n\nBest of luck,\nA Fellow Med Warrior", "task_id": "ae90d852-9ab7-47ca-a8f8-4a90eaec83f4", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

Thanks largely to television and the Internet, stories about the chupacabra and other modern mythic creatures spread quickly between communities, countries and even continents.

In some places, the chupacabra is a mysterious predator lurking in the forest; in others, it is a sensational, sometimes tongue-in-cheek, media creation. People tell of the chupacabra's glowing red eyes and glistening fangs, and of how the beast lurks in the forest, preying on goats and cattle, terrifying local residents. Chupacabra means \"goat sucker\" in Spanish, and according to reports, the creature acts much like a vampire, killing animals by sucking their blood. Though similar stories date back several decades, the first major wave of alleged chupacabra sightings came from farmers in Puerto Rico in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Teams often worked in silos, leading to misaligned priorities and missed deadlines. Possible solutions included implementing project management software, conducting regular inter-departmental meetings, and assigning a liaison to ensure smooth coordination. Ultimately, the company adopted project management software and scheduled weekly cross-team updates. This improved transparency and accountability, significantly reducing delays.

These armies have had small battles between themselves over disputed territories while resisting operations by the Federal forces based in Federal Territory.\n\nUntil a month ago the situation was a stalemate, however, the various factions have been rearming under the pretence of negotiations.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, metaphor and symbolism stand out as particularly useful. Metaphors allow writers to convey complex ideas and emotions through vivid comparisons, making abstract concepts more relatable and engaging for readers. For instance, describing a challenging situation as \"climbing a mountain\" can instantly evoke the struggle and perseverance involved. Symbolism, on the other hand, adds depth to writing by using objects, characters, or events to represent larger themes and ideas. This technique enriches the narrative, inviting readers to uncover deeper meanings and connections.\n\nFree writing and focused free writing are also valuable techniques. Free writing encourages the flow of ideas without the constraints of structure or grammar, which can help overcome writer's block and generate raw material for more polished pieces. Focused free writing narrows this approach to a specific topic, making it easier to develop targeted content.\n\nLoop writing and listing are practical for organizing thoughts and exploring different angles of a topic. Loop writing involves writing continuously on a subject, then looping back to refine and expand on key points. Listing helps in brainstorming and structuring ideas logically.\n\n", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The concept of celebrity itself warrants scrutiny. While fame may stem from genuine talent or accomplishment, the nature of modern celebrity often emphasizes superficial qualities over substance. Celebrities, at times, are placed on pedestals based solely on their curated online personas, rather than on meaningful contributions to society. This can create unrealistic ideals that influence public perception, especially among younger audiences, encouraging materialism and unattainable beauty standards.\nFurthermore, the media’s relentless focus on the private lives of celebrities perpetuates a culture that values voyeurism over genuine engagement. For example, the obsession with their relationships, controversies, or fashion choices often overshadows their artistic or professional endeavors. In this way, the celebrity phenomenon can detract from promoting individuals who achieve remarkable feats in science, education, or social activism.\nThat said, many celebrities use their platform to advocate for important causes, showing that fame can be leveraged for positive change. Yet, the fixation on stardom raises the question: Should society shift its focus from idolizing fame to celebrating the unsung heroes who truly make a difference? The answer may lie in recalibrating our values and finding inspiration in those who influence the world behind the spotlight.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: \nStrategic Summary\nZen is poised to enter the niche hotel market as a boutique hotel, spa, and health and fitness center, requiring an initial investment of $4 million. Market research from AccomData Group indicates a growing trend toward weekend getaways at relaxing resorts, alongside an increasing focus on healthy lifestyles. Current surveys reveal dissatisfaction with cuisine options at most fitness centers, presenting a unique opportunity. Zen will feature a healthy menu crafted by top chefs from renowned restaurants, fully equipped gyms, and swimming pools with trained instructors. We anticipate a construction timeline of approximately two years, with a return on investment expected in the second year following our opening. Projections indicate an annual profit of $1 million after the second year, with total investment recouped within four years.\n\nRisk Assessment\nOur financial projections account for potential economic downturns, ensuring conservative estimates. If the economy remains stable, the time required for recouping investment and generating profits could be halved. To further mitigate risks, we have partnered with Kudos Advertising Agency for an intensive media campaign aimed at maximizing visibility and attracting guests to Zen. This strategic approach positions us well to thrive in a competitive market.\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "0efc8863-e086-4c4a-aa14-7f688dec4cb3", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 5}

Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home in India can be both exciting and challenging. The process involves several steps, including choosing a property, securing a home loan, and completing legal formalities. Housing prices vary significantly based on location, with metro cities like Mumbai and Delhi being quite expensive compared to smaller towns.  \n\nApplying for a home loan in India requires substantial paperwork. Banks and financial institutions typically ask for proof of identity, income, employment details, property documents, and credit history. The process can take a few weeks, depending on the lender and the applicant’s financial profile. Interest rates generally range between 8% and 9.5%, influenced by the applicant’s credit score, loan tenure, and the bank’s policies.  \n\nWhile it’s not mandatory to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker, many buyers prefer working with them to navigate the complex legal and financial aspects of home buying. Agents help find suitable properties, negotiate prices, and handle paperwork, while mortgage brokers assist in comparing loan options.  \n\nOverall, purchasing a home in India requires careful planning, financial discipline, and patience. With rising property prices and high loan requirements, affordability can be a concern for many first-time buyers. However, government schemes like PMAY (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana) offer subsidies, making homeownership more accessible for eligible individuals.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Upon death, instead of ascending to higher realms, he was cursed to become a Brahmarakshasa a being of immense power, bound by sorrow and rage.\n\nIn his monstrous form, he roams ancient forests and temple ruins, his eyes burning with the pain of lost honor. He remembers his past life vividly his students, his family, the respect he once commanded. This memory torments him. At times, he weeps under moonlit skies, his cries echoing through the trees like a forgotten hymn.\n\nYet, hope flickers. Legends say that if someone performs sincere penance or recites sacred mantras with compassion, the Brahmarakshasa may be freed redeemed through the very knowledge he once misused. His tale is a haunting reminder: even the wisest can fall, but redemption is never beyond reach.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words.

It holds the passengers, cargo, and cockpit where the pilots sit and control the aircraft. It connects all the other parts together.\n\nThe wings are essential for flight. They create lift when air moves over and under them, which helps the airplane rise into the sky and stay in the air. Most airplanes also have flaps and ailerons on the wings, which help control the direction and stability during flight.\n\nThe tail, or empennage, includes the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. It keeps the airplane balanced and helps control pitch (up and down movement) and yaw (side to side movement).\n\nFinally, the engines provide the thrust needed to move the airplane forward. They are usually located under the wings or on the back of the fuselage. Without engines, the plane wouldn’t be able to take off or maintain speed.\n\nEach of these parts works together to allow the airplane to take off, fly, and land safely.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Free writing and loop writing are two techniques that have proven to be incredibly useful for me. Free writing involves writing continuously without worrying about grammar, punctuation, or even coherence. This technique allows me to express my thoughts freely and unlock my creativity, helping me overcome writer's block and discover new ideas. On the other hand, loop writing is a structured approach where I write about a topic, then review and expand on specific points, looping back to refine and deepen my understanding. This method helps me organize my thoughts and develop a more comprehensive and polished piece of writing. By combining these techniques, I can start with free writing to generate raw content and ideas, and then use loop writing to refine and structure my work. This combination not only enhances my productivity but also improves the quality of my writing, making it more coherent and impactful. Overall, free writing and loop writing complement each other perfectly, providing a balanced approach to both creativity and organization in my writing process.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

The mild climate makes it a more pleasant place to live for those who enjoy warmth and sunshine year-round. However, when it comes to job opportunities, Cagliari falls short compared to Milan.

In manufacturing, robots handle repetitive tasks with precision, reducing human error and increasing output.

Additionally, robots are being used in agriculture for tasks like planting and harvesting, which helps address labor shortages2. I believe robots have the potential to greatly benefit society by taking over dangerous or monotonous tasks, allowing humans to focus on more creative and complex work.

The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.", "task_id": "bb0d114c-9550-4f27-9138-b2eb14c39437", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

Then you must tidy the yard since it could represent a heath risk due the presence of animals and other stuff.\nThe roof leakage needs to be repaired and you have to make the sidewalk free from any obstacles.\nMoving on the interior, you should install the air conditioning and the lighting system must be replaced. You also need to remove the stacked boxes and buy a new fire extinguisher. Last but not least all those chemicals must either be disposed of or put inside a proper place.\n\nThat's all.\n\nRegards.", "task_id": "9e54df01-235a-418f-9836-724a7d2eda5e", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 3}

He was sitting in his usual spot at the local café, nursing his coffee and people-watching, when a man in a tweed jacket and antique-looking boots slid into the seat across from him.\n\nWithout any preamble, the man leaned forward and said, “2024 is a fascinating year for innovation, don’t you think?” Nate, assuming he was some eccentric professor, nodded politely. But the guy didn’t stop there. He started rambling about future technology, mentioning gadgets that haven’t been invented yet and referencing events that haven’t happened.\n\nAt first, Nate thought it was just a weird coincidence or maybe a prank, but then the guy pulled out a pocket watch. Not just any pocket watch, though—it had moving parts that seemed to defy physics, almost floating.\n\nBefore Nate could ask anything, the man stood, tipped his hat, and said, “Good luck in 2031. You’re going to love Mars.” Then he vanished into the crowd.\n\nWas he a time traveler? A lunatic?

Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in my country can be a complex and time-consuming process, though it varies depending on the buyer’s circumstances. The process generally starts with getting pre-approved for a loan, which involves submitting a variety of financial documents such as proof of income, credit history, and existing debts. Once that’s done, the search for a home begins, often with the help of a real estate agent, though some buyers may choose to go it alone.\n\nWhen it comes to the home loan application itself, there are indeed many forms to fill out. These forms cover everything from personal details to financial information and the specifics of the property. It can feel like a mountain of paperwork, and mistakes or missed details can delay the process. Housing prices in my country are quite high, especially in urban areas, making it challenging for first-time buyers to afford a property. As for interest rates, they can fluctuate, but currently, they tend to hover around the mid-range depending on the loan type and the buyer's creditworthiness.\n\nMost people do choose to work with a mortgage broker to navigate the loan process since they can help find the best rates and terms. While not absolutely necessary, having a broker can make the experience less stressful and increase the chances of securing a favorable deal.

Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Media has transformed significantly in my lifetime. Earlier, traditional media like newspapers, magazines, television, and radio were the main sources of information and entertainment. These forms of media required waiting for the morning paper or tuning into scheduled broadcasts to stay informed. However, with the rise of the internet, everything changed.

Instead of scheduled broadcasts, information is available 24/7, according to individual preferences.\n\nCurrently, I rely heavily on the digital media, particularly online news portals, podcasts, and e-books. This shift has reduced my reading habits.  In the future, artificial intelligence likely rules the digital platform.

The incident occurred at night, and although Medina claimed to believe the house was empty and entered only in fear, the court found this justification insufficient. The plaintiff’s family experienced emotional distress and a sense of being terrorized as their home was ransacked. Although there was no clear evidence of theft or mention of specific valuables taken, the act of forced entry and the damage caused were enough to warrant a criminal offense.\n\nThe court imposed a fine of $1,000 to be paid in two installments—one immediately—and assigned 300 hours of community service. The verdict appears appropriate, balancing the severity of the intrusion with the lack of malicious intent. Medina’s actions had serious emotional consequences for the family, and the punishment reflects both accountability and an opportunity for rehabilitation.", "task_id": "bb0d114c-9550-4f27-9138-b2eb14c39437", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

Three types of small business insurance are recommended, including one that is mandatory. While business property and liability insurance is important, the company is not legally obligated to have any, whereas employers must provide workers compensation insurance to cover injuries and illnesses that are job-related.\n\nSmall business property insurance\nProperty insurance can be categorized by what is insured and by the events leading to a loss. Among the items to consider insuring are buildings and other structures, furniture, equipment, and supplies, leased equipment, inventory, money and securities, records of accounts receivable, machinery, computers, as well as intangible property such as goodwill and trademarks.\n\nNamed-peril policies will cover certain losses resulting only from those perils that the policy names; all-risk policies offer coverage for all perils except those specifically named in the policy. An all-risk policy is usually sufficient for the average small business, but all businesses, and thus their insurance needs, are different. Deductibles for property insurance can be calculated on a per-claim or on an aggregate basis.\n\nLiability insurance\nLiability insurance will protect business assets in the event the company is sued. Lawsuits are so common these days that no firm can do without the proper amount of liability insurance. Liability insurance will not only pay the cost of the damages but also the legal fees and other associated costs, which can be substantial. However, liability insurance will not protect against claims arising from nonperformance of a contract, wrongful termination of employees, sexual harassment, or race and gender lawsuits. Usually a surety bond is taken out as performance insurance. Employment practices liability insurance (EPLI) protects the business against employment-related claims, such as sexual harassment.", "task_id": "9e54df01-235a-418f-9836-724a7d2eda5e", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 1}

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language students often encounter a variety of challenges in their learning journey, which can affect their progress and motivation. One major issue is the complexity of grammar rules, which can be particularly daunting for beginners. Many languages have intricate grammatical structures that differ significantly from a student's native language, leading to confusion and errors.\n\nAnother challenge is vocabulary acquisition. Students must memorize and effectively use a large number of new words and phrases, which can be overwhelming. This is compounded by the presence of idiomatic expressions and slang, which often do not translate directly and require cultural understanding.\n\nPronunciation and listening comprehension also pose significant hurdles. Students may struggle with sounds that do not exist in their native language, making it difficult to speak clearly and understand native speakers. Speed and accents in spoken language can further complicate listening comprehension.\n\nCultural differences are another area of difficulty. Language is deeply intertwined with culture, and students must learn the cultural contexts and nuances that influence communication styles, idioms, and expressions.\n\nLastly, maintaining motivation and confidence can be challenging, especially when progress seems slow. The fear of making mistakes often hinders students from practicing speaking and participating in conversations, which are crucial for language acquisition.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a combination of effective teaching methods, immersive experiences, and encouragement to foster a supportive learning environment.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: In this report you’ll find a summary of the research between the two selected training companies to collaborate with.\nIt has been a long time since we have started this research which has quite involved you, so you probably already know that the two competitors are TrainQuick and Skills Pro.\n\nAlthough TrainQuick stays the more affordable solution with its cost-effectiveness and its flexibility, most of the registered employees from the other branch didn’t seem to use it. It should be the only major TrainQuick’s drawback as it remains in its choice to mix all the company’s employees in their classes, instead of maintaining affinity groups of colleagues, which would have been much better for employee integration and confidence.\nTherefore, the fact that the course offered is not being used means that another option should be considered.\n\nOn the other hand there is Skills Pro. It is a totally other way of approaching training. Its course is more expensive but people who have taken it often finish the course successfully. Another plus for Skills Pro is that despite the attendants majority have described it difficult, they plan to expand their courses in order to pursue their improving skills.\n\nIn short, we would probably go with Skills Pro at the end of our company subscription with TrainQuick. The management should decide on a budget review since Skills Pro is more costly.

And so, in 2001, Frisko Shipping was born.\n\nToday, we have locations in 20 cities worldwide, with more than 5,000 dedicated employees. Last year, we earned a profit of 5 million dollars, securing 10 percent of the global market. Quite the journey from that single moment of inspiration!\n\nNow, as new members of our team, we expect you to bring motivation, enthusiasm, and fresh ideas. To make this fun, we’ll start with a little quiz to see how much you already know about Frisko Shipping.\n\nAs you move forward, remember Bill’s story. Inspiration can strike anywhere. So, I challenge you all to find your own moments of inspiration here and make a meaningful impact. Let’s build the future of Frisko Shipping together!\n\nThank you!", "task_id": "5c89b5ef-f9e4-44c0-bd77-31ed1d856ff0", "ef_level": 11.0, "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has a profound positive impact on both businesses and society. By integrating social and environmental concerns into their operations, companies can contribute to sustainable development while enhancing their own reputation and profitability.\nOne of the most significant benefits of CSR is its ability to foster a positive public image. Companies that actively engage in CSR initiatives, such as reducing carbon footprints, supporting local communities, or ensuring fair labor practices, are often viewed more favorably by consumers. This positive perception can lead to increased customer loyalty and trust, which are crucial for long-term business success.\nMoreover, CSR initiatives can attract and retain employees. Many individuals today seek to work for companies that align with their personal values and demonstrate a commitment to social and environmental responsibility. By promoting a culture of ethical behavior and community involvement, businesses can enhance employee satisfaction and reduce turnover rates.\nCSR also encourages innovation. When companies strive to address social and environmental challenges, they often develop new products, services, or processes that can lead to competitive advantages. \nFurthermore, CSR can lead to stronger relationships with stakeholders, including investors, suppliers, and regulators. Demonstrating a commitment to ethical practices and sustainability can enhance a company's credibility and lead to more favorable business conditions.\nIn summary, CSR has a multifaceted positive impact, benefiting not only society and the environment but also the businesses themselves.

[SEP] Response: \nIn a tort action case involving trespassing, the plaintiff, the Byron family, accused Mr. Medina of breaking into their home, leaving them distressed and terrorised. Although the plaintiff mentioned that Medina took valuables, specific items were not identified. On the defence side, Mr. Medina claimed he believed the house was empty and sought shelter during the night out of fear. However, he admitted to ransacking the house.\n\nThe judge ruled that trespassing constitutes a criminal offence, holding Medina liable for his actions. As a result, the verdict was in favour of the Byrons. Mr. Medina was fined $1,000, to be paid in two instalments, with one payment due immediately. Additionally, he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. This case underscores the serious legal implications of trespassing, highlighting the balance between personal accountability and understanding the circumstances that led to the offence. \nThis ruling serves as a reminder of the importance of respecting private property and the potential consequences of failing to do so. It also highlights the court's consideration of both the impact on the victims and the circumstances surrounding the defendant's actions.

Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home in India is a major life decision and involves a lengthy and sometimes complex process. First, one must decide on the location and budget. Housing prices vary significantly across the country. In metro cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore, real estate is extremely expensive, while smaller cities and towns offer more affordable options.\n\nApplying for a home loan requires various documents, including proof of identity, Income, address, and property details. Banks and housing finance companies often request salary slips, bank statements, PAN cards, and employment proof. Though the process has become more streamlined with digital platforms, it can still be time-consuming due to verifications and paperwork.\n\nInterest rates in India vary depending on the bank and the applicant's credit profile. As of now, the average home loan interest rate ranges between 8% and 10%. Many people use areal estate agent or broker to find suitable properties and handle negotiations, although it's not mandatory. For loans, some also use mortgage advisors who help compare offers from various lenders.\n\nOverall, while the process is manageable with the right guidance, it can feel overwhelming for first-time buyers. However, government schemes like PMAY(Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana) provides subsidies that help make housing more affordable for middle-and lower-income families.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In my country, robots are increasingly being used in industries such as manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, and customer service. In factories, they help speed up production by performing repetitive tasks with precision. In hospitals, robots assist doctors with surgeries and help deliver medicine to patients. Even in restaurants and supermarkets, service robots are becoming more common, helping customers and improving efficiency. I feel both excited and concerned about this change. On one hand, robots can improve our lives by making work safer, reducing human error, and increasing productivity. They can also take over dangerous or boring jobs, allowing humans to focus on more creative and meaningful work. However, I worry about the impact on employment. As robots take over certain roles, many people may lose their jobs and struggle to find new ones, especially if they lack the skills needed in a more tech-driven society. There is also the risk of becoming too dependent on machines. In conclusion, robots offer great benefits to society, but we must find a balance to make sure everyone can adapt and thrive in this changing world.", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learners frequently encounter a range of issues and challenges on their journey to fluency. One common obstacle is the complexity of grammar rules, which can be inconsistent and difficult to master. Vocabulary acquisition is another hurdle, as students must memorize and correctly use a large number of words and phrases. Pronunciation and accents can also pose significant challenges, as subtle differences in sounds can alter meanings.\n\nCultural differences and idiomatic expressions can create confusion and misunderstandings, while the fear of making mistakes often leads to a lack of confidence in speaking. Limited opportunities for real-life practice and immersion further hinder progress. Additionally, balancing language studies with other responsibilities can be demanding, and finding effective learning resources and methods is essential for success. Despite these challenges, persistence and dedication can ultimately lead to language proficiency and cultural understanding.

Isso vai impactar ainda mais os nossos lucros — estamos falando de R$ 54.000 por ano!\n\nVou recapitular o que discutimos até agora. Sei que você é bastante favorável a permanecermos no local atual, mesmo com o aumento do aluguel. A principal vantagem disso é que estamos numa área badalada, onde temos uma clientela fiel. Além disso, estamos no centro, o que facilita para quem quer ser atendido no intervalo do trabalho, seja para tirar medidas ou escolher uma peça exclusiva.\n\nPor outro lado, nossas vendas de roupas estão crescendo em um ritmo mais lento do que as despesas, e, com o crescimento acelerado de Centerville, é provável que o aluguel continue subindo.\n\nVocê já conhece minha posição: sou a favor de mudarmos para outro modelo. Podemos transferir a produção para a zona sul da cidade e passar a atender os clientes nos próprios locais de trabalho ou estudo. Além disso, poderíamos investir em um site mais moderno, onde os clientes escolhem as roupas e inserem suas medidas. Isso reduziria consideravelmente os custos. O ponto negativo seria a perda do nosso espaço físico, onde as pessoas podem ver os tecidos, conversar conosco e receber um atendimento mais personalizado — algo que sempre foi nosso diferencial.\n\nPara ser sincera, gostaria de encontrar uma terceira alternativa, mas no momento estou sem ideias.

Your boss has asked you to summarize an article for him so that he can better talk in English about the major players in the industry. Summarize the article. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: \nPharmacy today\nKey industry players\nMost of the pharmaceutical industry is concentrated in developed regions – the U.S., Europe and Japan. The market is characterized by complex national regulations and consolidation among the largest international groups.  An important reason for these mergers is the need for economies of scale, as well as the increasing amount of money dedicated to research and development (R&D).\n\nGlaxoSmithKline\nGlaxoSmithKline is a leading company focusing on research. The company was formed in 2000 through the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. Their headquarters are in the U.K., and their operations are based in the U.S. It employs more than 90,000 people worldwide and has offices in nearly every country of the world. This pharmaceutical giant holds an estimated 7 percent of the world's pharmaceutical market.\n\nConcentrating on four therapeutic areas (anti-infectives, central nervous system, respiratory and gastro-metabolic), among its most prominent products are Paxil, for depression, and Advair, for asthma. GSK is a leader in the vaccine area and has a growing portfolio of oncology products, including Hycamtin and Zofran for treating cancer. The company’s R&D budget is about $7 billion.\n\nPfizer\nPfizer is one of the world's largest consumer healthcare and pharmaceutical companies, having acquired Warner-Lambert in the year 2000. The company has three business segments: human health, animal health and consumer healthcare. The consumer business includes many of the world's best-known brands, among them Halls, Tetra, Benadryl, Sudafed, Listerine, Desitin, Schick, Visine, Bengay, Lubriderm and Zantac.\n\nMerck & Co.\nAnother leading company is Merck, a global, research-driven pharmaceutical company working toward the discovery, development, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of human and animal health products – directly and through its joint ventures. One recent partnership was initiated with another drug giant, Sanofi-Aventis SA, to become the world's largest seller of animal medications.

Make it interesting and descriptive, and remember to check for pronoun reference. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: A Wedding and 3 Confessions:\n\nWhen Laura invited me to her wedding, explaining that she wanted to gather people who'd been part of different stages of her life – some elementary school friends, including this one dude who always had her back, some from high school, neighbors from her old hood, university buddies (in my case, her thesis advisor and inferential stats prof) – so that her husband Mark and his family could experience the awesome world she'd been telling them about for the nine years she'd lived in Holland, I thought it was a fantastic idea.\n\nLaura was a bright girl who snagged a scholarship to get her master's and doctorate in Holland, something her family's finances would have never allowed.\n\nSo, she decided to have the wedding in Morelia, her parents' hometown. The ceremony was full of stuff that was just begging to become a great story. The cathedral, the mariachis, these guys on stilts, the whole shebang.\n\nThen came the dancing. Lao, as we all called her, wanted to start with music her husband, his friends, and her young cousins would dig. Dutch songs, I guess, electronic music that like thirty people were dancing and singing along to.\n\nThe Mexicans started feeling a little out of place, I gotta admit, and felt the need to even the score.\n\nThat's when Lao's friend, the one who looked out for her in elementary school – now known around his neighborhood as \"Chubby Cheeks\" – went up to the DJ and whispered something in his ear. The DJ said no, and Chubby Cheeks, by this point flanked by his two cousins, decided to give the DJ a little forehead bump and slipped his hand into his pocket, like he had a gun or something. When Chubby Cheeks told the bride he needed three tickets, she probably thought it was for his wife and two kids, not his two closest sidekicks.\n\nAnother confession I gotta make is that I might have bumped into Chubby Cheeks in the bathroom and, totally out of the blue, mentioned that the Dutch folks were kind of making us look bad, like, \"I wish someone would do something.\"\n\nSo, the DJ was kinda forced to play \"Caballo Dorado\" and \"Payasito de Rodeo,\" which surprisingly, the Dutch people also danced to, so we were still losing.\n\nBut then Los Ángeles Azules, Cañaveral, and Bronco came on, and we started to feel like we were catching up.\n\nWhen the salsa started, with Sonora Dinamita, even I got up to bust a move. How did it go again? Slide the left foot forward, bend the right behind the left, crouch down, and your partner spins around you. Yeah, that's it!\n\nLao was clueless about what was happening because she'd carefully picked all the music for months and knew this wasn't it. Mark, his family, and friends were also taken aback that the scene was so different from the \"amazing Mexico\" Lao had described.\n\nWhen the hip hop started and Molotov came on, that's when everyone sang along at the top of their lungs:\n\n\"If you give more power to the powerful\nThey're gonna screw you over even harder\nBecause we used to be a world power\nNow we're poor, they run us badly\"\n\"If they paint us as a bunch of lazy bums\nWe're not! Long live Mexico, you bastards!\nLet the Mexican power be felt!\nLet it be felt!, all together like brothers\nBecause there are more of us, we pull together better\nBecause she's following a bunch of dumbasses\"\n\nThat's when we really felt like we had the lead.\n\nThe cherry on top was when they played \"Chuntaro Style,\" and man, did we nail the \"gavilán\" dance! I can still see the bride's uncles pulling out their best moves, and Chubby Cheeks and his cousins looked like they were born in a hawk's nest.\n\nThat's when the groom's family and the newlyweds quietly dipped out, probably jet-lagged, I guess.\n\nI have to make my third confession: after that, I don't remember a thing. I woke up on a bench in front of the cathedral, just as they were calling for the 7 am mass.\n\nI'm sure Lao loved the party, and I just hope she invites us to her daughter's baptism too.", "task_id": "52a760cd-9898-4cce-bb43-c490923b2b45", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

The fuselage is the main body of the plane. It contains the passenger cabin, the cockpit for the pilots, and the cargo area. The fuselage provides stability and safety during flight.\n\nThe wings are attached on each side of the plane. They generate the lift needed for the airplane to fly. The wings are equipped with flaps and ailerons to control ascent, descent, and direction.\n\nThe tail is located at the rear of the airplane. It includes the horizontal stabilizer and the vertical fin.

It’s freeing to just let my mind wander and get everything on paper, which often sparks unexpected connections and creativity.\n  On the other hand, the questioning technique is valuable for organizing my ideas and making sure I cover all relevant aspects of a topic. By imagining the questions my readers might ask—such as who, what, why, and how—I can structure my writing clearly and logically. This helps me stay focused and ensures my writing answers important points rather than drifting off-topic.\n  While other techniques like metaphor and hyperbole are useful for adding flair and style, I think the combination of free writing to generate raw ideas and questioning to refine them suits my style best. These two techniques complement each other, making my writing both creative and coherent.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write a criticism of a celebrity. It can be a particular celebrity or the whole idea of celebrity in general. Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The concept of celebrity culture is deeply problematic, as it often elevates individuals to an undeserved level of admiration, creating a distorted sense of values. Celebrities, who are frequently celebrated for superficial traits—such as physical appearance, wealth, or social media presence—are disproportionately praised, while the true merit of their actions or contributions to society is often overlooked. This results in an unhealthy idolization, leading many to aspire to fame rather than genuine achievement or personal growth.\n\nTake, for example, the rise of influencers who gain fame through mere visibility, with little regard for the authenticity or substance of their content. Rather than offering meaningful contributions, they often perpetuate harmful trends, shallow standards of beauty, and unrealistic lifestyles. In doing so, they cultivate a culture of envy and insecurity, particularly among young, impressionable audiences.\n\nUltimately, celebrity culture promotes the idea that fame itself is a worthwhile pursuit, rather than the quality or integrity of one's work. This misplaced emphasis on public recognition over actual substance is not only misleading but also damaging to societal values.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: In our country, Robots are being used in almost all activities right from the most critical activities like military services and human surgeries to less critical tasks like cleaning homes. Nowadays, robots are seen as a member of everyone's family. Like people raise pets, they are even having at least one robot which could help them in some or the other way.\n\nRobots are very useful to perform tasks which are repetitive like industrial activities, cleaning services and many more. I predict they might even take care of elderly people in the near future. Robots ensure efficiency in every task they perform which is a very big plus for Robotic industry.\n\nHowever, Robots do affect the society negatively. People are becoming very lazy because their work is being done by Robots. Also involving Robots in critical tasks like military activities or surgeries, it is very risky to completely depend on the robots. \n\nIn Conclusion, Robots are needed to ensure efficiency in every task, at the same time, human intervention is required to ensure the robot does no wrong which could cause huge damage.", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 4}

Write 100 - 150 words. [SEP] Response: On November 13th, Cessna 123 experienced difficulties during its landing at Guarulhos. The aircraft encountered strong crosswinds, which posed significant challenges for both stability and control during the approach. Despite this, the pilot managed to execute a safe landing, although there was noticeable turbulence due to changing wind speeds, possibly Clear Air Turbulence (CAT). The pilot initially struggled to align the aircraft properly on the runway, likely due to shifting headwinds. However, by applying corrective measures, they were able to bring the aircraft down safely without incident.\n\nPost-flight inspections revealed no significant mechanical issues. It is recommended to review the wind conditions more carefully during pre-flight preparations and consider alternative runways when crosswind components are high. Additionally, further pilot training for handling adverse wind conditions is advised to improve future response.", "task_id": "0036dfef-10e2-4124-8ee7-cc03ab655ec1", "ef_level": 11.0, "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 8.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write a description, introducing the new bird species, comparing its appearance and habitat to that of the American robin, and classification using the formal zoological classification system. For the classification, suggest a name for the new species and say why it’s suitable. Use the email as reference. [SEP] Response: Positive thinking is more than just a mindset—it is a powerful tool that can transform your entire life. When you focus on the good, even in difficult situations, you train your mind to see opportunities instead of obstacles. This simple shift in perspective can improve your mood, relationships, health, and success.\n\nPeople who practice positive thinking are often more resilient. They bounce back from failure faster and learn from their mistakes. They approach challenges with confidence and believe in their ability to grow and improve. This optimism creates a sense of hope that helps them keep moving forward, even when times are tough.\n\nPositive thinking also affects physical health. Studies show that people with a positive outlook are less likely to suffer from stress-related illnesses. They often sleep better, have lower blood pressure, and enjoy better overall well-being.\n\nOf course, staying positive doesn’t mean ignoring reality or pretending that everything is perfect. It means choosing to face life with courage and faith, trusting that things can get better. It involves gratitude, self-compassion, and surrounding yourself with supportive people.\n\nYou can develop positive thinking by practicing daily affirmations, setting realistic goals, and focusing on what you can control. Even small habits like smiling more or writing down things you're thankful for can make a big difference.\n\nIn a world full of negativity and pressure, choosing positivity is a powerful act. It can change your life and inspire those around you. So, no matter where you are in your journey, remember: your thoughts have power. Choose them wisely, and you can create a brightr future—one positive step at a time.\n", "task_id": "fd6132f4-a3e2-4a63-b2d3-2336f120b95a", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 0}

It’s called cubing because it allows you to look at a topic from six sides, like a cube. It’s recommended that you spend 3-5 minutes exploring each of the ‘sides.’ First you describe it: what’s it look like? Then you compare it: what’s it similar or different to? Next, you analyze it: what’s it made of? Then you associate it: what does it remind you of? After that, you apply it: what can you do with it or use it for? And finally, argue it: take either side, and defend or attack it. This is an excellent strategy to use when you’re trying to decide how to tackle a topic at the outset, or should your ideas dry up and you come to a sudden stop.\n\nMind-mapping, webbing or clustering, as they are really one and the same thing.

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing various skills and strategies. A strong foundation in vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation is crucial, but practical application through speaking and listening activities is equally important. Effective language learning also benefits from consistent practice, exposure to authentic materials, and a willingness to embrace mistakes as part of the learning process. \nHere's a more detailed look at effective language learning:\n1. Building a Solid Foundation:\nVocabulary: Start by memorizing common words and phrases to build a basic foundation. \nGrammar: Understand the basic rules of the language, including verb conjugations, sentence structure, and tenses. \nPronunciation: Practice the sounds of the language and pay attention to intonation and rhythm. \n2. Engaging with the Language:\nListening:\nImmerse yourself in the language by listening to music, podcasts, and audiobooks. \nSpeaking:\nPractice speaking with native speakers, language partners, or by using online tools. \nReading:\nRead books, articles, and other materials in the target language to expand your vocabulary and improve comprehension. \nWriting:\nWrite short stories, essays, or emails to practice your writing skills and build fluency. \n3. Utilizing Resources and Techniques:\nLanguage Learning Apps:\nApps like Duolingo, Babbel, and Memrise offer structured lessons and interactive exercises. \nOnline Courses:\nPlatforms like Coursera and edX offer a wide range of language courses. \nImmersive Experiences:\nConsider language exchange programs, travel to a country where the language is spoken, or participate in immersion camps. \nShadowing:\nListen to native speakers and repeat what they say to improve your pronunciation and fluency. \nSpaced Repetition:\nUse techniques like flashcards or memory apps to help you remember new vocabulary and grammar rules. \n4. Consistency and Motivation:\nSet Realistic Goals: Break down your learning into smaller, manageable steps. \nBe Patient: Language learning takes time and effort, so don't get discouraged if you don't see results immediately. \nFind What Works for You: Experiment with different methods and resources to find what helps you learn best. \nMake it Fun: Find ways to enjoy the process, such as listening to your favorite music in the target language or watching movies with subtitles. \nCelebrate Your Progress: Acknowledge and celebrate your achievements to stay motivated.

Read the information you have compiled, and make notes to prepare for the writing task. Think about how you will format and set out this information using headings, numbers, bullet points, etc.. [SEP] Response: Report on Training Exercise Deficiencies and Recommendations\nIntroduction:\nThis report summarizes the deficiencies identified during the recent training exercise, with a particular focus on the PsyOps component and leaflet distribution. It also outlines recommendations for improvement based on observations and feedback gathered.\nKey Issues Identified:\n * PsyOps Disappointment: The overall execution of the PsyOps aspect of the exercise was considered disappointing and did not meet expectations given the resources invested.\n * Lack of Clarity in Objectives: The reasons for the perceived failure of the PsyOps component require further analysis to understand the underlying causes.\n * Leaflet Content Decision Delays: Late decision-making regarding the content of political messages intended for the leaflets hampered effective planning and execution.\n * Inadequate Civil Exercise Cell: The civilian exercise cell suffered from poor manning and a lack of experienced personnel, potentially involving student interns without adequate leadership.\n * Military PsyOps Team Integration: The collaboration between the civilian exercise cell and the military PsyOps team was ineffective, marked by language and communication barriers.\n * Leaflet Delivery Problems: Delays in the process led to significant issues with the timely and accurate delivery of leaflets.\n * Last-Minute Language Decisions: A last-minute decision to produce leaflets in three languages (Arabic, English, Farsi) likely contributed to logistical challenges.\n * Incorrect Leaflet Distribution: Aircraft deployed to distribute leaflets mistakenly targeted wrong areas, dropping leaflets intended for \"civilians\" on \"troops\" and vice versa during the exercise play.\n * Real-World Protests: More concerningly, the host nation and official observers lodged protests regarding the content and language of the leaflets used in the real-life portion of the exercise.\n * Post-Exercise Disputes: Violent disputes reportedly occurred between some civilian observers after the exercise, leading to diplomatic protests.\n * Poor Briefing and Understanding: The quality of briefings was inadequate, leading to a lack of understanding of exercise instructions among some personnel.\n * Instruction Compliance Issues: Exercise instructions were not consistently understood or adhered to, with instances of non-attendance, improperly issued or delayed orders, and missed deadlines.\nRecommendations for Improvement:\n * Enhance Command Structure: Implement a better command structure with clearer lines of communication and responsibility for exercise planning and execution.\n * Improve Pre-Exercise Briefings: Conduct more thorough and clearer pre-exercise briefings to ensure all personnel fully understand the objectives, instructions, and their roles.\n * Develop Language Capabilities: Invest in improving the language abilities of personnel involved in multinational exercises and PsyOps activities to facilitate better communication and understanding.\n * Strengthen Inter-National Liaison: Focus on building stronger liaison relationships and protocols with different national participants and observers to enhance collaboration and address potential sensitivities proactively.\n * Early Decision-Making for PsyOps Content: Establish a clear and timely process for developing and approving the content of political messages and leaflets well in advance of exercises.\n * Resource Civil Exercise Cell Appropriately: Ensure the civilian exercise cell is adequately staffed with experienced professionals and effective leadership to manage their responsibilities.\n * Improve Integration of PsyOps Teams: Develop strategies and protocols to foster better communication, collaboration, and integration between civilian and military PsyOps teams.\n * Refine Leaflet Production and Distribution Procedures: Review and refine the processes for leaflet production, translation, and distribution to ensure accuracy, timeliness, and correct targeting.\nConclusion:\nAddressing the identified deficiencies is crucial for the effective planning and execution of future training exercises, particularly those involving PsyOps components and multinational participation. Implementing the recommendations outlined in this report will contribute to improved coordination, communication, and overall exercise outcomes.\n", "task_id": "748c1500-c60b-435b-bc83-f09ed080e3d3", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Out of the nine writing techniques introduced, the ones I find most useful are metaphor, focused free writing, and questioning. Metaphor stands out to me because it adds depth and creativity to writing by connecting two seemingly unrelated ideas, allowing the reader to see familiar concepts in a new light. It also helps communicate emotions and abstract thoughts in a more vivid and memorable way. Focused free writing is another powerful tool because it encourages a steady flow of ideas while still keeping the writer on track with a specific topic. It’s especially helpful when I have writer’s block or am trying to develop a rough draft.\nQuestioning is also a useful technique because it helps me dig deeper into a topic and think critically about what I’m writing. Asking questions like “why,” “how,” and “what if” pushes me to explore different angles and consider the reader’s perspective. These techniques not only make writing more engaging, but they also support the development of strong, well-organized ideas.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 14.0 [SEP] Prompt: You have just received a phone call from one of your informants. Take down the key points from the information she gives you. Use the bullet points to help you. [SEP] Response: The high seas have long been associated with acts of piracy, and modern day illegal trade continues to plague international waters. These days, the high seas and its container and passenger ships remain prime suspects when it comes to the transportation of illicit goods, especially when there is a high volume of goods in question.\n\nOf course, the shipment of goods between countries is governed by many laws as part of import and export policies, and trade agreements. Every country has a list of goods which are prohibited from being shipped into the country. These can include hazardous materials like toxic waste, weapons such as guns and tanks, and endangered animals or diseased plants.\n\nThese policies are enacted to protect the physical, financial and national security of a country, but sometimes politics play a part too. For example, the importation of Cuban cigars is banned in the US because of its political relationship with that country, which has unwittingly created a demand for illegally shipped tobacco.\n\nHuman mules are contracted by drug smugglers to carry illegal drugs across international borders, either by swallowing the drugs or by otherwise hiding them on their person. Not long ago, black market goods were discovered on board a ship, hidden in insulation rolls. And in recent years, we’ve seen a rise in illegal human cargo, people who are squeezed together like sardines in a tin with no light and little air circulation, just to cross a border.\n\nIt seems smugglers will try every trick in the book to make sure their cargo is transported successfully to its destination, but border control is ever vigilant, helping to reduce the amount of illegally shipped goods that cross the border into the country.", "task_id": "e5780a8d-f6ef-4218-9d34-74e064c3e413", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 5}

It came into effect in January 1994 after years of negotiations. The main goal of NAFTA was to reduce or eliminate customs duties on goods traded between these three countries.\n\nNAFTA has significantly impacted trade relations, particularly in agriculture. For example, it allowed Mexican fruits and vegetables to be sold more easily in the US. This has benefited farmers and consumers by providing a wider variety of products at lower prices.\n\nHowever, NAFTA has had both positive and negative effects on its member countries. On the positive side, it has increased trade and economic cooperation, leading to job creation and economic growth. On the negative side, some industries have faced challenges due to increased competition, and there have been concerns about labor and environmental standards.\n\nOverall, NAFTA has played a crucial role in shaping the economic landscape of North America, influencing trade policies and economic relationships among the US, Canada, and Mexico.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in Spain can be straightforward, but it does require some preparation. The process is generally efficient, although it involves several steps and documentation.\n\nFirst, securing a mortgage typically requires proof of income and employment. You can expect to secure a loan of up to 80% of the property value. Spanish mortgage interest rates are generally competitive, ranging between 2% and 3.5%, depending on the type of mortgage and market conditions. Many banks offer both fixed and variable-rate mortgages.\n\nWhile it is not mandatory to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker, many buyers find their assistance beneficial. A real estate agent can help you find properties, negotiate, and manage the legal aspects of the transaction. A mortgage broker can assist in comparing loan offers and finding the best terms. Both professionals can help streamline the process, especially for foreigners who may not be familiar with Spanish laws and practices.\n\nThere are a number of forms to fill out throughout the process, including the mortgage application, contracts, and various legal documents required for the purchase. However, it's not overwhelmingly complicated as long as you're well-organized and have professional assistance if needed.\n\nHousing prices in Spain vary significantly by location. Major cities like Madrid and Barcelona tend to be more expensive, while rural areas or smaller towns offer more affordable options. Overall, Spain remains a relatively affordable market compared to other Western European countries.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Walking through the streets of Kolkata, one is greeted by the aroma of delicious street food, the sound of trams clattering along, and the sight of colonial-era architecture standing tall amidst modern skyscrapers. The city is a melting pot of traditions, where festivals like Durga Puja are celebrated with grandeur, and intellectual pursuits are highly valued. Kolkata's charm lies in its ability to blend the old with the new, creating a unique urban tapestry.\n\nIn contrast, Darjeeling, nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, offers a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. Known for its stunning tea gardens and panoramic views of the snow-capped mountains, Darjeeling is a haven for nature lovers. The cool, crisp air and the tranquil ambiance provide a perfect setting for relaxation and rejuvenation. The town's colonial charm is evident in its quaint cottages and the iconic Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Unlike Kolkata, Darjeeling moves at a slower pace, allowing visitors to savor the beauty of nature and the simplicity of life.\n\nIn conclusion, while Kolkata captivates with its dynamic energy and cultural richness, Darjeeling enchants with its natural beauty and peaceful atmosphere. Both places offer unique experiences, making them special in their own ways.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to make any adjustments or let me know if you need further assistance!\n", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The body of an airplane is called the fuselage. It is generally in the shape of a long narrow tube. Inside of the fuselage is the cabin of the airplane where the crew and passengers are located throughout the flight. The landing gear is stored in the bottom of the fuselage and can be retracted when the plane is going to land.\n\nOn either side of the plane are the wings. There is a slight curve to the wings which helps to push the air over the top of them, thus assisting in the flight of the aircraft. Hinged surfaces at the back of the wings are called flaps. When tilted downwards, they can increase the curve of the wing. During take off and landing, the flaps can be moved out in order to make the wing space longer.\n\nThe aircraft gets its stability partly from the tail, which is located at the back of the aircraft. The vertical part of the tail is called the fin or the vertical stabilizer. The rudder is the part at the back of the tail which can be moved to help the aircraft turn right or left.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home is a significant milestone in many people’s lives, often symbolizing financial stability and personal achievement. The process begins with assessing your budget and securing financing, usually through a mortgage. This step requires a clear understanding of your income, debts, and long-term financial goals to determine how much you can afford to spend on a property. \n\nOnce your budget is established, the search for the right home begins. Location is a critical factor, as it impacts everything from daily commute times to school quality and community safety. Additionally, the size and condition of the home are important considerations. Many buyers are looking for a balance between a property that meets their needs and one that remains a sound investment for the future.\n\nOnce you find a property, the next step is to make an offer. Negotiation plays a role here, as buyers may request repairs or adjustments to the asking price based on an inspection report. After finalizing the offer, the closing process involves signing contracts and finalizing financing.\n\nWhile buying a home can be exciting, it also comes with responsibilities, from maintenance to property taxes. It’s important to approach the decision thoughtfully and with proper guidance to ensure that it’s a positive, long-term investment.\n", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13.0 [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: \nThe debate over corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a significant one, reflecting differing perspectives on the role of businesses in society. Here's an opinion considering both sides of the argument:\n\nFor Corporate Social Responsibility:\n\nBusinesses undoubtedly have a profound impact on the communities and environments in which they operate. It is reasonable to assert that companies owe some level of responsibility to these communities, as suggested by lil@213. This view posits that business operations should be a reciprocal relationship, where communities facilitate business activities and, in return, businesses contribute positively to these communities. Additionally, sustainable operations and fair employee benefits are essential not just for ethical reasons but for pragmatic ones, ensuring long-term viability and productivity.\n\nMoreover, as Jack@MSU highlights, CSR often aligns with consumer values, thus becoming a driver of customer loyalty and ultimately benefiting the company's bottom line. In a world where consumers increasingly prioritize ethical considerations, CSR can bolster a company's reputation and foster a competitive edge. James.W@efstudent.com adds that corporations, as integral components of society, should adhere to societal expectations, which increasingly include contributions to social and environmental well-being.\n\nAgainst Corporate Social Responsibility:\n\nOn the other hand, critics like theG8T argue from a traditional economic standpoint, emphasizing that a corporation's primary duty is to its shareholders, as famously noted by economist Milton Friedman. From this perspective, businesses should focus on maximizing profits rather than attempting to meet broader social responsibilities. JackD_92 points out that CSR initiatives are often negligible compared to a company's total earnings, suggesting that they might serve more as marketing strategies rather than genuine efforts to effect change.\n\nPatty925 raises an important point about the role of government in regulating corporate behavior. The argument here is that societal welfare should primarily be safeguarded by governmental policies and laws, rather than relying on corporations to voluntarily take on these responsibilities. This perspective suggests that while businesses should comply with regulations, it is not their role to lead societal change.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, while corporations should prioritize profitability to satisfy shareholder interests, they cannot ignore their broader impact on society. CSR can provide a bridge between these objectives, offering benefits to both the community and the business itself through enhanced reputation and consumer loyalty. However, it is essential for governments to set and enforce regulations that ensure businesses contribute positively to societal goals, balancing corporate interests with public welfare. In essence, both corporations and governments have roles to play in fostering a sustainable and equitable society.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

It sounds like you're juggling a lot right now, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed.  Remember, you're not alone in this, and many people experience similar pressures.\n\nFirst, let's break down the stress.  It's crucial to identify the specific sources – is it work, relationships, finances, or a combination?  Once you pinpoint the triggers, you can start to address them more effectively.  Try writing them down; sometimes just seeing them on paper can make them seem less daunting.\n\nFor work stress, consider setting realistic goals and prioritizing tasks. Don't be afraid to delegate or ask for help when needed.  For personal stress, make time for activities you enjoy – even if it's just for a short while.  Exercise, meditation, or even just a good book can work wonders.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take breaks.  Don't feel guilty about taking time for yourself.  Even a few minutes of deep breathing or mindfulness can make a difference.  And most importantly, don't hesitate to reach out to a professional if you feel like you're struggling to cope.  Talking to someone can provide valuable perspective and support.\n\nYou're a strong person, and you'll get through this.

There’s a kind of charm in the messiness that you don’t find in Dubai.\n\nWhile Dubai is all about perfection and shine, Mumbai is more raw and real.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 8.0 [SEP] Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Wings\nFor any airplane to fly, one must lift the weight of the airplane itself, the fuel, the passengers, and the cargo. The wings generate most of the lift to hold the plane in the air. To generate lift, the airplane must be pushed through the air. The air resists the motion in the form of aerodynamic drag. Modern airliners use winglets on the tips of the wings to reduce drag. The turbine engines, which are located beneath the wings, provide the thrust to overcome drag and push the airplane forward through the air. Smaller, low-speed airplanes use propellers for the propulsion system instead of turbine engines.\n\nVertical and Horizontal Stabilizer\nTo control and maneuver the aircraft, smaller wings are located at the tail of the plane. The tail usually has a fixed horizontal piece, called the horizontal stabilizer, and a fixed vertical piece, called the vertical stabilizer. The stabilizers’ job is to provide stability for the aircraft, to keep it flying straight. The vertical stabilizer keeps the nose of the plane from swinging from side to side, which is called yaw. The horizontal stabilizer prevents an up-and-down motion of the nose, which is called pitch. (On the Wright brother’s first aircraft, the horizontal stabilizer was placed in front of the wings. Such a configuration is called a canard after the French word for “duck”).\n\nAt the rear of the wings and stabilizers are small moving sections that are attached to the fixed sections by hinges. In the figure, these moving sections are colored brown. Changing the rear portion of a wing will change the amount of force that the wing produces. The ability to change forces gives us a means of controlling and maneuvering the airplane. The hinged part of the vertical stabilizer is called the rudder; it is used to deflect the tail to the left and right as viewed from the front of the fuselage. The hinged part of the horizontal stabilizer is called the elevator; it is used to deflect the tail up and down. The outboard hinged part of the wing is called the aileron; it is used to roll the wings from side to side. Most airliners can also be rolled from side to side by using the spoilers. Spoilers are small plates that are used to disrupt the flow over the wing and to change the amount of force by decreasing the lift when the spoiler is deployed.\n\nFlaps and Spoilers\nThe wings have additional hinged, rear sections near the body that are called flaps. Flaps are deployed downward on takeoff and landing to increase the amount of force produced by the wing. On some aircraft, the front part of the wing will also deflect. Slats are used at takeoff and landing to produce additional force. The spoilers are also used during landing to slow the plane down and to counteract the flaps when the aircraft is on the ground. The next time you fly on an airplane, notice how the wing shape changes during takeoff and landing.\n\nFuselage\nThe fuselage or body of the airplane, holds all the pieces together. The pilots sit in the cockpit at the front of the fuselage. Passengers and cargo are carried in the rear of the fuselage. Some aircraft carry fuel in the fuselage; others carry the fuel in the wings.\n\nAs mentioned above, the aircraft configuration in the figure was chosen only as an example. Individual aircraft may be configured quite differently from this airliner. The Wright Brothers 1903 Flyer had pusher propellers and the elevators at the front of the aircraft. Fighter aircraft often have the jet engines buried inside the fuselage instead of in pods hung beneath the wings. Many fighter aircraft also combine the horizontal stabilizer and elevator into a single stabilator surface. There are many possible aircraft configurations, but any configuration must provide for the four forces needed for flight.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

For example, Connect Robotics uses drones for urgent deliveries, especially during emergencies. In manufacturing, robots enhance productivity and precision, reducing human error and increasing efficiency. While I don't have feelings, I understand that many people have mixed emotions about robots. On the positive side, robots can improve productivity, reduce costs, and perform dangerous or monotonous tasks, leading to safer and more efficient workplaces. However, there are concerns about job displacement, as automation can replace human workers, leading to increased unemployment and economic inequality. Additionally, the ethical implications of relying heavily on robots and AI, such as privacy issues and the potential for biased decision-making, are significant challenges.

When I was a child, most people watched the news on TV or read the newspaper in the morning; there wasn’t much digital stuff. I remember how my parents sit with a cup of coffee while breakfast, reading articles out loud sometimes. Now, everything is online. We use our phones, laptops and tablets to read, watch and listen. I get most of my news from digital newspapers, which means I read in smaller pieces. That changed my reading habits a bit; I don’t read long texts so often anymore, and sometimes I just read the headlines and skip the rest. I think it’s good that information is easier to access, but also, it makes it harder to focus. Also, I use more videos and podcasts now, not just written stuff. Reading used to be quiet and focused; now, it’s fast, loud, and a little distracting.

Com o avanço de dispositivos móveis, redes sociais e inteligência artificial, as formas de comunicação, aprendizado e até lazer foram totalmente repaginadas. No entanto, ao mesmo tempo em que essas inovações trazem benefícios incontestáveis, elas também trazem desafios que merecem atenção.\n\nUma das maiores vantagens da tecnologia é a facilidade com que podemos nos conectar com pessoas ao redor do mundo. Redes sociais, aplicativos de mensagem e videoconferências aproximam amigos, familiares e profissionais, independentemente da distância. Além disso, a internet abriu um vasto campo de conhecimento, acessível a qualquer momento, permitindo a educação contínua.\n\nNo entanto, esse uso constante da tecnologia tem suas contrapartidas. O aumento do tempo frente às telas está relacionado ao sedentarismo, distúrbios do sono e até problemas de saúde mental, como a ansiedade. Além disso, a quantidade de informações disponíveis pode ser avassaladora, o que dificulta a seleção do que é realmente relevante e confiável.\n\nPortanto, o grande desafio do século XXI é encontrar um equilíbrio saudável entre aproveitar as inovações tecnológicas e preservar o nosso bem-estar.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become a key focus for businesses today, as companies are increasingly expected to contribute to societal and environmental well-being alongside their financial success. CSR involves actions like reducing carbon footprints, supporting local communities, and ensuring fair labor practices, with the goal of creating a positive impact beyond profit-making. In this context, companies that prioritize CSR may enhance their brand image, foster customer loyalty, and attract employees who value ethical practices. Many believe that businesses have a role to play in addressing global challenges, such as climate change and poverty, by leveraging their resources and influence for good.\n\nHowever, CSR also faces criticism. One concern is that some companies use CSR as a marketing tool, engaging in \"greenwashing\" or making superficial efforts to improve their public image without committing to real, lasting change. Critics argue that CSR should not be the responsibility of businesses but rather of governments and non-profit organizations. Without clear regulations or oversight, CSR initiatives can lack transparency and fail to achieve meaningful results. Additionally, there is the issue of consumer fatigue, where people become skeptical of companies that make grand claims about their social contributions without showing substantial impact.\n\nUltimately, CSR is a complex issue, and its effectiveness depends on companies' genuine commitment to social responsibility, as well as their ability to deliver measurable, positive outcomes. It remains an open question whether CSR will evolve into a true force for good or whether it will remain more of a strategy to enhance corporate reputation. What are your thoughts—do you believe CSR is an authentic effort to make a difference, or is it just a corporate tactic to improve public image?", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

In Rio, approval was at 65%, with a smaller portion willing to purchase. Key dissatisfaction factors included design, size, color, and material. Some respondents also cited a lack of inclusivity in the product design.\n\nConclusions:\nWhile the collarless shirt concept was met with interest, overall execution failed to meet expectations. A significant portion of respondents felt the product lacked thoughtful design considerations and did not cater to diverse preferences.\n\nRecommendations:\nPrior to a wider launch, more thorough market research should be conducted, particularly into what men look for in accessories.

[SEP] Response: Strategic Summary\nZen is a unique boutique hotel concept that combines luxury accommodation with a full-service spa and health and fitness center. With a $4 million investment, Zen aims to tap into the growing trend of weekend getaways and increasing consumer focus on health and wellness, as identified by market research from AccomData Group. Unlike traditional fitness centers, which often offer unsatisfying cuisine, Zen will feature a healthy, gourmet menu crafted by top chefs from renowned restaurants. The hotel will also boast fully equipped gyms, swimming pools, and professional instructors to enhance the guest experience. Construction is estimated to take two years, with return on investment anticipated in the second year of operations. By the fifth year from opening, annual profits are projected at $1 million.\n\nRisk Assessment\nAll financial projections include considerations for potential economic downturns. In the event of a stable or growing economy, the timeline for recouping the initial investment and achieving profitability could be reduced by half. Additionally, a robust media campaign managed by Kudos Advertising Agency will help establish a strong market presence, further mitigating risks and accelerating brand recognition.", "task_id": "0efc8863-e086-4c4a-aa14-7f688dec4cb3", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13.0 [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I believe that companies absolutely have a responsibility to society, not just to their shareholders. While making a profit is necessary for any business to survive, ignoring the impact they have on communities, the environment, and their employees is short-sighted and ultimately harmful — both ethically and financially.\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is not just about giving to charity or sponsoring local events. It’s about operating in a way that is ethical, transparent, and respectful to all stakeholders — including customers, workers, suppliers, and the environment. Companies that prioritize fair wages, sustainable practices, and community support build stronger reputations and gain long-term trust from consumers.\n\nSome argue that CSR is just a marketing tactic or should be left to governments. However, waiting for laws to enforce good behavior misses the point. Doing the right thing before being forced to shows real leadership. And today’s consumers are more aware than ever — they support businesses that share their values.\n\nBesides, CSR often improves business performance. A happy workforce is more productive, and customers stay loyal to companies they respect. Profit and responsibility can go hand in hand.\n\nIn today’s global world, companies are part of society — not separate from it. They should act accordingly and use their influence for the greater good.\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Celebrity culture, while fascinating to many, often deserves criticism for promoting superficial values and unrealistic lifestyles. It cannot be denied that celebrities hold significant influence over public opinion, yet it is disappointing how frequently they use this platform irresponsibly. Far from setting meaningful examples, many celebrities seem more interested in flaunting their wealth and endorsing unattainable beauty standards. It is particularly concerning that society often elevates individuals to fame not because of their contributions or talents, but simply because of their appearance or social connections. Furthermore, the obsession with celebrity lifestyles can lead to unhealthy comparisons and materialism among young people.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 15.0 [SEP] Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning is a fascinating yet challenging journey that many students embark on. One of the primary issues they face is the complexity of grammar rules. Each language has its own set of grammatical structures, which can be confusing and difficult to master. For instance, the placement of verbs, the use of tenses, and the agreement between subjects and verbs can vary significantly from one language to another.\n\nAnother common challenge is vocabulary acquisition. Learning new words and phrases requires consistent practice and exposure. Students often struggle with retaining vocabulary, especially when they do not use the language regularly. This can lead to frustration and a sense of stagnation in their learning progress.\n\nPronunciation is also a significant hurdle. Different languages have unique sounds and intonations that may not exist in a student's native language. This can make it difficult for learners to produce accurate and natural-sounding speech. Additionally, the fear of making mistakes can hinder students from practicing speaking, which is crucial for language acquisition.\n\nCultural differences can pose another challenge. Understanding the cultural context in which a language is spoken is essential for effective communication. Students may find it difficult to grasp idiomatic expressions, social norms, and cultural references, which can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nLastly, motivation and consistency are key factors in language learning. Maintaining enthusiasm and dedication over an extended period can be tough. Students often face periods of low motivation, especially when progress seems slow. Setting realistic goals and celebrating small achievements can help sustain their interest and commitment.\n\nIn conclusion, while language learning presents several challenges, understanding and addressing these issues can lead to a more effective and enjoyable learning experience.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a trade deal between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, implemented on January 1, 1994. Its primary goal was to eliminate trade barriers, such as tariffs and import quotas, to encourage economic cooperation among the three nations. By removing these restrictions, NAFTA aimed to boost trade, create jobs, and enhance economic growth across North America.\n\nNAFTA significantly increased trade between the member countries, particularly in industries like agriculture, automobiles, and manufacturing. However, the agreement faced criticism for causing job losses in certain sectors, particularly in the U.S., as some companies relocated production to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs. Environmental and labor concerns also arose, prompting debates about the agreement’s overall impact.\n\nIn 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which introduced updates to labor laws, environmental regulations, and digital trade rules. The USMCA aimed to address some of NAFTA’s shortcomings while maintaining the core benefits of free trade among the three countries.\n\nDespite its controversies, NAFTA played a significant role in shaping North American trade and economic relations for over 25 years.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: An airplane is a complex machine made up of several important parts, each with a specific function to ensure safe and efficient flight. The fuselage is the central part of the airplane, where the cockpit, passengers, and cargo are located. It serves as the main structure and connects all the other parts.\n\nThe wings are essential for flight. They produce the lift needed to keep the airplane in the air. When air passes over and under the wings, the difference in pressure causes the airplane to rise.\n\nThe tail, also called the empennage, helps maintain the stability of the airplane during flight. It is made up of vertical and horizontal surfaces that control direction (movements to the sides and up or down).\n\nThe engines are responsible for generating the force called thrust, which propels the airplane forward. They can be located under the wings or at the rear of the fuselage, depending on the type of aircraft.\n\nEach of these parts works together to ensure that the airplane can take off, fly, maneuver, and land safely. Knowing its functions helps you understand how flight is possible, without any errors.\n\n ", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

Людина, що захоплюється красою навколишнього світу не може бути злою, вона націлена та творчість а не на руйнування.

These days an astronaut is often little more than a glorified mechanic, hurtling into the cosmos to fix the wiring in the Hubble telescope. But don't tell that to the world's first \"space tourists\"– Dennis Tito and Mark Shuttleworth. The two eccentric millionaires ponied up $20 million each for the monotony of a couple of weeks in the world's most expensive sardine cans. Scores of would-be adventurers are begging to be next.\n\nJust like those brave seafarers who risked calamity for a chance to visit the farthest corners of Earth, these trailblazers are laying the groundwork for what may eventually become a mainstay of the travel industry: mass space tourism.

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.", "task_id": "bb0d114c-9550-4f27-9138-b2eb14c39437", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 11.0 [SEP] Prompt: Now prepare the content for an informative web page about counterfeit goods. Be sure to keep the following points in mind: Types of counterfeit goods, the effect of counterfeiting on society, the signs of a fake, what to do if you discover fake goods.  Write 250-300 words. [SEP] Response: The majority of counterfeit goods are common, household like cigarettes, alcohol, perfume, DVDs, clothing, shoes and accessories, computer supplies and software, electronic goods like batteries, even toothpastes, not to mention currency, medicinal drugs, watches, jewelry, designer bags, toys that are some of the counterfeit goods you may buy.\n\nCounterfeit products may harm yourself or even be fatal, they may also provoke loss of jobs because the more consumers buy knock-off goods, the more they contribute towards job losses when the brand-name company’s profits go down. At least they make you loose time and money. This may be caused by an international counterfeiting cartel flooding the market with everything from computer software to alcohol and cigarettes until the managers are detained by the police for questioning. The multi-million dollar counterfeiting industry has a real cost on the global economy, indeed counterfeit goods comprise 5 to 7% of global trade. Big corporations contract out work to underdeveloped countries, pay the workers very low wages but charge the customers inflated prices for knock-off goods at that market. The money from counterfeited pharmaceutical products often goes towards funding the street drugs. Not only does the drug problem increase, but it also leads to more violence on the streets and gang warfare as different groups try to control the illegal drug trade.\n\nInstead of spending a day at glitzy designer stores, you are attracted by vendors selling you cheap fashionable designer handbags and accessories that you think to be trendy. It’s better to check the good you want to purchase to be sure it’s genuine. If you notice that it is made of inferior materials and it’s really cheap-looking, refuse to buy it. Fake products can be seriously dangerous because of their poor quality. A fake product often cost the same as the real thing.\n\nOne way to combat counterfeiting is for companies to use holograms because they are harder to copy. Otherwise, international companies dedicate several full-time staff working on tracking down reports of counterfeit goods, when  they are affected by the counterfeit products. On the other hand, I suggest the public buying goods only from reputable stores and outlets. Or if you decide acquiring health items on the internet, you should absolutely check out the suppliers and report anything suspicious to your local police station.\n", "task_id": "788dc6fa-5111-4a7c-b2c1-a9ddebd0b1a2", "ef_level": 11.0, "label": 2}

So when the corporation positively contributes they gain customer loyalty. Although one corporation cannot make a huge difference to the society as they cannot take care of the entire society, the collective effort of the mulitple corporation together makes a huge impact towards the society.

You can hop on a cheap flight to Lisbon, crash at a hostel, and meet people from six different countries in one night.\n\nLater in life, travel becomes more about schedules, budgets, and planning around school holidays. Right now? You can be spontaneous.\n\n2. Budget Travel Is Easier Than You Think\nContrary to what Instagram shows, travel doesn't have to be all sunsets in Bali and $300-a-night hotels. Couchsurfing, hostels, night buses, street food—there are so many ways to explore the world without selling your kidneys.\n\nApps like Skyscanner and Rome2Rio are your best friends. Want to go from Budapest to Prague for $10? Totally doable. Want free accommodation? Try Workaway or WWOOF (working on farms or helping out in hostels in exchange for food and a bed).\n\n3. You’ll Learn More Than Any Classroom Could Teach\nWhen you're traveling, every day throws something new at you. Missed a train? Learn how to problem-solve. Lost in a new city? Learn to navigate and maybe even pick up some of the local language. Arguing with your travel buddy over directions? Welcome to conflict resolution 101.\n\nTravel teaches you flexibility, patience, confidence, and communication skills—stuff no textbook can deliver.\n\n4. You’ll Make Friends From Around the World\nIt’s hard to describe the kind of bond you form with someone you’ve known for two days but climbed a mountain with at sunrise. Or the conversations you have at 2 a.m. in a hostel kitchen with someone from a totally different culture.\n\nTraveling gives you a global network—people you can visit again in the future, or who might even inspire your next adventure. Bonus: free couches to sleep on!\n\n5. You’ll Gain a Whole New Perspective\nSeeing how other people live, eat, work, and celebrate will shake up your world. You realize there's no \"right\" way to do things—just different ways. That alone makes you more open-minded and compassionate.\n\nPlus, you’ll come back home with stories, not just selfies.

Before, newspapers, magazines, and television were the most important sources of news; people relied on these traditional media to stay informed. Reading was often a slower process, and people would dedicate specific times of the day to watch the news or read a magazine. \nNow, with the rise of the internet and smartphones, I primarily use online platforms such as news websites, social media, and streaming services. These digital media are more immediate and accessible, allowing me to get updates in real-time and from a variety of sources. This shift has significantly changed my reading habits: I tend to skim headlines quickly, click on articles that interest me, and consume shorter, more frequent pieces of information. Additionally, I can read e-books and listen to podcasts, which were less common before. Overall, media has become more interactive and personalized, making it easier to stay informed and entertained, but it also requires more discernment to filter out misinformation.", "task_id": "7e0827d0-955c-484a-8c4f-81fe6a574af8", "ef_level": 11.0, "label": 5}

Your boss has asked you to summarize an article for him so that he can better talk in English about the major players in the industry. Summarize the article. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: \nDrug regulation in the U.S. has evolved significantly to protect public health. Before 1900, drug sales were largely unrestricted, often lacking medical proof. The landmark Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 mandated essential quality control, requiring manufacturers to accurately label ingredients and purity. Further strengthening oversight, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 was pivotal, demanding new drugs prove both safety and efficacy before market entry. This legislation also established crucial regulations for habit-forming substances, ensuring responsible prescribing. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strictly oversees all aspects of drug production and sales. Its responsibilities include ensuring medicines are safe and effective for their intended use, and that all labeling and packaging provide truthful, informative details. The FDA distinguishes between over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, deemed safe for general public use, and prescription medications, which require physician oversight and pharmacist dispensing. This comprehensive framework aims to safeguard consumers by controlling drug development and availability.\n", "task_id": "fc1b0754-a143-4181-840a-0f045bd66fb8", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

Eu não posso concordar, por minha militância na democratização da poesia. Democratização não é a facilitação. Não. É o convite através de uma linguagem mais simples, longe da simplória, àqueles que não têm o costume da leitura de poemas, ou usando um termo de um amigo meu: Pregar aos não convertidos. O meu sonho é que a poesia ganhe as ruas, de modo mais literal possível.\n\n        Não faço apologia à poema de má qualidade, descuidada, mas prego a diversidade de linguagem, já imaginaram as pessoas nos escritórios, nos salões de cabeleireiros, ou em qualquer outra parte conversando sobre poesia em vez de conversar sobre a novela das oito?

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is made up of several key parts, each serving a specific purpose. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane, where passengers and cargo are carried. It also houses the cockpit, where the pilots control the aircraft. The wings are attached to the fuselage and are responsible for generating lift, allowing the airplane to rise off the ground. Air flows over and under the wings, creating an upward force.\n\nAt the back of the airplane is the tail, which includes the vertical stabilizer and the horizontal stabilizer. The vertical stabilizer helps keep the airplane stable from side to side, preventing it from swaying. The horizontal stabilizer helps control the airplane’s pitch, or up-and-down movement.\n\nThe engines provide the necessary thrust to propel the airplane forward. Modern airplanes typically use jet engines, which push air out at high speeds to create forward motion. Together, these parts work in harmony to keep the airplane balanced, controlled, and flying efficiently through the air. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

The streets are alive with the sounds of rickshaws, street vendors, and conversations in Bengali. The city is rich on its literary legacy, colonial architecture, and festivals like Durga Puja. Life in Kolkata moves at a gentle pace, with a strong sense of community and warmth. Street food stalls serve spicy puchkas and kathi rolls, and the aroma of cha (tea) from roadside tea stalls fills the air.\n\nThen there is Singapore, a modern, fast-paced city known for its cleanliness, order, and cutting edge technology.

[SEP] Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.", "task_id": "2e74edfb-ed33-4ca0-b50c-d5c0ebda76b7", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 0}

An old lady even shouted, \"Hold on, young man, I’ll call the fire department!\" That’s when Tom panicked. Not wanting to be rescued like a helpless cat, he attempted to climb down himself—only to lose his grip and fall straight into a bush.\n\nLuckily, he wasn’t hurt—just covered in leaves and embarrassment. Lisa? Well, she laughed so hard that she actually agreed to go on a date with him.

For those cases where leaders fall short, civil society must come together to provide solutions, and celebrities can play a crucial role in bringing visibility to these efforts.\n\nWhen used ethically, the influence of celebrities can inspire collective action and foster empathy among people who might not otherwise feel connected to certain causes.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The aim of this report is to summarize the research that has been done about which training company is the best option to collaborate with. As you may know, the two principal candidates are TrainQuick and Skills Pro.\n\nTrainQuick remains the first option in the market, but this platform has not been widely adopted in other branches, as employees prefer other training options. One of its principal advantages is the flexibility it offers in terms of how employees can access and progress through the course. However, the chief complaint from staff members was that they disliked being placed in groups with people from other branches and preferred to have joined classes with their own colleagues. TrainQuick is, of course, favorable in terms of cost and a big reason to demonstrate to the company that we are on the same page about efficient spending this year.\n\nThe other option is Skills Pro. The major drawback of the product is its high cost; it's more expensive than TrainQuick. By contrast, the staff who have been taking this course often finish it successfully, even though most employees said that the content was difficult. One other point to be aware of is that they plan to expand the course, which would allow us to demonstrate that we are investing in the company with a more long-term perspective.\n\nIn short, even though Skills Pro is more expensive, the fact that they will expand the course and the course completion percentage is better indicates that Skills Pro represents the best option for us.", "task_id": "28757296-8797-428f-a562-0b03c304b341", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 4}

Imagine this: he was hiking alone in the remote mountains of New Zealand when he stumbled upon an ancient cave hidden among the cliffs. Curiosity getting the better of him, he ventured inside and discovered a chamber filled with mysterious artifacts that seemed straight out of a lost civilization.\n\nAs he explored further, my friend uncovered a series of intricate carvings on the cave walls, depicting scenes of a forgotten era. Among the relics were relics of a language that he couldn't decipher and tools that hinted at advanced craftsmanship for their time. The discovery left him in awe, feeling like an archaeologist unraveling the secrets of the past.\n\nWhat makes this story even more incredible is that my friend, an avid outdoorsman with a passion for history, had always dreamed of finding something like this but never expected it to happen.

Focus groups can be difficult to manage, as dominant individuals may influence the group’s opinions, and participants may not always express their true thoughts in a group setting. Surveys can suffer from low response rates, especially when conducted online or by mail, and responses may be superficial or inaccurate due to misunderstanding or lack of interest.

We evaluated two companies: TrainQuick and Skills Pro.\n\nTrainQuick, while cost-effective and flexible, has a significant drawback: low adoption in other branches.  Employee feedback indicates resistance to mixed-branch classes, suggesting potential cultural or quality mismatches.  This low utilization negates the benefits of its flexibility and lower cost.\n\nSkills Pro, though more expensive, offers a higher quality training program.  While the course content is considered challenging, the high success rate among participants demonstrates its effectiveness.  This rigorous approach is likely to yield better long-term results through improved employee skills and performance.  Furthermore, Skills Pro's plan to expand its course offerings indicates a commitment to growth and a wider range of relevant training options in the future.\n\nWhile the higher cost of Skills Pro is a factor to consider, the superior quality, high success rate, and future expansion potential make it a worthwhile investment.  A cost-benefit analysis, comparing the return on investment of improved employee skills against the training cost, is recommended.

There was a faint, melodic sound coming from deeper within the forest. Curiosity piqued, he decided to follow the sound, veering off the main path. The further he went, the louder the music became, until he stumbled upon a hidden clearing.\n\nTo his amazement, the clearing was filled with people dressed in vibrant, medieval costumes.

For your questions about employees motivations, I would like to share my thoughts. Here are three ideas that I learnt from my experiences as a manager.\n1. Act as a mentor: your team members are not fully skillful. They are on the way of learning. You can recommend them some trainings based on their interests and goals for career. \n2. Listening is the Key: Try to take more time for communication. Listen what they think and feel in the everyday work. They will open up their heart to you if you are next to them with respect.\n3. Give them work-life balance: Employees are always more productive after vacation. For the powerful team work, you are responsible to support for vacation leave for the each team member.\n\nAlso, here are 2 ideas for NOT to do:\n 1. Do not be bossy: never forget to respect each other. You have to be better human before being a manager.\n2. Do not treat unfairly: our employees are smart enough to realize if a manager is not  fair.\n\nPlease reach me any time again. thanks.", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 4}

Often depicted as a half-land, half-aquatic beast, the Makara is a powerful symbol in Hindu and Buddhist mythology. It is said to be the vahana (vehicle) of Ganga, the river goddess, and also guards temple gateways as a protector from evil.\nWhat makes the Makara truly captivating is its hybrid-form - it often combines the body of a crocodile with the trunk of an elephant, the tail of a fish an the jaws of a shark. Depending on regional interpretations, it can also have features of a stag, lion, or peacock, creating a majestic, almost dreamlike creature that defines natural classification.\nIt embodies both ferocity and grace- a creature of the depths yet revered as devine. More than just a myth, the Makara represents transformation and the unknown, reminding us that even in chaos, beauty and protection can co-exist.

Usually, a lender will require it as protection against your mortgage, but if you pay for your property in cash, it is up to you to decide what risks you want to face, or in other words, how peacefully you can sleep at night. Insurance is a business, and like every business, insurance companies assess their own risk management, which includes identification, evaluation, control, and review. It is mainly for this reason (economic sustainability) that they do not offer insurance for natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, or nuclear accidents.

If a cyberattack hits, or electronics fail mid-voyage, a ship’s only fallback could be those analog tools—and the crew’s ability to use them.\nSome navies and shipping companies use a hybrid approach, leaning heavily on e-nav but requiring proficiency in traditional methods. It's kind of like flying with autopilot on—you still want a pilot who knows how to land manually.\nSo maybe it’s less about replacing and more about complementing.

The landlord has just notified me that next month's rent will increase by 25%, raising it to $4,500 a month. That’s an additional $54,000 annually, which will significantly impact our profits.\n\n You prefer to stay put despite the higher rent, arguing that our location in a trendy district and downtown accessibility are key benefits. However, our clothing sales are not growing as fast as our expenses, and with the rapid development in Centerville.\n\nI’ve been leaning towards a different approach—relocating to the south end of town for production and implementing a system to meet clients at their offices or schools for fittings. This would also involve upgrading our website to allow online measurement submissions and clothing selection. This shift could lead to substantial cost savings, but we'd lose the physical showroom that enables customers to experience our products firsthand and receive personalized service.\n\nAnother idea we might consider is a hybrid model. We could negotiate a short-term lease in a more affordable location while we test our new system for fittings and online sales. This would allow us to assess the viability of this approach without committing fully to the higher rent or completely abandoning our current setup. It would also give us time to gather customer feedback and make adjustments as needed.\n\nLet’s discuss this possibility and explore it further. We definitely need to make a choice soon", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 4}

The guardian tree shared tales of the forest's magical history and warned Alex of a looming threat that could disturb the delicate balance of nature.\nIn gratitude for Alex's respectful presence, the tree bestowed upon them a mystical amulet, said to grant protection and wisdom.

The family was distressed and terrorized by the incident. While there was no mention of stolen valuables, the defendant admitted to ransacking the house. Medina claimed he believed the house was empty and entered at night out of fear, seeking shelter.\n\nThe court ruled that trespassing is a criminal offense and imposed a fine of $1,000, payable in two installments—one immediately. Additionally, Medina was sentenced to 300 hours of community service.\n\nThe verdict appears appropriate, as unlawful entry into someone’s home is a serious offense that causes emotional distress. While Medina’s intent may not have been to harm or steal, his actions justified legal consequences. The combination of a fine and community service serves as both punishment and rehabilitation, deterring future offenses while offering an opportunity for Medina to contribute positively to society.\n\n", "task_id": "bb0d114c-9550-4f27-9138-b2eb14c39437", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: How to Develop Leadership Qualities\n\nI believe leadership is something we can all develop with time and effort. In my personal experience, one important quality of a good leader is responsibility. A leader needs to take responsibility not only for their own actions but also for the people they work with. I once worked on a team project at school, and our leader was someone who always supported us and made sure we all understood what to do. He didn’t blame anyone when things went wrong. Instead, he helped us find solutions. That experience showed me that patience and good communication are also very important.\n\nAnother key quality is confidence, but not arrogance. A leader should trust their decisions but also listen to others. I think kindness and respect are important too. People follow leaders they trust and respect.\n\nIn my opinion, everyone has the potential to be a leader. Some people are natural leaders, but others can learn through practice and experience. Leadership is not about being the boss; it’s about helping others and making good decisions for the group.", "task_id": "ce3f3898-f2a7-4978-8f4f-17596f229f1d", "ef_level": 12.0, "label": 4}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Getting a car for your 16th birthday is still a common practice in the United States, and most Americans are used to having an independent means of transport. However, recent studies have shown a change in behavior that suggests, in the future, there will be fewer cars on the road and an increase in the use of public transport.\n\nOne reason for this change is that young professionals have become so attached to their electronic gadgets (for example, cellphones and hand-held listening devices) that they’d rather give up the privilege of driving than that of instant entertainment and communication. They also feel that they can be more productive if they work during their commute rather than sitting in traffic wasting time.\n\nAnother contributing factor to this trend is the issue of sustainability. The environment has become a much higher profile issue in recent years, and the development of public transport into a greener and more convenient option, especially in major cities, has led to a significant rise in its use by younger generations. Furthermore, by taking public transport, commuters save a significant sum of money every year.\n", "task_id": "ff0155e4-a137-4a41-a7b2-ebeaf0213c72", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a landmark trade pact signed in 1992 by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, which came into effect on January 1, 1994. NAFTA aimed to eliminate most tariffs and trade barriers on products and services exchanged between these three countries, effectively creating one of the largest free-trade zones in the world. The agreement facilitated the free movement of goods, services, and investments, leading to increased economic integration and cooperation among the member countries. NAFTA's provisions included the gradual reduction of tariffs, customs duties, and other trade barriers, with some tariffs being removed immediately and others over a period of up to 15 years. The agreement also ensured duty-free access for a wide range of manufactured goods and commodities. While NAFTA significantly boosted trade and investment among the member countries, it also faced criticism and political opposition, particularly concerning its impact on employment and the environment. Despite these challenges, most economic analyses indicated that NAFTA was beneficial to the North American economies and the average citizen. In 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which updated and revised many of the original provisions to better address contemporary trade issues", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

The couple revealed that they were once renowned explorers who had settled in the cabin to enjoy a peaceful life.\n\nThe next morning, the couple helped Alex fix the car and provided directions to the nearest town.

[SEP] Response: Dear Investors,\nThis is to explain my proposal of the acquisition of a 'boutique' hotel, which also includes a spa and a health and fitness center for 4 million. \nAfter an exhaustive market analysis undergone by AccomData Group, we have observed that there are growing trends in weekend getaways to relaxing resorts and the healthy lifestyle is gaining traction.\nThere is also an opportunity of covering a gap of healthy cuisine offer in the hotel as most fitness centers do nor fulfil the customer’s expectations. So, our proposal is to include a high-quality healthy menu in our hotel with top chefs.\nWe will also include a fully equipped gyms and swimming pools with trained instructors not only for hotel’s clients. So, this will increase the number of customers.\nWe estimate 2-year construction time and the ROI second year after opening with a projected profit per year after the second year of $1 million.\nTherefore, the estimated time for recouping investment will be four years from opening and with a profit starting of five years from the opening.\nWe have also evaluated the risk and any economic downturn has been factored into the above figures.\nOur forecast indicates that if the economy remains stable, the period required for recouping investment and realizing profits could be cut in half.\nAs one of the main actions in the short/ middle term, we propose an intensive media campaign planned by Kudos Advertising Agency with a long experience in lifestyle and hotels’ communication campaigns.\nI hope this proposal suits you and I am at your disposal to schedule a meeting for discussing the details.\n\nSincerelly,\n\nXX", "task_id": "0efc8863-e086-4c4a-aa14-7f688dec4cb3", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 4}

The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot.

The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a crucial aspect of modern business practices. It refers to companies taking responsibility for their impact on society and the environment, beyond their financial performance. Here’s my perspective on the importance of CSR:\n\nIntroduction: CSR is not just a buzzword; it is a fundamental component of sustainable business practices. Companies that embrace CSR can create a positive impact on society while also enhancing their own long-term success.\n\nArgument 1: One of the primary benefits of CSR is the improvement of a company's reputation. When businesses engage in ethical practices, support community initiatives, and reduce their environmental footprint, they build trust and loyalty among consumers. This positive image can lead to increased customer retention and attract new clients who prioritize ethical consumption.\n\nArgument 2: CSR initiatives can also lead to operational efficiencies and cost savings. For example, adopting sustainable practices such as reducing waste, conserving energy, and sourcing materials responsibly can lower operational costs. These savings can then be reinvested into the business or used to further CSR efforts, creating a virtuous cycle of improvement.\n\nArgument 3: Furthermore, CSR can enhance employee satisfaction and retention. Employees are increasingly seeking to work for companies that align with their personal values. By demonstrating a commitment to social and environmental responsibility, companies can attract and retain top talent, leading to a more motivated and productive workforce.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, CSR is not only beneficial for society and the environment but also for the businesses themselves. By integrating CSR into their core strategies, companies can build a positive reputation, achieve cost savings, and foster a loyal and motivated workforce. Embracing CSR is a win-win for all stakeholders involved.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

The moment you step into Manhattan, you feel the rush—bright lights, honking taxis, street performers, and people from all over the world. There’s always something happening, whether it's a Broadway show, a late-night diner, or a cultural festival in Queens. The city never sleeps, and that constant movement is what makes it exciting.\n\nThen there’s Kyoto—a place of calm, history, and quiet beauty. Unlike the skyscrapers of New York, Kyoto is filled with traditional temples, bamboo forests, and peaceful tea houses. Time feels slower there. People bow politely, streets are clean and quiet, and the atmosphere encourages reflection. Kyoto is a city that respects its past, offering a peaceful contrast to New York’s forward-looking drive.\n\nWhile New York inspires with its ambition and energy, Kyoto soothes with its grace and tradition. One is fast-paced and loud, the other calm and contemplative. I love them both, but for different reasons. New York is where I go to feel alive, and Kyoto is where I go to feel at peace.", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Topic: Influencer Marketing\n\nWith the spread of social media, new marketing strategies have been adopted in recent years. One of them is influencer marketing by celebrities, which is a collaboration between popular social-media users and brands to promote brands’ products or services. To be more spefic, a celebrity visits some restaurants and posts food reviews and restaurant reviews on social media. The general rule is to clearly indicate that the food review is an advertisement.\n\nThe problem is that some influencers don't follow the rules. In case that they do not indicate that the article is an advertisement, the article is illegal and called as Stealth Marketing. By disguising the information as an advertisement, consumers mistakenly believe that the information is an objective opinion or a personal experience. This is a deceptive act. Influencers and celebrities need to have a good understanding of the rules and laws regarding information dissemination.\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 4}

What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Developing leadership qualities involves a combination of self-awareness, continuous learning, and practical experience. From what I've observed, effective leaders often exhibit qualities such as empathy, integrity, and resilience. Empathy allows leaders to understand and connect with their team, fostering a supportive and collaborative environment. Integrity builds trust and sets a strong ethical foundation, while resilience helps leaders navigate challenges and setbacks with a positive attitude.\n\nOne key aspect of developing leadership is self-reflection. Regularly assessing your strengths and areas for improvement can guide your growth. Seeking feedback from peers and mentors also provides valuable insights. Additionally, embracing opportunities for learning, whether through formal education, workshops, or reading, can enhance your leadership skills.\n\nPractical experience is crucial. Taking on leadership roles in various settings, such as volunteer organizations or project teams, allows you to apply and refine your skills. It's also important to observe and learn from other leaders, noting what strategies and behaviors are effective.\n\nI believe everyone has the potential to be a leader, though the path may look different for each person.

About Office Bravo a big con is that it's too far from the city.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Office One is the best choice for a new office location for the company. It would be the most convenient, and it would keep associates happy. We suggest that we have a meeting next week to review this proposal.

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, several stand out as particularly useful. Metaphor is invaluable for creating vivid imagery and making abstract concepts more relatable. By comparing one thing to another, metaphors can enhance understanding and add depth to writing. Hyperbole, or deliberate exaggeration, is effective for emphasizing a point or conveying strong emotions, making the writing more engaging and impactful. Symbolism allows writers to imbue their work with deeper meanings, using symbols to represent ideas or themes, enriching the narrative.\n\nFree writing and focused free writing are excellent for overcoming writer's block and generating ideas. Free writing encourages a flow of thoughts without self-censorship, while focused free writing narrows the scope to a specific topic, aiding in clarity and direction. Loop writing helps in refining ideas by revisiting and expanding on initial thoughts. Listing is a practical technique for organizing ideas and ensuring all relevant points are covered. Questioning stimulates critical thinking and exploration of different perspectives. Lastly, cubing involves examining a topic from multiple angles, providing a comprehensive understanding.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: Steady Surge: Hang Seng Index Rises on Mainland Momentum\n\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI) has enjoyed a strong upward trend over the past six months, buoyed by growing investment from Mainland China. After dipping to 20,956 half a year ago, the HSI rebounded sharply, reaching a recent high of 27,499 — a significant gain that has caught the attention of investors across Asia.\n\nMuch of this growth can be attributed to impressive performances in the Properties and Utilities sub-indices. As China’s economy continues to expand, its ripple effects have boosted Hong Kong-based companies in these sectors. Analysts point to both the influx of capital from the mainland and rising domestic demand within Hong Kong as key drivers of this rally.\n\nLooking ahead, market experts remain optimistic. With global investors increasingly turning their eyes toward Asia, and local consumption remaining strong, many predict the Hang Seng will continue its upward trajectory into the next year.

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning is a rewarding but often challenging journey. Students face a variety of difficulties, both practical and emotional. One of the main issues is motivation. Why do some learners give up after a few months? Often, they expect fast results and become discouraged when progress feels slow. Consistency is another challenge—how can learners stay committed with busy schedules and competing priorities?\n\nAnother common difficulty is pronunciation and speaking. Many students feel nervous or embarrassed to speak in a new language, especially when they're afraid of making mistakes. What strategies can help them build confidence? Practice with native speakers, accepting errors as part of the process, and focusing on communication instead of perfection can all be useful.\n\nGrammar and vocabulary also present obstacles. How can students remember so many new words and rules? Using the language in real contexts, rather than just memorizing lists, often helps. For example, reading books, watching shows, and using apps can make learning more natural and enjoyable.\n\nFinally, cultural differences can be confusing. Idioms, humor, and nonverbal cues may not translate well. How can learners better understand these aspects? Immersing themselves in the culture, even virtually, can deepen their understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, language learning is full of challenges, but with the right mindset and tools, students can overcome them and enjoy the many benefits of becoming multilingual.\n", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: To be honest, I find the whole idea of celebrity culture somewhat troubling. While I appreciate that many celebrities work hard and have genuine talent, I’m bound to say that the level of attention they receive often seems excessive. For example, the media tends to focus more on what celebrities wear or who they are dating rather than their actual work. This creates unrealistic standards and encourages people, especially young fans, to value appearance and fame over substance. I can’t help but feel that this obsession with celebrity lives distracts us from more important issues. That said, I do recognize that some celebrities use their platform for good causes, which is commendable. However, I would argue that society should be more critical of how much influence we allow them to have. To put it mildly, the constant glorification of celebrity lifestyles can lead to unhealthy comparisons and a distorted sense of reality. Overall, while celebrities can inspire, we should be careful not to idolize them blindly.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

While rearranging some furniture, he accidentally knocked over a dusty bookshelf—revealing a small, barely noticeable door in the wall. At first, he thought it was just a storage closet, but when he pried it open, it led to a dimly lit passageway.\n\nWith his heart pounding, Leo stepped inside, flashlight in hand. The passage was narrow, lined with brick, and extended deeper than he had expected. It eventually opened into a hidden room filled with antique furniture, old letters, and a collection of strange artifacts. It was like stepping into another era.\n\nAfter some research, he discovered that the apartment had once belonged to a historian, rumored to have kept private collections from long-forgotten events. The discovery made the place feel more alive—as if it had stories waiting to be uncovered.", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

My name is Tania, and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to introduce you to our company. Today, I will share with you the story of Frisko Shipping, our achievements, and what we expect from our new recruits.\n\nLet me start by giving you a brief history of our company. Frisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko. From humble beginnings, we have grown to have locations in 20 cities all over the world and employ more than 5,000 dedicated individuals. Last year, we achieved a profit of 5 million dollars and captured 10 percent of the global market. These milestones are a testament to our commitment to excellence and innovation.\n\nNow, I would like to share an interesting anecdote about our founder, Bill Frisko. Many of you might not know this, but Bill's inspiration to start Frisko Shipping came from a life-changing experience. One day, while sailing, Bill fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. Fortunately, a passing ship saved his life. This event sparked the idea of starting his own shipping company, driven by the belief that inspiration can be found in the most unexpected places.\n\nAs new members of the Frisko Shipping family, we expect you to bring motivation and enthusiasm to your roles. To make this session interactive, we will hold a quiz to see how much you already know about the company. Remember, your journey here is just beginning, and we are excited to see the unique contributions each of you will make.\n\nThank you for your attention, and let's make this an incredible journey together!", "task_id": "5c89b5ef-f9e4-44c0-bd77-31ed1d856ff0", "ef_level": 11.0, "label": 5}

It’s refreshing to see a public figure who stays grounded despite his success. He consistently avoids the spotlight and does not seek attention through scandals or luxury.\n\nWhat I admire most about Keanu Reeves is how he treats people with respect, regardless of their status. Stories of him giving up his seat on the subway or donating large portions of his salary to crew members show his true character. He seems to value kindness and professionalism over ego and fame.\n\nSome might say he is too quiet or private to be a celebrity, but I believe that’s exactly what makes him so special. He challenges the stereotype of the arrogant Hollywood star and reminds us that being famous doesn’t mean being self-centered.\n\nIn conclusion, Keanu Reeves is a positive example of what a celebrity can and should be.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility: A Necessity, Not an Option\n\nThe debate over corporate social responsibility (CSR) highlights a fundamental question: should businesses focus solely on profits, or do they owe something to society? While some argue that corporations should prioritize shareholder value, I believe CSR is not only morally justified but also strategically beneficial.  \n\nCompanies operate within societies, drawing resources, labor, and infrastructure from the communities they serve. In return, they have an ethical obligation to give back. Investing in sustainable practices, fair wages, and community development builds trust and goodwill, strengthening long-term relationships with both employees and customers. For instance, as Jack@MSU points out, companies with strong CSR records enjoy greater customer loyalty, which translates into higher profitability.  \n\nMoreover, CSR fosters innovation and resilience. Addressing environmental challenges, for example, can lead to cost savings and the development of new technologies. Businesses that integrate CSR into their strategies are better equipped to adapt to changing regulations and social expectations.  \n\nCritics argue, like theG8T, that businesses should focus solely on profit and leave societal welfare to governments. However, this perspective ignores the interconnectedness of modern economies. Governments may set regulations, but corporations have the resources and influence to drive progress faster and more effectively.  \n\nIn conclusion, CSR is not just philanthropy; it’s a long-term investment in stability and growth. By embracing social responsibility, companies can secure both public trust and financial success.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

Conversely, in Shanghai, approval was much higher at 80%, with 40% indicating they would purchase. The main reasons for disapproval in both cities included issues with design, size, color, and material.

The higher approval in Shanghai suggests potential if improvements are made. Key factors influencing acceptance include design details, size, color options, and material quality.\n\nRecommendations:\nFurther research is needed to understand customer preferences, focusing on design details like stitching and color.

[SEP] Response: Developing leadership qualities is a journey that takes time, self-awareness, and a willingness to grow. From my experience, leadership starts with taking responsibility not just for yourself, but for the people around you. I remember leading a small project in school where we had to organize an event. At first, I was unsure, but I learned that listening to others and staying calm under pressure made a huge difference. I wasn’t the smartest or the loudest, but I tried to be dependable and encouraging.\n\nSome of the most important leadership qualities include honesty, communication, empathy, and confidence. A good leader doesn’t just give orders they understand people’s strengths, support their team, and set an example.\n\nI believe everyone has the potential to be a leader, but not everyone develops it. Leadership is not about a title it’s about influence and attitude. It can show up in small ways, like helping classmates or being the one who keeps a group motivated.

[SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in Italy can be a complex process, especially for first-time buyers. The first step is usually to find a suitable property, often with the help of a real estate agent. In most cases, people prefer to use an agent because they can guide buyers through the legal and bureaucratic steps, which can be overwhelming.\n\nOnce a property is chosen, the next step is applying for a mortgage. This involves preparing a lot of paperwork, including proof of income, bank statements, tax returns, and identification documents. Banks in Italy are very strict about checking the financial stability of applicants. Generally, the bank will only approve a loan if the monthly payment does not exceed 30-35% of the borrower’s income.\n\nInterest rates can vary depending on the type of loan. Fixed rates are more stable but usually slightly higher, while variable rates can be lower at first but may increase over time. As of 2024, average interest rates for mortgages in Italy are around 3-4%.\n\nOverall, housing in Italy can be expensive, especially in major cities like Milan and Rome.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Cubing and loop writing are both creative techniques used in the fields of writing and thinking to organize and develop ideas.\nCubing is a method inspired by the idea of looking at an object from all six sides. In writing, it involves exploring a topic from six different perspectives to gain a more comprehensive understanding. These perspectives include describing, comparing, associating, analyzing, applying, and arguing. For example, when writing about a historical event, a writer might first describe the event, then compare it to similar events, analyze its causes and effects, and argue its significance. Cubing helps expand ideas and allows for a more multidimensional approach to a topic, fostering deeper thinking and more nuanced writing.\nLoop writing is a technique in which a writer continually refines and revises their work through repeated drafts. In loop writing, a writer begins with a basic idea or rough draft and then revises it in loops, each time deepening the focus or expanding on specific details. The process can help clarify ideas, improve structure, and strengthen arguments. It's particularly effective for exploring new concepts, allowing writers to see connections between thoughts that may not have been apparent in the initial draft.\nBoth cubing and loop writing encourage flexible, iterative thinking, offering structured ways to enhance creativity and thoughtfulness in writing.\n", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Let me share an inspiring story with you. Bill’s passion for shipping didn’t come from a boardroom meeting or a business plan—it came from an extraordinary experience at sea. Many years ago, Bill fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. Miraculously, a passing ship saved him. That moment sparked the idea to create Frisko Shipping, a company driven by resilience, passion, and innovation.\n\nAs new recruits, you’re expected to bring that same energy and enthusiasm to our team. We want you to think creatively, solve problems, and make a real impact.\n\nTo wrap up, I’d like you to think about your own journey with Frisko Shipping. How will you contribute to our growth? What inspires you to push boundaries and make waves in the shipping world?\n\nLet’s make this an exciting ride together.

[SEP] Response: One legendary creature that fascinates me is the Naga, a mythical serpent-like being from Indian mythology. Nagas are often depicted as half-human, half-serpent, and are believed to inhabit the underworld, as well as bodies of water like rivers, lakes, and seas.\n\nIn Hindu and Buddhist traditions, Nagas are considered powerful and wise beings. They are often associated with water and fertility, and are believed to control the rain and rivers. Some stories portray them as protectors of treasures and sacred places, while others depict them as dangerous and vengeful if provoked.\n\nOne of the most famous Nagas is Shesha, also known as Ananta, who is said to be the king of all Nagas. Shesha is often depicted as a massive serpent with multiple heads, serving as the bed for the god Vishnu during his cosmic slumber. Another well-known Naga is Manasa, the goddess of snakes, worshipped for protection from snake bites and for fertility.\n\nThe Naga's dual nature as both benevolent and malevolent makes them a complex and intriguing figure in Indian mythology, embodying the balance between creation and destruction.\n\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

I unpacked the snacks and enjoyed a quiet moment, appreciating the serenity around me. It felt rejuvenating to disconnect from my daily routines.

A degradação ambiental, impulsionada por atividades como o desmatamento, a exploração mineral e a agricultura predatória, representa uma ameaça grave a esse ecossistema.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has sparked considerable debate, with arguments both for and against the idea that companies should prioritize social and environmental concerns alongside profits. However, I strongly believe that CSR is not just a moral obligation—it is a business necessity.\nCompanies exist within a broader social framework, and their operations directly impact communities, employees, and the environment. Ignoring these responsibilities can lead to public backlash, reduced consumer trust, and long-term financial losses. Businesses that engage in ethical practices—such as fair wages, sustainable sourcing, and community support—build stronger relationships with their stakeholders. As one contributor, Jack@MSU, pointed out, CSR makes good business sense because consumers care. A company that demonstrates genuine social commitment is often rewarded with customer loyalty, enhanced brand reputation, and even increased profitability.\nOn the other hand, some argue that a corporation’s sole duty is to maximize profits for shareholders, as Milton Friedman famously stated. While profitability remains a priority,ethical business conduct can contribute to financial success rather than hinder it. Companies that embrace CSR attract top talent, reduce regulatory risks, and foster innovation by investing in sustainable solutions.\nUltimately, businesses should not view CSR as a burden but as an opportunity—an investment in long-term success, societal well-being, and environmental sustainability. Responsible companies don’t just thrive; they shape a better world for future generations.\n\n\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

Compare your notes with the model text at the end. [SEP] Response: NTASIA – Background Information for Deploying Units\n\nThe situation in the Federation of Pantasia began to cause the international community concern a year ago when an election resulted in a vote to break up the federation and form two separate countries for its two main ethnic groups, the Alphas and the Betas. Fighting broke out for control of the mineral-rich Argos Region, as well as between certain minority groups who were made refugees. There is also evidence of an attempt at ethnic cleansing of a minority group.\n\nSix months ago the military staged a coup to reunite the Federation. Although a large portion of the armed forces have returned to Federal control, elements have remained loyal to the new governments of Alpha and Beta. These armies have had small battles between themselves over disputed territories while resisting operations by the Federal forces based in Federal Territory.\n\nUntil a month ago the situation was a stalemate, however, the various factions have been rearming under the pretence of negotiations. Recently, strong leadership in Beta has resulted in a campaign that has pinned down Federal forces and Beta forces have also launched an all-out attack through Alpha territory to seize valuable land in Argos.\n\nThis has resulted in considerable civilian casualties, refugees and dislocation of population. There are reports of executions, rape, destruction of property and infrastructure. It is also believed that Beta has established concentration camps as part of its ethnic cleansing policy.", "task_id": "cffee9ec-0e17-4031-aeca-2723113def03", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: After evaluating two potential training companies, we have the following observations:\n\nTrainQuick offers a budget-friendly option with a flexible schedule, which could be attractive to employees who need training around their work commitments. However, feedback from other branches indicates that it isn’t widely used, and employees have expressed dissatisfaction with the idea of mixing with staff from different branches in their training sessions. This could lead to less personalized attention or a lack of camaraderie among colleagues, which we’ve found is important for the success of such programs.\n\nOn the other hand, Skills Pro is a more expensive option, but it comes with its own set of advantages. While some employees have noted that the course material can be difficult, those who stick with it often complete the program successfully. Skills Pro also plans to expand its offerings in the future, potentially making it a long-term investment for our employees’ growth.\n\nConsidering all factors, it seems that Skills Pro would be the better choice overall. While it comes at a higher price, the quality of the courses and the higher completion rates are likely to provide more value in the long run.\n\n", "task_id": "28757296-8797-428f-a562-0b03c304b341", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 5}

He is known as the guardian of the forests and their animals, protecting them from hunters and anyone who tries to harm nature. His most striking characteristic is his feet, which are turned backward, serving to confuse those who pursue him by leaving tracks that lead in the opposite direction of his actual movement. The legend describes Curupira as a short being with red or fiery hair, who moves with great agility through the forest. He uses whistles and shouts to frighten and disorient invaders, guiding them away from his territory. Those who disrespect the forest or hunt predatorily are targets of his tricks and punishments. The story of Curupira is an important element of Brazilian popular culture, conveying values of respect and environmental preservation.

[SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in India can be both exciting and challenging. The process involves several steps, including property selection, legal verification, and loan application. Housing prices vary widely depending on the city and location.

They can simplify the search but come with additional costs. Mortgage brokers, while less common, can assist in comparing loan options.\n \nOverall, the process of buying a home is moderately difficult due to high property prices in urban areas and the complexity of legal and financial formalities.

Among the negative effects are the environmental damage and the increased immigration from Mexico to the US and increased wage inequality. \n\nDespite the overall negative effects, NAFTA translates into benefits for all three members, such as increased trade between Canda, Mexico and the US, economic growth in the three countries and reduced tariffs, making easier for companies to trade across borders. \n", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 4}

The rent increase is certainly a significant challenge, and I agree that we need to decide soon.\n\nYour proposed model of relocating production to the south end and leveraging a more robust online presence is innovative and could open up new avenues for cost savings and accessibility. However, the concern about losing the personalized showroom experience is valid, as it has been a key strength of our business.\n\nOn the other hand, staying downtown has its merits with our established customer base and visibility, but the rising costs could make it unsustainable.\n\nHow about considering a hybrid model? We could keep a smaller downtown space primarily as a showroom and consultation area while relocating production. This might allow us to retain our personal touch and high visibility while cutting some costs. Additionally, investing in a stronger online presence would support both models, attracting a broader customer base.\n\nI suggest we consult a business strategist or local small business advisors to explore creative solutions. We could also seek feedback from our loyal customers about these potential changes.\n\nLet me know your thoughts!\n\nBest regards,\nJosh\n\n", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

I would like to start by saying that your situation is not uncommon, lots of people suffer from an imbalance in their lifestyles and that affects the health of body and mind. But, don't worry, it is completely fixable! with small changes in your everyday routine, and a serious commitment to standup for your wellbeing, you will very soon recover the energy and enthusiasm to live. Let's start by focusing on the critical aspects: food and sleep. These two will have the most powerful impact in your stamina and mood. I would recommend that you decrease the amount of caffeine that you ingest, start by decreasing the number of cups that you drink in a day, but aim to completely switch coffee for non-caffeinated beverages. Mint tea is particularly helpful to keep the mind sharp without affecting your sleep cycle. Sleep deprivation also affects your appetite and your anxiety levels, so as you start getting more hours of quality sleep you will start noticing that you have less craves for sugar and carbohydrates and also your stress levels will reduce, take this opportunity to try reduce your smoking habit, overcoming an addiction is a big challenge so take it slowly, but steady. Regarding the food, it is ok if you can't cook, but consciously choose healthier options for take out for most days of the week, and at home have some easy-to-grab fruit or nuts available, such as pears, peaches, pecans, etc. this way you can get nourished easily and in no time. At work you will have to take a stand, figuratively and literally. You need to let your team know that rest is an important part of your health and that you will reduce your work schedule to 8 hrs. a day. and then you should set up breaks during the day, at least 2 per day, to get up from your chair and walk around for a while. It would be ideal if you can go outdoors and take some sun and fresh air, for at least 5 min. This will let your body rest from your uncomfortable chair, but also release stress, clear your mind and provide some mild exercise. I hope that with these small changes in your routine you will be able to start recovering your health and wellbeing very soon, I'm sure you will succeed!", "task_id": "1e1666cf-3408-4a45-98ef-823784c658f4", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

This report outlines the observed problems and provides recommendations for improvement.\nAs it follows, the main observations are concerning  the approaching angle of the  Cessna 123 as it  approached the runway at a steeper angle than recommended, resulting in a hard touchdown. \nAs to the  flare timing, the pilot initiated the flare too late, causing the aircraft to touch down abruptly and finally, as far as the crosswind handling is concerned, Cessna 123 struggled to maintain alignment with the runway during crosswind conditions.\nSome Recommendations:\nAs to timing, we suggest that the pilot should undergo additional training on proper approach and flare techniques.\nConcerning crosswind training we suggest that the specific crosswind landing training is essential to improve handling during adverse conditions. \nIn respect to the review SOPs, we suggest that it is ensured adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs) for safe landings.\n\nIn conclusion, addressing these issues will enhance safety and prevent similar incidents in the future.

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is a complex machine composed of several essential components, each playing a crucial role in ensuring its functionality and ability to fly. At the core is the fuselage, the main body of the aircraft, which houses the cockpit, passenger cabin, and cargo space. The cockpit contains the controls and navigation systems, enabling pilots to operate the airplane. The fuselage's structure is designed to withstand pressure differences during flight, ensuring passenger safety and comfort.\nThe wings are perhaps the most critical elements for flight. Their aerodynamic shape creates lift by generating lower pressure on the upper surface and higher pressure underneath. Flaps and ailerons on the wings further enhance control during takeoff, landing, and turns.\nThe tail assembly, also known as the empennage, provides stability. It includes the vertical stabilizer, which prevents side-to-side motion, and the horizontal stabilizer, which manages pitch control.\nFinally, engines, whether jet or propeller-based, generate the thrust necessary for forward motion. Together, these parts harmonize to enable safe and efficient air travel.\n", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

While it was unclear whether Medina took any valuable items, the family was clearly disturbed by the intrusion.\n\nDefendant: Medina claimed that he mistakenly thought the house was empty. Fearing for his safety, he sought shelter in the house and ended up ransacking it, believing it to be unoccupied.\n\nVerdict: Medina was found guilty of trespassing, which is a criminal offense. The court imposed a fine of $1,000, to be paid in two installments—one immediately and the other at a later date. Additionally, Medina was sentenced to 300 hours of community service as part of his punishment.\n\nCommentary: The verdict appears appropriate given the circumstances. While Medina did not intend to cause harm, his actions of breaking and entering and disturbing the household could not be overlooked. The fine and community service serve as reasonable consequences for his unlawful actions, balancing the need for accountability with his claimed lack of intent.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 11.0 [SEP] Prompt: Now prepare the content for an informative web page about counterfeit goods. Be sure to keep the following points in mind: Types of counterfeit goods, the effect of counterfeiting on society, the signs of a fake, what to do if you discover fake goods.  Write 250-300 words. [SEP] Response: Understanding Counterfeit Goods: Types, Effects, and How to Spot Them\n\nCounterfeit goods are fake products made to look like genuine items. They come in many forms, including counterfeit clothing, accessories, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and even documents. These fake goods are often sold at lower prices, tempting unsuspecting consumers, but they pose serious risks beyond just financial loss.\n\nTypes of Counterfeit Goods\nCounterfeiting affects a wide range of products. Fashion items like designer clothes, handbags, and watches are commonly counterfeited. Electronics such as smartphones and chargers can be dangerous when made with inferior parts. Pharmaceuticals are especially concerning because fake medicines may lack the proper ingredients, putting lives at risk. Even official documents like passports and driver’s licenses can be forged, causing security concerns.\n\nEffects of Counterfeiting on Society\nThe impact of counterfeit goods goes far beyond tricking buyers. Economically, counterfeiting leads to billions of dollars in lost revenue for legitimate businesses and governments through unpaid taxes. It also contributes to job losses and stifles innovation. On a societal level, counterfeit products can threaten consumer safety, damage brand reputations, and fund organized crime networks.\n\nHow to Spot a Fake\nSpotting counterfeit goods requires careful attention. Look for poor-quality materials, uneven stitching, misspelled logos, or packaging errors. Genuine products often have security features such as holograms, watermarks, or serial numbers. If something feels off—whether it’s the weight, texture, or design—trust your instincts.\n\nWhat to Do if You Discover Fake Goods\nIf you suspect a product is counterfeit, avoid purchasing or using it. Report your findings to local authorities or consumer protection agencies. If it’s an official document, notify relevant government offices. By staying vigilant and informed, you help protect yourself and the wider community from the harms of counterfeit goods.\n", "task_id": "788dc6fa-5111-4a7c-b2c1-a9ddebd0b1a2", "ef_level": 11.0, "label": 5}

The operating costs for extracting bitumen are estimated between \\$6 and \\$14 per barrel, while producing synthetic crude costs between \\$18 and \\$22 per barrel. Supply costs are higher—ranging from \\$14 to \\$24 for bitumen and \\$36 to \\$40 for synthetic crude. Despite these costs, production is projected to increase significantly, with total oil supply expected to reach 3.9 million barrels per day by 2015.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe data suggests that while traditional markets will likely expand, the volume of production will require further market growth or the development of new markets to remain economically viable.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n* Continue monitoring global crude oil prices to ensure profitability.\n* Acquire more detailed data on resource distribution and cost factors.\n* Evaluate the cost and logistics of transporting skilled labor to remote locations.\n* Begin early testing in selected areas to validate extraction strategies.\n", "task_id": "b99c403f-3a8e-4397-a157-2644d1952584", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

Using an advanced computer simulation, researchers modeled various environmental changes associated with dam construction and assessed their effects on sloth livelihood. The simulation, run under multiple conditions, identified two primary threats: habitat loss and a significant reduction in food variety. These factors are projected to directly contribute to a sharp decline in sloth population. Based on the findings, the report concludes that the dam’s construction poses a serious risk to the species' survival in the region. To mitigate this threat, the study recommends relocating the affected sloths to the nearby Corona Valley before construction begins, as a proactive conservation measure to avoid ecological disaster and potential extinction.", "task_id": "76bba4e9-a91a-49e2-89a6-129b5a013873", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Robots are becoming increasingly common in various industries across my country, revolutionizing the way tasks are performed. In manufacturing, robots assemble products with precision and efficiency, reducing costs and increasing production speed. In healthcare, robotic-assisted surgeries allow for greater accuracy, while robotic exoskeletons help patients regain mobility. Service robots are also used in restaurants, hotels, and even customer service roles. While I find this technological advancement fascinating, I also have mixed feelings about the rapid integration of robots. On the positive side, robots improve productivity, enhance safety by handling dangerous tasks, and provide assistance in areas like elderly care. However, there are concerns about job displacement, as automation may replace human workers in certain industries. Additionally, over-reliance on robots could lead to a loss of critical skills and reduced human interaction. Society must find a balance embracing robotics for their benefits while ensuring that people are not left behind.

There weren’t parties like we know today, but cakes were prepared and offers were made. Then, the habits of wishing happy birthday, giving gifts and lighting candles became popular as a way to protect the birthday person from devils and ensure good things to the next year in the person’s life. The celebrations only became popular like we know today after fourteen centuries, in a collective festival performed in Germany\n\nDepartment Stores\nThe first department store was created in Paris, in 1850. It was conceived as a big place with a lot of options in products and brands. They wouldn’t sell just a specific product: there you could  find clothes, shoes, jewels, make up and many others things. That concept remained until today. So, if you want to buy many things with good prices, you can choose from one of the thousands in the world.\n\nEvery year, on the day after Thanksgiving, most of this stores have a big sale called Black Friday. On this day, it is possible to buy products with big discounts and you also have the option to buy things online. In 2016, more than 154 million people spent USD 3,3 billion dollars shopping only on the internet.", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 0}

A true friend is someone who supports you, listens to you, and shares both happy and difficult moments with you. Without friends, life can feel lonely and less meaningful.\n\nFriendship teaches us empathy, patience, and trust. When we are with friends, we learn how to cooperate, communicate, and care for others. Good friends help us become better people. They encourage us to reach our goals and stand by us when we fail.\n\nIn today’s fast-paced world, it is easy to lose touch with friends. That is why it is important to make time for them and keep the connection strong. Whether through a simple message, a call, or spending time together, maintaining friendships requires effort.\n\nIn conclusion, friends are not just people we enjoy spending time with—they are essential to our emotional well-being. A life with strong friendships is a life full of love, laughter, and support. ", "task_id": "7c464165-c356-4f07-a4db-d5a4802a7f3c", "ef_level": 7.0, "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: Nova Espécie de Ave Descoberta – Um Parente Próximo do Pisco-de-Peito-Ruivo-Americano\n\nTestes de DNA recentes revelaram uma nova espécie de ave que anteriormente se acreditava ser o pisco-de-peito-ruivo-americano (Turdus migratorius). Embora geneticamente relacionada, essa nova espécie identificada apresenta diferenças importantes tanto na aparência quanto no habitat.\n\nFisicamente, ela é um pouco menor que o pisco-de-peito-ruivo-americano e possui um bico visivelmente maior. A plumagem do macho tem um tom mais enferrujado, com menos vermelho no peito do que o habitual nessa outra espécie. Essas características sutis, mas consistentes, ajudam a diferenciá-la em campo.\n\nEmbora habite ambientes semelhantes, a nova espécie apresenta um comportamento diferente durante o inverno. Ao contrário do pisco-de-peito-ruivo-americano, que migra para o sul do Canadá, essa ave permanece no país durante todo o ano — uma diferença ecológica importante.\n\nUsando o sistema formal de classificação zoológica, a nova espécie é classificada da seguinte forma:\n\nReino: Animalia\n\nFilo: Chordata\n\nClasse: Aves\n\nOrdem: Passeriformes\n\nFamília: Turdidae\n\nGênero: Turdus\n\nEspécie: Turdus canadensis\n\n\nO nome sugerido, Turdus canadensis, destaca a forte associação da espécie com o Canadá, especialmente seu comportamento não migratório.

[SEP] Response: An airplane is made up of several key parts, each serving a specific function to ensure flight. The fuselage is the main body of the aircraft, housing passengers, cargo, and the cockpit. It provides the structure that holds everything together. The wings are essential for generating lift. They are designed to create a difference in air pressure above and below them, allowing the plane to stay airborne. The tail of the airplane, consisting of the horizontal stabilizer and vertical fin, helps with stability and control. The horizontal stabilizer keeps the plane level, while the vertical fin controls the aircraft’s direction by preventing yaw (side-to-side movement). Finally, the engine provides the thrust necessary to propel the airplane forward. Most modern planes use jet engines, which expel high-speed exhaust gases to generate forward motion.

I wanted to share an incident that occurred during my recent flight with the Cessna 123. It was quite a learning experience, and I thought it might be useful for you too.\n\nDuring the landing phase, I encountered several issues:\n\nI approached the runway faster than recommended, which caused the aircraft to float and consume more runway than expected. This made the landing quite challenging.\n\nDespite these issues, I managed to land safely, but it was a stark reminder of the importance of adhering to proper landing procedures. Continuous practice and awareness are crucial to avoid such situations.\n\nLet's catch up soon and discuss this in more detail.

A true friend is someone who supports you, listens to you, and shares both happy and difficult moments with you. Without friends, life can feel lonely and less meaningful.\n\nFriendship teaches us empathy, patience, and trust. When we are with friends, we learn how to cooperate, communicate, and care for others. Good friends help us become better people. They encourage us to reach our goals and stand by us when we fail.\n\nIn today’s fast-paced world, it is easy to lose touch with friends. That is why it is important to make time for them and keep the connection strong. Whether through a simple message, a call, or spending time together, maintaining friendships requires effort.\n\nIn conclusion, friends are not just people we enjoy spending time with—they are essential to our emotional well-being. A life with strong friendships is a life full of love, laughter, and support. ", "task_id": "6bd37619-8520-4e9f-b5e8-4d1b218f8a0d", "ef_level": 11.0, "label": 0}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 8.0 [SEP] Prompt: Explain in one sentence the factors which affect the premium of a liability policy. Write the sentence below. Use the text to help you. This is a non-graded activity. [SEP] Response: In the United States, there are seven basic types of home insurance. However, most homes are covered by two types, called Homeowner's 2 (HO-2) and Homeowner's 3 (HO-3). HO-2 covers the residence and personal property against 17 different types of peril, including fire, smoke, windstorm, theft, falling objects, electrical surges and water damage caused by home appliances. HO-3 covers all of the perils in HO-2 and adds all other perils not stated in the policy, excluding flood, earthquake, war and nuclear accident.\n\nThe owner must first determine how much it would cost to replace the house and many of the items inside. Most homeowner policies contain replacement cost coverage on the home and actual cash value coverage on personal property. Many policies also have automatic annual adjustments for inflation. This increases the amount of coverage on the home to keep pace with rising building costs.\n\nLiability coverage is an important part of any home insurance policy. It covers financial liability in case someone unrelated to the insured suffers a serious injury on the property. The general level of liability protection in the United States is $100,000, but many people have coverage of $300,000 or even more. Most policies set limits for items like jewelry, collectibles, and computers. If you own expensive items, you can pay extra premiums to have those items fully insured under what is called a floater.\n\nMany factors go into determining the premiums for a homeowner's policy. The age of the home, the materials used to build it, where it's located, the square footage and the number of rooms all play a role. Homeowners can usually save money on insurance policies by raising their deductible. In general, the higher the deductible, the lower the premiums.

In factories, robotic arms are streamlining production lines, improving efficiency and reducing human error. In hospitals, robots assist in surgeries, deliver medicines, and even help with patient care. Agricultural robots are being introduced to automate tasks like sowing, weeding, and harvesting, which is especially helpful in rural areas facing labor shortages. I feel optimistic about the growing use of robots, as they have the potential to improve productivity and safety. However, I also recognize the challenges they bring. On the positive side, robots can take over dangerous or repetitive tasks, reduce costs, and increase precision. On the negative side, they may lead to job displacement, especially for low-skilled workers, and widen the gap between those with access to technology and those without. Overall, while robots offer many benefits, it is important to implement them thoughtfully, ensuring that society adapts through education, upskilling, and inclusive policies.\n\nWould you like help tailoring this paragraph to a specific country or industry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Mexican fruits and vegetables, for instance, have become a common sight in US markets, benefiting both consumers and producers.\n\nWhile NAFTA has brought numerous benefits to all three member states, it has also created challenges.

[SEP] Response: The concept of celebrity often highlights the superficial aspects of fame, overshadowing genuine talent and hard work. Many celebrities are celebrated more for their social media presence and personal lives than for their actual contributions to their fields. This can create unrealistic standards and values, especially for young people who look up to them. The constant media attention and the pressure to maintain a certain image can lead to a lack of authenticity, with celebrities often presenting a curated version of their lives. Additionally, the immense wealth and privilege that come with celebrity status can create a disconnect from the everyday struggles of ordinary people. This disparity can foster a sense of entitlement and detachment, making it difficult for celebrities to relate to their fans. While there are certainly celebrities who use their platform for positive change, the overall culture of celebrity can sometimes promote vanity and materialism over substance and integrity.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write a criticism of a celebrity. It can be a particular celebrity or the whole idea of celebrity in general. Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The obsession with celebrity culture has become a troubling reflection of society's misplaced priorities. Celebrities, often celebrated for their superficial attributes rather than their talents or contributions, are elevated to an almost god-like status. Take, for example, social media influencers who, despite offering little of substance, are adored and imitated by millions. Their platforms are used to promote products, lifestyles, and ideals that are unattainable for most people, perpetuating unrealistic beauty standards and materialism. Furthermore, the constant glorification of these figures often overshadows more pressing issues, such as the struggles faced by everyday people or the real-life heroes working behind the scenes to make a difference. While some celebrities do use their platforms for good, the majority are more focused on self-promotion and maintaining their image. This culture of worshiping individuals for their fame rather than their actions or integrity sends a harmful message, prioritizing shallow aspirations over meaningful achievements. In the end, it reflects a society more interested in entertainment and distraction than in real, tangible progress\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 11.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write a paragraph about how media has changed in your lifetime. What media was important before? What do you use now, and how has it changed your reading habits? Pay attention to your use of commas, colons and semicolons. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: The media landscape has undergone dramatic changes over the past few decades, shaped by technological advancements, shifting consumer habits, and societal transformations. From the dominance of print newspapers to the rise of digital platforms, these changes have revolutionized how we create, consume, and interact with information.\n\n1. Traditional to Digital\nIn the past, media was primarily distributed through newspapers, magazines, radio, and television. These formats followed a one-way communication model where media organizations produced content, and audiences consumed it passively. The internet disrupted this model, introducing digital media platforms that allow for instantaneous, global communication. Online publications, blogs, and social media have replaced much of the print industry, offering faster access to information and diverse perspectives.\n\n2. The Rise of Social Media\nSocial media has transformed how we interact with media, making it more personal, participatory, and immediate. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter (now X), Instagram, and TikTok enable users to become content creators, bypassing traditional gatekeepers. This shift has democratized information but also introduced challenges, such as misinformation and the erosion of trust in reliable sources.\n\n3. 24/7 News Cycle\nThe advent of cable news and later online news platforms introduced the 24/7 news cycle, drastically increasing the speed of reporting. While this provides timely updates, it also pressures media outlets to prioritize speed over depth, sometimes leading to inaccuracies or sensationalism.", "task_id": "7e0827d0-955c-484a-8c4f-81fe6a574af8", "ef_level": 11.0, "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response:  \nHi Josh and Ken,\n \nI've been reflecting on our discussions about the rent increase and our options moving forward. I’d like to propose a third option that might offer a balance between staying downtown and moving to a lower-cost area.\n \nWhat if we set up a smaller satellite showroom in a shared space in Centerville's upcoming business hub? This area is gaining popularity with young professionals, and shared retail spaces there are significantly cheaper than our current rent. We could maintain a small presence downtown for fittings and high-end consultations, while the bulk of our production and services transition to this hub.\n \nWe could also use the savings to enhance our digital presence, creating virtual fitting options and an online experience that mirrors in-store service. This hybrid model would let us stay connected with our loyal customers downtown while reaching a new audience and controlling costs.\n \nI’d love to hear your thoughts.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 8.0 [SEP] Prompt: Summarize the siege incident in no more than 50 words. Use the text to help you. Compare your text with the model. This is a non-graded activity. [SEP] Response: Careers are available for men and women irrespective of race, ethnic origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation or social background. (N.B. The RAF Regiment, which is a specialist fighting force, is not open to women, for reasons of combat effectiveness.)\n\nCareers are available for school leavers with minimal qualifications and also for young people who have specialist skills or university degrees. It is unlikely that young people without qualifications will be promoted to the highest ranks. However, it is possible if they gain qualifications during their RAF career. They are encouraged to do so.\n\nSchool leavers can apply at age 16 and learn a trade through on-the-job training.\n\nStudents who have stayed on at school and achieved pass marks or higher in national exams have an increased number of career options available. School leavers will join as aircraftmen or women and during their careers may be promoted to the highest non-commissioned ranks and, in some cases, become commissioned officers.\n\nUniversity graduates enter as officers. Sponsorships are available for students in the last two years at school and/or in university.\n\nThere are over 50 different careers in the RAF. Ask the young person about  interests and skills before giving advice about specific careers. Use the materials you have been given, which will help you match the young person with suitable jobs.\n\nMany applicants are interested in jobs that will put them on board aircraft. Explain that this is more likely if the young person is a graduate or has specific qualifications. However, school leavers who join as non-commissioned aircrew (NCA) will train as weapon systems operators and will work on board fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters and may specialize in acoustics, electronic warfare or linguistics. The training for these jobs is up to three years. On completing training, there is automatic promotion to sergeant.\n\nYoung people wishing to become pilots can apply on leaving school at 17.5 years old or older. They must have good results in national examinations. They should be encouraged to apply for sponsorship and given advice about subjects to study at school and university. Explain that the young person will be tested in order to establish their aptitude for a career as a pilot. Also explain that once they have completed their elementary flying training, they will be streamed to fly fast jets, multi-engine aircraft or helicopters according to their capabilities. Not all pilots are fighter pilots. Many pilots spend their careers ferrying troops or supplies.\n\nThere is a shortage of air traffic controllers. Encourage school leavers to consider this job. They must have a minimum of five good results in the national exams taken at age 16. These must include English and maths. They will have to take aptitude tests and will join as non-commissioned aircrew. ", "task_id": "dfc6e64d-9c86-4def-8474-17be136ac1a5", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 0}

The Internet has emerged and established itself as the new backbone of global networks. Since the mid-1980s, most large mergers and acquisitions have resulted in lower returns on equity over the next three years compared to the industry average. Successful mergers depend on creating new business designs that can capture the future value growth of the industry, rather than simply expanding the company's current operations.

It was like I was living in a ruin, which was far from being the truth.\nIn the meantime, I found out about a contest. There were 15 prizes of 500 euro each, winable during this entire year. Being sure I am not going to win anything, I still tried out my luck. This was on April 13, around 4 a.m. I won. A few days later, I received the money.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a trilateral trade pact between the United States, Canada, and Mexico that came into effect on January 1, 1994. Its primary goal was to eliminate barriers to trade and investment among the three countries, creating one of the world's largest free-trade zones.\n\nNAFTA reduced or removed tariffs on a wide range of goods and services, from agricultural products to automobiles, promoting economic integration. It also introduced measures to protect intellectual property, establish dispute-resolution mechanisms, and set labor and environmental standards.\n\nThe agreement significantly boosted trade among the three nations, increasing cross-border economic activity and fostering cooperation. However, it also faced criticism. While proponents highlighted the economic benefits, such as lower consumer prices and job creation in certain sectors, critics pointed to the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs, particularly from the U.S. to Mexico, and concerns over environmental degradation.\n\nNAFTA remained in effect until July 1, 2020, when it was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which updated and modernized several provisions to address 21st-century trade challenges.\n\nDespite its controversies, NAFTA played a pivotal role in shaping North American trade relations and global economic dynamics for over two decades.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a significant trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It came into effect in January 1994 after several years of negotiation. The primary goal of NAFTA was to reduce or eliminate customs duties and other trade barriers among the three countries, making it easier and more cost-effective to import and export goods across borders.\n\nNAFTA has had a major impact on trade relationships in North America, particularly in the agricultural sector. For instance, it allowed for an increased flow of Mexican fruits and vegetables into the United States, giving American consumers access to a wider range of products at competitive prices.\n\nWhile the agreement has brought economic benefits, such as increased trade volumes and stronger economic ties, it has also faced criticism. Some industries and workers have experienced negative effects, including job losses due to companies relocating production to lower-cost regions.\n\nDespite these challenges, NAFTA is generally seen as beneficial for all three member countries.

I'm thrilled to have you join our dynamic team, and I'm excited to give you a glimpse into what makes our company an industry leader.\n\nLet's start with a little story. Many years ago, I had an unexpected run-in with the ocean—literally. I was bitten by a shark and found myself adrift until a passing ship saved my life. That experience sparked a realization: a ship can be a lifeline, a critical connector in the vast expanse of the world. Inspired by that moment, I founded Frisko Shipping in 2001 with a vision to connect people and businesses globally.\n\nFast forward to today, and Frisko Shipping has grown beyond my wildest dreams. We now have a presence in 20 cities across the globe, supported by a dedicated team of over 5,000 employees. Last year, we achieved a profit of 5 million dollars, capturing 10 percent of the global market. These figures are not just numbers; they represent the tireless effort and commitment of our incredible team.\n\nNow, as new members of Frisko Shipping, we expect you to bring motivation and enthusiasm to the table. Your fresh perspectives and energy are vital to our continued success and innovation.\n\nTo make this introduction a bit more engaging, I thought we might hold a quiz to see how much you already know about the company. So, get ready to test your knowledge and maybe learn a few fun facts along the way.\n\nAs you start your journey with us, remember that inspiration can come from the most unexpected places—just like it did for me. I hope my story encourages you to stay open to the possibilities around you and to find your own sources of inspiration.\n\nI’d like to conclude by challenging you to think and act boldly. Consider what impact you can make here at Frisko Shipping and in the world at large. Your ideas and initiatives are what will propel us forward.\n\nThank you for choosing to be part of our team. Together, let's set sail toward new horizons!\n\nBest regards,\n\nBill Frisko\n\n", "task_id": "5c89b5ef-f9e4-44c0-bd77-31ed1d856ff0", "ef_level": 11.0, "label": 5}

Isn’t that very dangerous?\n\nCaptain: Well, large vessels cause less damage to property near the shore if the ship is out at sea. If a vessel breaks free from their berthing at the dock, they can do a lot of damage. The Sea Fair is 400 meters long, and made of steel, you know!\n\nInterviewer: But aren’t we expecting 100 mile an hour winds and over 40 foot sea surges?\n\nCaptain: Hmm. Staff at company headquarters in Berlin are consulting the hurricane maps to keep up-to-date with changing conditions.\n\nInterviewer: So if you’re in port, how will you stay safe?\n\nCaptain: Well, we’ll have to ballast down the vessel. This can help to reduce the effect of the high winds.\n\nInterviewer: What does that mean, ballast down? Weigh her down with something?\n\nCaptain: Yes. We’ll put water in the ballast tank. Secure the vessel with lines to fixed points on shore. And we’ll also make sure the crew can escape – emergency lifeboats have to be operational at all times. And we’d take a roll-call of everyone.\n\nInterviewer: What will you do about the cargo on board?\n\nCaptain: We’ll lash the cargo securely. The vessel owners want to know their goods will reach their port of destination safely. Of course, if we’re at sea in the middle of the storm, we’ll also have to secure the cargo. When there’s a lot of rolling due to high winds, the cargo on board can change position, and cause the ship to list, or lean, to one side.\n\n**Interviewer:**Do you talk to the US Coast Guard about a decision like this?\n\nCaptain: Absolutely. I’m waiting for a call from them now.\n\nInterviewer: And what do you think the Sea Fair should do – stay in port, or ride out the storm?\n\nCaptain: Well, I think the Sea Fair can manage the hurricane at sea.\n\nInterviewer: Well, we all wish you, your crew, and cargo safe passage, Captain.", "task_id": "ab1a0aca-54f8-4ac8-8e20-3c9260b060c9", "ef_level": 11.0, "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: Hello Harry,\n\nHope you are doing well.\n\nAs discussed earlier with you I'm sharing some ideas for motivating your employees which could help you to create an environment where your team feels motivated, engaged, and ready to perform at their best.\n\n1) Incentivize your employees: Make them feel that the company's success means success for them as well. There's nothing like a possible reward to motivate people.\n\n2) Micromanaging: Avoid excessive control over how tasks are done, which can lead to frustration and decreased motivation.\n\n3) Emphasize a healthy work-life balance.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The EU-Mercosur agreement was signed a month ago. It is a complex trade pact between the European Union (of which Italy, my country, is a member) and some Latin American countries: Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. The negotiations began in 1990s and the result of which is a reduction in trade barriers that could favor the mutual export of products, creating the largest free trade area on the planet.\nHowever, there is a bitter controversy about this agreement: it is based on speculative dynamics that perpetuate the imbalances between the North and the South of the world, relaunches an extractive agro-industrial model that has made food production one of the primary causes of climate-altering emissions, devastation of biodiversity, intensive breeding of tens of billions of animals in the world, reckless exploitation of natural resources, primarily soil and fresh water. Furthermore, this new pact generates violence against Latin American indigenous communities who are pushed out of their territories, poisoned with toxic agrochemicals, whose forests are deforested. All this mentioned before dismantles the possibility of a concrete transition towards agroecological practices and food sovereignty.\nDoubts and resistance are also being raised in Europe, where farmers themselves believe they are being penalized by an agreement that puts them under even more pressure: favoring unfair competition from imported productions made at significantly lower costs and according to lower or non-existent standards (relative to the use of pesticides, antibiotics, hormones, working conditions, animal welfare, ...), fueling environmental and health concerns. \nCitizens - and farmers – yearn for an honest food production, based on respect for the earth and all living things.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 8.0 [SEP] Prompt: You are a medical resident who writes a blog about the health industry. One of your readers has asked you a question. Read the question, then write a suitable answer. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: \n\nThe medical industry is the biggest industry in the U.S., and is also one of the fastest growing industries. It combines medical technology with the human touch, and provides jobs for about 13 million Americans. The demand for healthcare is growing in many areas, such as emergency treatment, therapy or long-term care.\n\nThe health services industry is always changing, and technological advances have made many new procedures and methods of diagnosis and treatment possible. Clinical developments like organ transplants, less invasive surgical techniques, skin grafts, and gene therapy for cancer treatment continue to increase the longevity and improve the quality of life for many people. Medical advances have also improved the survival rates of trauma victims and the severely ill, increasing the need for therapists and support personnel. Our expanding medical knowledge has also created an enormous number of medical specialties to choose from, such as cardiology, ophthalmology, or oncology.\n\nA career in medicine has benefits as well as shortcomings. On the one hand, jobs are generally well-paid and demand is high for skilled, qualified people.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in my country can be both exciting and stressful. The process is not overly complicated, but it does involve a fair amount of paperwork and patience. First, most people get pre-approved for a mortgage by a bank or lender. This requires providing proof of income, bank statements, credit history, and other financial details. Interest rates can vary, but they typically range between 3% and 5%, depending on the market, the loan type, and the borrower’s credit score.\n\nHousing prices have risen significantly in recent years, especially in major cities. In some areas, it’s very difficult for first-time buyers to afford a home without financial help from family or government programs. A 20% down payment is often expected, although some lenders allow smaller deposits with additional conditions.\n\nWhile it’s not legally required to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker, many buyers choose to do so to make the process easier. Agents help find suitable properties and negotiate prices, while mortgage brokers compare loan options from different lenders.\n\nOverall, buying a home here takes time and careful planning. There are quite a few forms to fill out, but with the right support and preparation, it’s definitely manageable. The key is to research, stay organized, and not rush the process.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find focused free writing and listing especially useful. Focused free writing allows ideas to flow naturally, but with a clear direction. It encourages creativity without overwhelming the writer with the need for perfection, while still staying on-topic. This method helps generate meaningful content quickly and often brings out deeper thoughts that may have been overlooked.\nListing, on the other hand, is great for organizing thoughts in a concise way. It simplifies complex topics into manageable pieces and often serves as a starting point for longer writing. By jotting down ideas, details, or even contrasting viewpoints, listing helps clarify structure and argument.\nSymbolism and metaphor are also powerful, particularly when trying to create emotional resonance or vivid imagery. They add layers of meaning that can elevate basic writing to something more thought-provoking. Each technique serves a distinct purpose, but the combination of spontaneity (from free writing), structure (from listing), and creativity (from metaphor and symbolism) seems to offer the most balanced and effective toolkit for a writer aiming to express ideas clearly and memorably.\n", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: Hang Seng Index Shows Strong Recovery and Promising Outlook\n\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI) has shown impressive growth over the past six months, rebounding from a low of 20,956 to a recent high of 27,499. This steady climb is largely attributed to increased investment from Mainland China, which has boosted confidence in the Hong Kong market.\n\nTwo of the biggest winners have been the Properties and Utilities sub-indices, both of which have seen dramatic gains. These sectors have benefited directly from China’s economic momentum and growing demand for real estate and infrastructure development.\n\nMarket analysts remain optimistic, forecasting that the HSI will continue to rise into next year. This positive outlook is supported not only by sustained investment from China, but also by growing interest from international investors and stronger domestic demand within Hong Kong itself.\n\nIf the trend continues, the HSI could be poised for one of its strongest performances in recent years, positioning Hong Kong as a key financial hub in Asia once again.

Have a look at your checklist, then write him an email advising him of the changes he has to make. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Conducting a comprehensive property and liability insurance assessment for Dave’s Old Clothes Emporium reveals several critical areas of concern that need immediate attention to mitigate potential risks.\n\nStarting with the exterior, the presence of loose bricks poses a significant hazard. These can easily fall and injure customers or passersby, which could lead to costly liability claims. Blocked drainpipes also present a risk, as they can cause water damage or flooding, potentially impacting not only the structure but also the inventory within. Additionally, the untidy yard can create a negative impression for customers, detracting from the business’s appeal.\n\nInside the emporium, poor lighting can lead to accidents, as customers may not see hazards clearly. The absence of air conditioning is not just uncomfortable; it could pose health risks, particularly during hot weather. The stacked boxes and cluttered sidewalks further increase the risk of trips and falls, while old fire extinguishers and loose chemicals raise serious safety concerns, putting both employees and customers at risk in case of an emergency.\n\nTo ensure a safer environment and reduce liability exposure, it is essential for Dave's Old Clothes Emporium to address these issues promptly. Regular maintenance and adherence to safety regulations will not only enhance customer satisfaction but also protect the business from potential lawsuits and financial losses.

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, **focused free writing** and **questioning** stand out as particularly useful to me. Focused free writing allows for a flow of thoughts without the pressure of structure, which can be very helpful when brainstorming or working through writer’s block. I find that it often leads to unexpected ideas and connections that I might not have considered otherwise. By writing freely on a topic for a set amount of time, I can uncover deeper thoughts and insights that might otherwise remain hidden.\n\nOn the other hand, **questioning** is another technique that I often use, especially when I want to dive deeper into a subject or explore different angles of a topic. Asking questions helps to refine the direction of my writing and can lead to more focused, meaningful content. It’s also a great way to clarify ideas and challenge assumptions, which ultimately strengthens the overall writing.\n\nBoth techniques help me stay engaged in the writing process, fostering creativity and improving clarity.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 14.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write an email to a fellow pilot, telling him or her what happened. Write 70 - 100 words. [SEP] Response: Aviation is not only about flying; it also encompasses a wide range of activities to ensure that aircraft operate safely and efficiently. Two critical aspects of aviation are maintenance and safety, both of which are essential for preventing accidents and ensuring reliable air travel.\n\nMaintenance:\nAircraft maintenance involves regular inspections, repairs, and overhauls to keep aircraft in optimal condition. There are different levels of maintenance, ranging from routine checks (like pre-flight inspections) to more in-depth servicing (like engine overhauls). Aircraft mechanics and engineers are responsible for ensuring that every component of the plane, from the engines to the avionics, functions properly. Maintenance schedules are often regulated by aviation authorities like the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).\n\nSafety:\nSafety in aviation is paramount and is governed by strict regulations and international standards. The goal is to minimize the risk of accidents and incidents. This involves rigorous pilot training, strict air traffic control procedures, advanced safety technologies like collision avoidance systems, and stringent airport security protocols. Aircraft are designed with multiple redundancies, meaning that if one system fails, there are backups to ensure the plane can still operate safely. The aviation industry continuously analyzes data from past incidents to improve safety practices and implement new technologies aimed at enhancing overall safety.\n\nIn short, the combination of thorough maintenance procedures and a strong emphasis on safety helps aviation remain one of the safest modes of transportation in the world.

If possible, consider having an honest conversation with your manager about how recognition could improve morale.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The concept of celebrity often thrives on superficiality and spectacle, prioritizing fame over substance. While some celebrities use their platform responsibly, many become emblematic of a culture that rewards controversy and excess. This phenomenon perpetuates shallow ideals, as the public is inundated with curated images of perfection that rarely reflect realty.\n\nTake, for instance, the tendency of some celebrities to engage in performative activism - making grandiose statements or donations that, while flashy, often lack sustained commitment to real change. This behaviour not only diminishes the authenticity of important causes but also shifts focus away from grassroot efforts that are far more impactful.\n\nMoreover, the obsession with celebrity, culture can lead to misplaces priorities in society, where achievements in fields like science, education , and public service are overshadowed by trivial gossip about a star's personal life. The skewed valutaion perpetuates a culture of distraction, undermining societal progress.\n\nWhile individual celebrities cannot bear all the blame, the very structure of fame often incetivizes the worst aspects of human nature, from vanity to greed. It is high time we reevaluate our collective obsession with celebrity and channel attention towrads more meaningful endeavours.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Section: Psychological Operations (PsyOps)\nPsychological Operations were intended to play a major role in the exercise but proved to be a significant disappointment. Despite the resources and planning allocated, late decision-making regarding leaflet content severely disrupted the timeline. The last-minute choice to produce and airdrop messages in Arabic, English, and Farsi led to logistical confusion—aircraft were sent to incorrect locations and dropped the wrong materials. This resulted in complaints from exercise participants and, more seriously, diplomatic protests from the host nation and official observers.\n\nThe Civil Exercise Cell was poorly manned, largely inexperienced, and lacked effective leadership. There was limited coordination with the military PsyOps team, worsened by language barriers. Weak communication and poor-quality briefings led to widespread misunderstanding, missed deadlines, and confusion over orders.\n\nRecommendations include establishing a clearer command structure and improving pre-exercise briefings to ensure instructions are understood. All personnel should attend mandatory briefings. Language training and improved liaison between civilian and military PsyOps teams are essential.

[SEP] Response: Title: The Power of Mindfulness\n\nIn today’s fast-paced, always-connected world, it can often feel like there’s no time to slow down. With constant notifications, tight deadlines, and endless to-do lists, we find ourselves caught up in a whirlwind of activity. But what if there was a simple practice that could help you regain focus, reduce stress, and unlock your true potential\n\nEnter mindfulness — the practice of being fully present and aware in the moment. While it may sound like a modern-day trend, mindfulness has deep roots in ancient spiritual traditions, particularly Buddhism. However, in recent years, mindfulness has gone mainstream, and for good reason: it has the power to transform not only your mental health but also your overall quality of life.\n\nWhat is Mindfulness?\nAt its core, mindfulness is about paying attention to the present moment without judgment. It’s about tuning into your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings, rather than rushing through life or dwelling on the past or future. By bringing awareness to each experience, you allow yourself to experience life more fully.\n\nMindfulness can take many forms: from practicing meditation to simply being more present during everyday tasks like eating, walking, or talking with others. The beauty of mindfulness is that it doesn’t require fancy equipment or a lot of time; it’s something you can integrate into your life, wherever you are.\n\nWhy Mindfulness Matters\nIn a world filled with distractions, mindfulness offers a chance to break free from the noise and truly connect with what’s important. Here are just a few reasons why mindfulness is worth making a part of your daily routine:\n\nStress Reduction: Mindfulness has been shown to significantly reduce stress and anxiety. By focusing on the present, you can break free from the cycle of worrying about what’s next or ruminating on past mistakes. This allows your body and mind to relax and recharge.\n\nImproved Focus: With so many distractions, it’s easy to lose focus on what’s important. Mindfulness trains your brain to stay in the moment, which helps improve concentration, whether you’re at work, studying, or enjoying a hobby.\n\nBetter Relationships: When you practice mindfulness, you become more aware of your emotions and reactions. This heightened self-awareness can improve communication and empathy in your relationships, allowing you to listen more attentively and respond more thoughtfully.\n\nIncreased Emotional Intelligence: Mindfulness helps you become more in tune with your emotions, which can lead to better decision-making, greater resilience, and improved emotional regulation. By understanding your feelings, you can respond to challenges with a clearer mind and more balanced perspective.\n\nPhysical Health Benefits: Research has shown that mindfulness practices can lower blood pressure, reduce inflammation, and boost overall immune function. In addition to improving mental health, mindfulness has a direct impact on physical well-being.\n\nHow to Practice Mindfulness\nThe best part about mindfulness is that it’s simple to practice and doesn’t require any special training or tools. Here are some simple ways you can incorporate mindfulness into your daily life:\n\nMindful Breathing: One of the simplest mindfulness exercises is to focus on your breath. Find a quiet space, close your eyes, and take deep, slow breaths. Pay attention to the sensation of the air entering and leaving your body. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your focus back to your breath.\n\nBody Scan: Lie down or sit comfortably, and focus on each part of your body, from your toes to your head. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort without judgment. This practice helps you become more aware of how your body feels and can be incredibly grounding.\n\nMindful Eating: Instead of eating in front of the TV or while scrolling through your phone, try eating mindfully. Pay attention to the colors, textures, and flavors of your food. Take smaller bites and savor each one. This not only improves your mindfulness but also helps with digestion and portion control.\n\nMindful Walking: Whether you’re taking a short walk during lunch or strolling through nature, use the opportunity to practice mindfulness. Pay attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sounds around you, and the sigh\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "6bd37619-8520-4e9f-b5e8-4d1b218f8a0d", "ef_level": 11.0, "label": 0}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico that came into effect in January 1994 after years of negotiation. It aimed to reduce or eliminate customs duties among the three countries, facilitating the free movement of goods and services across borders.\n\nNAFTA had a profound impact on trade relations, particularly in industries such as agriculture. For example, Mexican fruits and vegetables gained easier access to the U.S. market, increasing trade volume and providing American consumers with more affordable produce. Similarly, American and Canadian companies benefited from expanded export opportunities in various sectors, such as manufacturing and automotive industries.\n\nDespite its advantages, NAFTA also had drawbacks. Some American and Canadian workers lost jobs due to increased competition from Mexican industries, where labor costs were lower. However, the agreement contributed to economic growth in all three nations. Overall, NAFTA played a crucial role in strengthening North American trade and economic integration.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: \nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a vital aspect of modern business that goes beyond mere compliance with legal requirements. It represents a commitment to ethical practices, sustainability, and a positive impact on society. In my opinion, CSR is essential for fostering trust and building a strong reputation among stakeholders, including customers, employees, and investors.\n\nCSR initiatives can lead to long-term benefits for companies by enhancing brand loyalty and differentiating them from competitors. Consumers are increasingly mindful of the social and environmental implications of their purchases, and companies that actively engage in CSR can appeal to this growing demographic. Moreover, CSR can improve employee morale and retention, as workers often prefer to be associated with organizations that align with their personal values.\n\nHowever, CSR should not be seen merely as a marketing tool or a box-ticking exercise. Authenticity is crucial; companies must genuinely integrate CSR into their business strategies and operations. Effective CSR requires transparency, accountability, and a willingness to address complex global challenges.\n\nUltimately, CSR is not just about philanthropy; it is about creating a sustainable business model that contributes to the greater good while ensuring long-term profitability. When done right, it reflects a company’s commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen and can lead to meaningful change in society.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

It helps me develop my thoughts freely while staying on topic, which is especially helpful during the early stage of writing. It feels like a brainstorming session that clears my mind and sharpens my focus.\nListing, on the other hand, is a simple yet powerful technique that helps me organize my thoughts quickly. When I'm overwhelmed with ideas, listing allows me to break them down into manageable points. It's especially helpful when planning an easy or project, as it gives a clear direction or development. I also find metaphor useful because it adds creativity and deeper meaning to my writing. By comparing one thing to another, metaphors help readers understand complex ideas in a more relatable way. Overall, these techniques  make writing easier, clearer, and more engaging.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 4}

Empathy is essential to creating a harmonious and motivating work environment. I have observed that the most effective leaders are those who know how to encourage and inspire their teams, while remaining accessible. In my experience, adaptability is also essential, because each situation may require a different approach. I believe that everyone has the potential to become a leader by developing certain skills, everyone can strengthen their leadership abilities. The leader must share his vision of things and encourage the team to move in the same direction and work together with respect to be more efficient. Self-confidence allows you to guide the team, but it must be accompanied by humility, in fact you must not be arrogant.

It hoolds the crew who operate the aircraft, the passengers who travel inside the cabin, and the cargo includes luggage. The cabin is where passengers sit, while the cockpit at the front, is where the pilots control the plane. The landing gear includes wheels or skids, supports the airplane during takeoff, landing, and move on the ground.\nThe wings generate lift, allowing the airplane to fly.

The fin keeps the plane steady and prevents side to side movement. The rudder attached to the fin, helps steer the aircraft left or right.\nThe engines provide the power needed for flight.

[SEP] Response: When it comes to writing, we all have our own styles and preferences. For me, techniques like free writing and loop writing work wonders. They allow me to just let my thoughts flow without worrying about structure. It’s like giving my brain the freedom to think without any rules, and that often sparks creativity when I feel stuck. On the other hand, I find that listing helps me organize my thoughts, especially when I’m trying to write something more structured. It’s a great way to get my ideas out in a clear, logical format. I also love the idea of questioning, where I put myself in the reader's shoes and think about what they’d want to know.

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: Hang Seng Index Shows Robust Growth, Driven by Mainland China Investment\n\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI), Hong Kong's key stock market benchmark, has displayed impressive growth over the past six months, largely fueled by substantial investments from Mainland China. After a drop to 20,956 points six months ago, the index has surged to a high of 27,499 points, reflecting a remarkable recovery and upward momentum.\nThis growth has been particularly strong in the Properties and Utilities sub-indices, sectors that have benefited from China’s economic expansion. As Mainland China continues to invest heavily in Hong Kong, these sectors have become major drivers of the index's performance.\nLooking ahead, experts are optimistic about the HSI's prospects. They predict that the index will continue to rise in the coming year, supported by both foreign investments and growing domestic demand within Hong Kong. As the global economy stabilizes and international investors turn their attention to the region, the Hang Seng Index is poised for further gains, making it an attractive option for those seeking exposure to the dynamic Asian markets. \nWith Mainland China’s influence and a favorable economic outlook, the future of the HSI looks promising.

A true leader listens actively, values team input, and leads by example, especially during cahllenging satuations. I believe leadership begins with taking initiative, being responsible, and making decisions that benefit the entire team, not just oneself.  Confidence is essential, but so is humility.  Leaders admit mistakes and use failures as opportunities to grow.  They also empower others by recognizing their strengths and encouraging them to take ownership.

For this usually one or even several real estate agents will be selected out of all agents coming into question. Then, if you have found something that is of interest for you, you have to try to get an appointment with the real estate agent to have a closer view to the object. If the house or flat finds your approval, you have to see for a concrete appointment with the the real estate agent. At this appointment all relevant documents must be at hand, including proof of identity, bank savings, possible bank loans proving a finance plan and any other documents the real estate agent may have asked for. In case you have to finance a part of the deal by a bank loan, of course this has to be initiated in beforehand. To get a bank loan, you also have to provide several documents as your identity, bank savings, pay slips and normally a credit report. Different banks have different conditions for bank loans. These have to be evaluated to find the best solution for your specific needs and financial possibilities. Provided you have all documents gathered together and the real estate agent gives you green light, you have to contact a notary to fix the deal, pay first rates and hopefully found a new, cosy home.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 4}

Be sure to polish your work before you submit it. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Paris then Kyoto: A Tale of Two Cities\nParis, the City of Light, mesmerizes visitors with its grandeur and artistic legacy. The Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and charming cafés line its bustling streets, offering an intoxicating mix of culture and history. The romance of Paris is found in its lively energy—whether walking along the Seine or savoring a croissant at a corner bakery, the city hums with an unmistakable elegance.\nThen Kyoto, a city steeped in tradition, whispers a different kind of beauty. Where Paris dazzles with its cosmopolitan charm, Kyoto captivates with its serene temples and cherry blossoms. Instead of towering monuments, Kyoto offers tranquil gardens, intricate tea ceremonies, and wooden machiya houses that speak to its timeless essence. The pace here is slower, the atmosphere reflective, and the spirit of the past lives harmoniously with the present.\nBoth cities offer unforgettable experiences, yet Paris thrives on vibrancy while Kyoto embraces tranquility. Whether one prefers the artistic fervor of Paris or the meditative grace of Kyoto, each city invites visitors to step into a world of wonder—distinct yet equally enchanting.", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in India can be both exciting and complex, depending on the buyer's financial situation and knowledge of the process. The overall process involves several stages, including finding a property, obtaining a loan, and completing legal formalities.\n\nThe application for a home loan usually requires filling out multiple forms, such as personal details, income verification, and property-related documents. Lenders may require a good credit score, stable income, and a down payment of 10-20% of the property's value. The paperwork can be overwhelming, especially for first-time buyers. Many lenders also ask for property appraisals and legal checks, adding to the documentation burden.\n\nHousing prices in India are expensive, particularly in urban areas like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore. The prices can vary significantly based on location, size, and amenities. However, in smaller cities, housing might be more affordable.\n\nInterest rates for home loans in India typically range from 7% to 9%, depending on the lender, the type of loan, and the applicant's profile. The rates may be fixed or floating.\n\nWhile it's not mandatory to hire a real estate agent or mortgage broker, it can be helpful. A real estate agent can help find properties that match your budget and requirements, while a mortgage broker can guide you through the home loan process, ensuring you get the best deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 4}

Have a look at your checklist, then write him an email advising him of the changes he has to make. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Risk Assessment and Recommendations for Your Secondhand Clothes Shop\n\nHi Dave,\nCongratulations on your new venture! I understand that you’re facing high insurance quotes for your secondhand clothes shop, especially since you’re renting an old building. After conducting a risk assessment, here are a few recommendations to help mitigate potential risks and possibly lower your insurance costs:\nRisk Assessment Checklist\n•\tBuilding Integrity: Ensure the structural integrity of the building by having it inspected by a professional. Address any repairs needed for the roof, walls, and foundation to prevent potential hazards.\n•\tFire Safety: Install smoke detectors, fire alarms, and fire extinguishers. Ensure that there are clear, accessible fire exits. Consider a sprinkler system if it’s within your budget.\n•\tElectrical System: Have a licensed electrician inspect the wiring and electrical systems to prevent fire risks. Replace any outdated or faulty wiring immediately.\n•\tSecurity Measures: Install security cameras, alarm systems, and secure locks on all entry points to deter theft and vandalism.\n•\tGeneral Maintenance: Regularly maintain heating, ventilation, and plumbing systems to avoid accidents and ensure a safe environment for customers and employees.\nImplementing these changes can significantly reduce the risk of property damage and liability claims. It’s also a good idea to discuss these upgrades with your insurance provider, as they may offer discounts for improved safety measures.\nBest of luck with your shop, and feel free to reach out if you need further advice.\nWarm regards,\nFrancesca", "task_id": "9e54df01-235a-418f-9836-724a7d2eda5e", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

This includes prioritizing tasks, practicing mindfulness, and developing a self-care routine. Engaging in physical activity, eating a healthy diet, and ensuring sufficient sleep are also crucial for long-term stress management.\n\nRelationship stress, a common experience, can negatively impact both partners and the relationship itself. It often stems from unaddressed conflicts, external stressors, or a lack of open communication, leading to withdrawal, arguments, and even physical health problems. Effective communication, mutual problem-solving, and seeking professional help when needed are crucial for managing relationship stress.", "task_id": "9032f3ed-5da1-4efe-b4dd-c9470bb35d65", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In the myriad of writing techniques introduced, I find metaphor and focused free writing particularly invaluable. Metaphors, by drawing vivid comparisons, provide a rich layer of meaning and enable readers to grasp complex ideas effortlessly. They bridge abstract concepts and concrete images, creating an evocative and memorable narrative. This technique transforms ordinary writing into a tapestry of vibrant imagery, making it appealing and thought-provoking.\n\nOn the other hand, focused free writing serves as a powerful tool for overcoming writer's block and honing in on specific ideas. By maintaining a central theme or topic while allowing thoughts to flow freely, this technique helps in developing a coherent structure without stifling creativity. It encourages exploration of a subject from multiple angles, often leading to unexpected insights and connections. This balance between freedom and focus makes it ideal for the initial stages of writing, providing a fertile ground for idea generation and refinement.

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, the ones I find most useful are FreeWriting, Focused FreeWriting, and Questioning. FreeWriting allows me to get past the initial hesitation or writer’s block by encouraging a continuous flow of thoughts without worrying about grammar or structure. This often leads to unexpected ideas that I can refine later. Focused FreeWriting builds on this by directing my thoughts toward a specific topic, helping me dig deeper while still maintaining a sense of freedom. I find this especially helpful when trying to understand my own perspective or develop a strong thesis.\n \nQuestioning is also valuable because it helps me explore different angles of a topic. By asking who, what, when, where, why, and how, I can uncover new insights and identify gaps in my understanding. This technique helps me shape more thoughtful and complete writing. While metaphors and symbolism are powerful for creative writing, I rely more heavily on the generative techniques like FreeWriting and Questioning during the drafting process. They help me build a solid foundation before adding more stylistic elements.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 8.0 [SEP] Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The fuselage is the body of the aircraft. The landing gear can be retracted into the undercarriage of the fuselage after take-off and must be in a GEAR DOWN position before landing. All passenger seats are located in the fuselage, as well as the cockpit and cargo storage locations. Attached to the fuselage are the wings. Due to the curved shape of the upper part of the wing it creates lift, but - by increasing the angle of attack and thus increasing lift - also more drag. For take-off and landing the pilot should use the flaps to decrease the stall speed. At the end of each wing you can find the ailerons. These parts are controlled by moving the stick in the cockpit left and right, causing the airplane to roll into the desired direction. Simultaneously using the rudder to support the directional change is key to a nice and clean turn. The rudder is part of the vertical stabilizer at the tail of the aircraft and controls the rate of turn. Another part of the tail is the horizontal stabilizer. This system is used to change the angle of attack and therefore the rate of climb and the altitude of the aircraft. Last but not least it depends on the type of aircraft which engine type is used. Generally, today there are two common types of engines used in aviation: Single engine piston engines, which commonly run on aviation gas (AVGAS), or turbines, which use jet-fuel or kerosene.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Metaphor is a powerful literary and rhetorical technique that involves describing one thing in terms of another, often unrelated, concept to create vivid imagery or convey complex ideas more clearly. By drawing comparisons, metaphors help readers or listeners understand abstract or unfamiliar concepts through more familiar or tangible experiences. For example, saying \"time is a thief\" suggests that time, like a thief, can take things away from us—such as moments or opportunities—without literally meaning it steals.\n\nThis technique is especially useful because it engages the imagination, making communication more memorable and impactful. Metaphors can simplify complicated ideas, evoke emotions, and add depth to writing or speech. In creative writing, they enrich storytelling by adding layers of meaning, while in persuasive writing or public speaking, they can make arguments more relatable and compelling. Metaphors also foster deeper emotional connections by allowing readers to see the world through a different lens, often revealing hidden similarities between seemingly unrelated ideas. This not only enhances creativity but also encourages critical thinking by challenging conventional perspectives. Overall, metaphor is a versatile and essential tool for enhancing clarity, emotional resonance, and artistic expression in language.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Criticizing the concept of celebrity culture, one can argue that it often promotes superficial values and unrealistic standards. Celebrities are frequently idolized for their appearance, wealth, and lifestyle rather than their character or contributions to society. This can lead to a culture where materialism and vanity are celebrated, overshadowing more meaningful achievements. Additionally, the constant media scrutiny and pressure to maintain a perfect image can have detrimental effects on celebrities' mental health, leading to issues such as anxiety and depression. While some celebrities use their platform for positive change, many others seem to prioritize personal gain over social responsibility. This imbalance can perpetuate a cycle of shallow aspirations among their followers. It's essential to recognize the influence of celebrity culture and strive for a more balanced perspective that values substance over style.

[SEP] Response: Initial Review of Oil and Gas in Carlos Field\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis report aims to give a basic overview of the oil and gas found in the new Carlos Field. We have some initial data, but it's not complete for all the resources.\n\nFindings\n\nWe drilled 47 test wells in the area and found signs of oil in rocks from different time periods. Most wells focused on one specific rock layer. Our research shows the field has the right conditions for oil and gas, but we haven't drilled enough to be sure. There is a chance of finding a lot of oil, but it's risky due to the limited number of wells.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe think Carlos Field might have about 21 million barrels of oil. With better technology, we could possibly find more. Remember, this is based on the limited data we have.\n\nRecommendations\n\nTo know more, we need to do a detailed study combining geology and engineering. This means gathering new data, using existing information, and making detailed maps of potential oil areas. We also need to understand the basic characteristics of the rocks and estimate the amount of oil they might hold.", "task_id": "d01ca0b4-5249-49a4-8daf-ac2e0f274357", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 4}

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find metaphor, focused free writing, and questioning to be the most useful for developing my ideas and enhancing my expression. Metaphor allows me to express abstract thoughts and emotions in creative and powerful ways by comparing them to more tangible or relatable things. This helps deepen meaning and create vivid images for the reader. Focused free writing is especially helpful when I have a topic in mind but don’t know where to begin. It helps me stay on track while still exploring new angles of the subject. It encourages flow without the pressure of perfection. Lastly, questioning helps me explore my topic in depth by challenging my assumptions and pushing me to consider different perspectives. Asking “why,” “how,” and “what if” opens up new directions in my writing and strengthens the quality of my arguments or narratives. These three techniques together make my writing more engaging, clear, and original.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Subject: Fascinating Article on Future Travel Trends\n\nHi Team,\n\nI came across an intriguing article about evolving trends in transportation and travel that I think you’ll find interesting. It discusses three major areas shaping the future of how we get around.\n\nFirst, it highlights a shift away from personal car ownership, especially among younger generations. Many are opting for public transport due to its sustainability, cost savings, and the ability to stay connected or productive during commutes.\n\nSecond, the article explores changes in air travel. Airlines continue to cut costs, which has led to the rise of budget carriers offering cheaper flights. While this means fewer luxuries, it makes flying more accessible to many travelers.\n\nLastly, it delves into the exciting prospect of space tourism.

As someone who loves writing and connecting with readers, having an outlet to share my thoughts while potentially helping others has been an incredible experience.\n\nWhen I first began blogging a few years ago, I really had no idea what I was doing. I would just sit down at my computer whenever inspiration struck and write whatever came to mind. Sometimes I would publish posts without even proofreading them because I was so eager to get my ideas out there.\n\nLooking back now, those early posts were pretty rough. It’s almost cringe-worthy to read some of my early writing. But we all have to start somewhere, right? Even though I made plenty of mistakes (which I’ll detail later in this post), blogging has enabled me to find my voice, create helpful content, and connect with readers from all walks of life.\n\nIf you’re thinking about starting a blog but feel intimidated or don’t know where to begin, I want this post to encourage you. You don’t have to have everything figured out on day one. I certainly didn’t! Consider this your kick in the pants to just take that first step and start writing.\n\nAnd to help you avoid some of the early pitfalls I encountered, I’ll take you through a step-by-step guide to learn how to write a great post, drawing from my own experience as well as expert insights from top bloggers.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Move over, werewolves and vampires. There’s a big, richly imaginative and extremely spooky world of desi ghosts, monsters and mythical creatures just waiting to devour…er to be discovered and given their rightful place in popular culture. Some of them can be found crawling through the pages of ancient texts, some adorn temple walls, while the stories of others are told through whispers and hushed songs, their forms changing and twisting with each narration. There are thousands of mythical creatures of Indian origin, but in the interest of space, attention span and potential Halloween costumes, we’ve prepared a list of seven fantastic creatures and where to find them (but hopefully you won’t go looking for them).\n\nTekhumiavi\nThe tale of the tekhumiavi or the were-tiger is popular among the Angami tribe of Nagaland. Unlike werewolves, were-tigers don’t transform from human to animal completely. Instead, only the soul of the human shifts to a tiger’s body, while the human body functions normally, albeit soulless for the time being. While in this form, the human behaves just like a tiger, and the human body experiences everything the tiger body does – somewhat like what happens in the Matrix. \n\nNow, how does one tell a tekhumiavi from a regular tiger? Simple – the were-tiger has five claws instead of four, so you can tell from the pugmarks. So, here’s something to look out for when you’re exploring the hills of Nagaland. \n\nTekhumiavi\nPenchapenchi\nThis monster out of Bengali folklore looks like an owl – yes, the dispenser of wisdom in animal stories – but it doesn’t exactly behave like one. A penchapenchi preys on forest dwellers, especially the ones who are foolish to wander off alone. Once the penchapenchi is sure that help is far away, it strikes down its prey and then drains their blood. Whether the victim turns into a penchapenchi (like in the case of a vampire bite) or not is yet to be confirmed.\n\nPenchapenchi\nNavagunjara\nA mash-up of nine different animals, the navagunjara makes a special appearance in an Odia retelling of the Mahabharata as a manifestation of Vishnu. Story goes that when Arjuna, one of the Pandava princes, was in the middle of a penance, a strange creature appeared before him. Arjuna’s instinctive reaction, because he was terrified, was of course to point an arrow at it. The creature had the neck and head of a peacock, the hump of a bull, the waist of a lion, and the tail of a snake, and it stood on three different kinds of feet – an elephant’s, a horse or a deer’s and a tiger’s. Its fourth limb was human, which held a lotus. Before he let the arrow fly, Arjuna saw the lotus and realised what the creature truly represented. \n\nNavagunjara\nNavagunjara\nNaale Ba\nAn urban legend, mostly based in Karnataka, demands that the words Naale ba or ‘come tomorrow’ be painted outside houses (with no spelling mistakes, mind) to ward off a witch, who likes knocking on doors at night and murdering whoever’s unlucky enough to open them. Thankfully, the witch’s kryptonite seems to be her own politeness.\n\nNaale Ba\nNishi\nMonsters really do have a thing for lone travellers, don’t they? The nishi, found mostly in the forests of Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand, are particularly vicious because they call out to their potential victims in the voice of their loved ones. Once the victims are lured into a well and truly secluded place, the nishi proceeds to kill them. Because they always appear in the distance, the only description we have of them is that they are shadowy creatures. Fortunately,  there is a way to identify these crafty creatures. If you hear the call thrice, you can rest assured that it’s not a nishi, because the ghost can, well, only be bothered to call out twice. The next time a loved one fondly calls out to you twice, there is no need to respond; flee.\n\nNishi\nGandeberunda\nYou probably already know the story of Narasimha, Vishnu’s hybrid avatar. Evil demon Hiranyakashipu gets a boon from Brahma that makes him practically invincible, which in turn gives him the licence to terrorize everyone. But when he tries to murder his own son, Vishnu decides that enough is enough and vanquishes Hiranyakashipu in the most creative way (you see, all boons come with loopholes) in his Narasimha avatar.\n\nThe story doesn’t end there though. Even with Hiranyakashipu out of the picture, Narasimha is still really, really angry, and afraid that his anger issues would destroy the world, the gods beseech Shiva to do something. Of course, the only way to tackle a powerful mythical creature is to turn into a powerful mythical creature yourself. Shiva becomes Sharabha – a half-lion (to match Narasimha, understandably) and half-bird form (the OG Angry Bird) – and manages to subdue Narasimha. The story is still not over, because Narasimha becomes Angrier Bird – taking on the form of Gandeberunda, a gigantic two-headed bird with Hulk-like strength. Sharabha, thankfully, calls it quits after 18 days of fighting and Gandeberunda also finally calms down. This powerful bird happens to be the state emblem of Karnataka, and the Gandeberunda motif can be found in many places in India, including temple architecture.\n\nGandeberunda\nDecorative motif on the ceiling of Brihadeeswarar temple\nBhoota Vahana Yantra\nIt appears that robots are quite ancient. According to an 11th-century text, when Buddha died, it fell to King Ajatashatru of Magadha to protect his sacred relics. Ajatashatru concealed the relics in a secret underground chamber in his capital, Pataliputra (now Patna in Bihar). And the warriors who stood guard were automatons, but not just any automatons though. Bhoota Vahana Yantra literally means ‘spirit movement machine’, so these robots had spirits inside them that were responsible for their movements. Needless to say, these robots made excellent guards. \n\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}
