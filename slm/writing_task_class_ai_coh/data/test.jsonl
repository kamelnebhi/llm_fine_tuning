{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home in India is a significant milestone, but the process can be quite complex and time-consuming. The first step is to determine your budget and preferred location. Housing prices vary widely across the country, with cities like Mumbai and Delhi having some of the highest prices, averaging around INR 26,780 per square foot in Mumbai. Once you've identified a property, the next step is to apply for a home loan.\n\nApplying for a home loan involves several steps, including assessing your eligibility, choosing a lender, and selecting the right loan product. You'll need to fill out an application form and provide various documents such as ID proof, address proof, income statements, and property documents. The lender will then verify your information and conduct a property valuation before approving the loan. Interest rates for home loans in India currently range from 8.35% to 14.50% per annum, depending on the lender and loan amount.\n\nUsing a real estate agent or mortgage broker can be beneficial, especially for first-time buyers. Real estate agents can help you find suitable properties and negotiate prices, while mortgage brokers can assist in finding the best loan deals and navigating the application process. However, their services come at an additional cost. Overall, while buying a home in India can be challenging, proper planning and the right assistance can make the process smoother and more manageable.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Leaflet drops and loudspeaker broadcasts were used to simulate influencing civilian populations and enemy morale. The messages were well-timed and targeted, but their overall impact was limited due to insufficient coordination with ground units and a lack of real-time intelligence updates.\n\nOne key observation is that PsyOps personnel were not fully integrated into the planning phase, which led to missed opportunities for stronger influence during key moments of the exercise. Additionally, the absence of local language specialists reduced the authenticity and effectiveness of the messaging.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nIntegrate PsyOps teams earlier in the planning process to ensure alignment with operational goals.\n\nIncrease use of real-time intel to adapt messaging as situations evolve.\n\nInvest in language and cultural training to enhance message credibility.\n\nConduct joint rehearsals with ground units to improve timing and coordination.\n\nImproving these aspects will ensure that future operations gain maximum psychological advantage with minimal resource investment.

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning is a rewarding but often challenging journey. Students face a variety of obstacles that can hinder their progress. One major issue is lack of confidence—many learners fear making mistakes, which can prevent them from speaking or writing freely. This fear often stems from perfectionism or negative past experiences.\n\nAnother common challenge is limited exposure to the language outside the classroom. Without regular practice in real-life situations, it’s difficult to retain vocabulary and grammar. Learners may also struggle with pronunciation and listening comprehension, especially when native speakers talk quickly or use slang.\n\nMotivation is another key factor. Language learning requires consistent effort over time, and students may lose interest if they don’t see immediate results. Additionally, differences in learning styles can affect progress—some students thrive with visual aids, while others prefer interactive or auditory methods.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, learners can ask themselves:\n\nHow can I create more opportunities to use the language daily?\nWhat strategies help me remember new words or grammar rules?\nHow can I make learning more enjoyable and less stressful?\nBy identifying their personal obstacles and experimenting with different techniques, students can build confidence and make steady progress in their language journey.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 8.0 [SEP] Prompt: You haven't received a confirmation email from the hotel. Write a short email to confirm your booking. Use the text to help you. Write 50 - 70 words. [SEP] Response: Antonio Banditeros, reputed to be the biggest drug trafficker on the East Coast, was ordered held without bail Tuesday on federal drug and gun charges.\n\nJudge Barry McDrew’s decision to detain Banditeros until his trial marks the culmination of the highly publicized war on drugs. Drug enforcement agents last week carried out what has been called the biggest drug bust in more than a decade. Banditeros was taken in a sting operation in an otherwise quiet penthouse suite overlooking Central Park.\n\nBanditeros faces various drug smuggling charges, including conspiring to distribute cocaine and heroin. If convicted, he could receive a life sentence, prosecutors said. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nDEA officials say Banditeros’ far-reaching recruitment allowed officials to plant undercover agents in his organization and, after a year-long investigation, gather enough evidence to bring down the core of his operation.\n\nAccording to court records, Banditeros started drug pushing on New York City streets as a teenager. “He wasn’t interested in just selling marijuana to college kids with substance abuse problems,” said the DEA official who masterminded the sting operation. “From the moment he set foot in the Empire State, this guy had his eye on building his own drug-smuggling empire.”\n\nBanditeros aspired to become the baron of a multimillion-dollar drug cartel, and he scouted for partners within the justice system as well as in low-income neighborhoods, according to documents filed in the case. With the help of these accomplices, he was able to create a global organization whose sole purpose was to control the price and flow of illegal drugs in New York and elsewhere.\n\nIn addition, several secondary leaders also were detained, including Jerry Green, reputed right-hand man of Banditeros. He is also being held without bail pending trial. ", "task_id": "57251d37-a835-4f6c-aec1-49910b3e4d9c", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: Paris and Tokyo are two of the world’s most iconic cities, but they offer vastly different experiences, each captivating in its own way. Paris, my favorite city, is a place where history and beauty merge effortlessly. The city is renowned for its romantic charm, from the grand boulevards to the intimate cafés lining the Seine River. Paris’s architecture is a blend of classical grandeur and modern artistry—monuments like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum stand as symbols of France’s rich cultural history, while contemporary structures like the Fondation Louis Vuitton add a touch of innovation. Strolling through neighborhoods like Le Marais or Montmartre, with their cobblestone streets and boutique shops, evokes a sense of timeless elegance and artistic inspiration.\n\nIn contrast, Tokyo represents a fascinating contrast, where centuries-old traditions exist side-by-side with the cutting-edge modernity of technology and urban design. The skyline, filled with towering skyscrapers, is a testament to the city’s rapid growth, while ancient temples such as Senso-ji provide serene sanctuaries amidst the city’s hustle and bustle. Tokyo’s efficient public transportation system, with its punctual trains and sprawling subway network, makes it easy to navigate the sprawling metropolis. Unlike Paris’s leisurely pace, Tokyo is fast-moving and high-energy, with districts like Shibuya and Akihabara buzzing with life and technology at every corner.\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

Whether it's starting a new job, moving to a different city, or adjusting to unexpected circumstances, change challenges us to grow and adapt. Although it can be uncomfortable at first, change often brings new opportunities and fresh perspectives.\n\nMany people resist change because it brings uncertainty. It takes us out of our comfort zones and forces us to confront the unknown. However, resisting change can hold us back from reaching our full potential. By embracing it, we open the door to personal development and transformation.\n\nTo make the most of change, it’s important to stay positive, set clear goals, and remain flexible. Accepting that not everything is within our control allows us to focus on what we can influence. Even setbacks can become stepping stones toward success when we adopt a mindset of growth.\n\nSurrounding ourselves with supportive people and taking time to reflect can also help during transitons.

Its impact on regional economic integration and cooperation has been substantial, and it continues to shape trade policies and practices in the region.\n\nIn 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which builds upon the foundation established by NAFTA and addresses new trade issues, such as digital trade and labor rights.\n", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: How to find counterfeit goods\n\nHere is the way to find counterfeit goods when you do shopping.\nBe aware of those statements and call the police as soon as you think you accidentally perchaced counterfeit goods.\n\nCounterfeit goods are anywhere in the world these days. They are fake products designed to imitate genuine items such as luxury fashin, electronics, CDs, DVDs, medicines, and even food. While they may seem like a bargein, they come with serious risks. We should know that.\n\nThe Impact of Counterfeit Goods on Society\nCounterfeiting harms businesses by reducing sales and damaging brand reputation. Governments lose tax revenue, affecting public services. More importantly, counterfeit goods can be dangerous—fake medicines may contain harmful substances, and counterfeit electronics often fail safety standards. Additionally, counterfeit trade is linked to organized crime, funding illegal activities.\n\nHow to recognize a Fake?\nRecognizing counterfeit goods is crucial. Signs include poor-quality materials, incorrect logos, and suspiciously low prices. Authentic products often have serial numbers, security tags, or certificates of authenticity. If a deal seems too good to be true, it likely is. Check the website of the company (shopping site) who runs the business. You can check the comments form the viewers or customers as well.\nYou can find some negative comments from there and find out if it's suspecious.\n\nWhat to Do If You Discover Counterfeit Goods\nIf you suspect a product is fake, avoid buying it. Report counterfeit goods to brand owners, consumer protection agencies, or law enforcement. Purchasing fake goods supports illegal trade and harms businesses. By spreading awareness, you can help prevent counterfeiting.\n\nStaying informed protects both consumers and businesses.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write a description of a legendary creature that’s popular in your country, or one you find interesting. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: One of the most fascinating legendary creatures from India is the **Naga**, a serpent deity revered in Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Nagas are often depicted as half-human, half-serpent beings, possessing immense power and wisdom. They are believed to reside in the underworld, guarding treasures and sacred knowledge.\n\nNagas are both revered and feared. In Hindu mythology, they are associated with water bodies like rivers, lakes, and seas, and are considered protectors of these natural resources. They are also linked to fertility and prosperity, often invoked in rituals for rain and good harvests.\n\nIn Buddhist lore, Nagas are seen as protectors of the Buddha and his teachings. One famous story tells of the Naga king Mucalinda, who shielded the Buddha from a storm by coiling around him and spreading his hood to provide shelter.\n\nDespite their fearsome appearance, Nagas are generally benevolent, rewarding those who respect them and punishing those who desecrate their domains. Their dual nature as both protectors and potential threats makes them a captivating subject in Indian folklore and mythology.\n\nI hope you find this description intriguing!

{"text": "Prompt Level: 8.0 [SEP] Prompt: Your teacher has asked you to write a short text about the parts of an airplane. Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The main body of an aircraft is known as the fuselage. It typically has a long, narrow, tubular shape designed to minimize air resistance and enhance aerodynamic efficiency. Inside the fuselage is the cabin, where the flight crew and passengers are accommodated throughout the journey. The landing gear is housed in the lower section of the fuselage and can be retracted after takeoff and deployed again during landing.\n\nExtending from either side of the fuselage are the wings, which are fundamental to generating lift. They are slightly curved—a design feature known as an airfoil—that allows air to move more quickly over the top surface than the bottom, creating the lift necessary for flight. Attached to the rear edge of the wings are flaps, which are hinged control surfaces. When lowered, flaps increase the curvature and surface area of the wing, enhancing lift during critical phases such as takeoff and landing.\n\nThe stability of the aircraft is largely maintained by the tail assembly, located at the rear of the plane. The vertical component of the tail is referred to as the vertical stabilizer or fin, which helps maintain directional stability. Attached to it is the rudder, a movable surface that enables the aircraft to yaw, or turn left and right, during flight.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

Don't be surprised if the server gives you his or her first name. Most restaurants want you to feel comfortable, so servers are often informal but polite.\nYour server will also ask you a lot of questions about your order – questions like 'How would you like that?' and 'What kind of dressing would you like on the salad?' After you start eating, your server may also come back to the table several times, asking, 'How is everything?' Don't worry; that's normal. Tell the server what you think, honestly and politely. The server wants to make sure you get exactly what you want and that you are pleased with your food.\nAfter you've eaten, you may still have some food on your plate. That's fine. Your server might ask 'Would you like to take that home with you?' If you do want to take the food home to eat later, the server will put the food in a package 'to go.'\nFinally, it's important to give your server a tip before you leave.

This mainly includes cleaning of the houses, serving at restaurants, airports and casinos. However, with the growing technology, the use of robots is only increasing. This, on one hand, is very useful for the growth of nation, as the tasks will be performed by robots in minimum time and zero errors. However, it will take up a lot of resources from the nature to experiment and build such perfect robots. This seems quite far fetched. Also, with the increase in automation using robots, humans are losing out on their jobs and livelihood. This is not only damaging for the mankind, but also for the future generations. With the increasing dependency on artificial intelligence, humans, especially younger generation, is becoming lazy and inefficient. Human beings are blessed with high IQs and EQs. One thing that would be really hard to achieve is the emotional quotient in a robot, as that would require number of permutations and combinations of emotional reactions, which is certainly hard to predict. Use of a robot should be limited to clerical and mechanical jobs. Human intervention is necessary to ensure uniqueness and creativity in life.

The estimated cost of the project is $4 million.\n\nStrategic summary \nThe AccomData Group, which we commissioned to carry out market research, reported that this project follows the growing trend for weekend getaways to relaxing resorts and greater attention to healthy lifestyles. Their research showed that the cuisine in most fitness centres was unsatisfactory and that our target customer would be attracted by the chance of a healthy menu with top chefs from renowned restaurants and fully equipped gyms and swimming pools with trained instructors.\nThe estimated construction time is two years.\n\nWe predict an almost immediate return on investment. By the end of the second year, projected revenues will show a surplus of $1 million. We guarantee that \"Zen\" will recoup its investment within four years and begin to make a profit within five years.\n\nRisk Assessment \nUsing a reputable insurance company to carry out a risk assessment analysis, we've factored any possible economic downturn into our projected revenues and profits. Our projections have taken into account all worst-case scenarios.\nIf the economy remains stable, the time required to recoup investments and realise profits could be cut in half.\nWe've already engaged Kudos Advertising Agency to plan and design an extensive media and advertising campaign.

Many people become so caught up in their daily responsibilities—work, family obligations, social commitments—that they forget to prioritize their mental and physical well-being. Engaging in activities like meditation, exercise, reading, or simply spending time in nature can significantly reduce stress levels and improve overall health.

Be sure to keep the following points in mind: Types of counterfeit goods, the effect of counterfeiting on society, the signs of a fake, what to do if you discover fake goods.  Write 250-300 words. [SEP] Response: \nPositive thinking is more than just a mindset—it is a powerful tool that can transform your entire life. When you focus on the good, even in difficult situations, you train your mind to see opportunities instead of obstacles. This simple shift in perspective can improve your mood, relationships, health, and success.\n\nPeople who practice positive thinking are often more resilient. They bounce back from failure faster and learn from their mistakes. They approach challenges with confidence and believe in their ability to grow and improve. This optimism creates a sense of hope that helps them keep moving forward, even when times are tough.\n\nPositive thinking also affects physical health. Studies show that people with a positive outlook are less likely to suffer from stress-related illnesses. They often sleep better, have lower blood pressure, and enjoy better overall well-being.\n\nOf course, staying positive doesn’t mean ignoring reality or pretending that everything is perfect. It means choosing to face life with courage and faith, trusting that things can get better. It involves gratitude, self-compassion, and surrounding yourself with supportive people.\n\nYou can develop positive thinking by practicing daily affirmations, setting realistic goals, and focusing on what you can control. Even small habits like smiling more or writing down things you're thankful for can make a big difference.\n\nIn a world full of negativity and pressure, choosing positivity is a powerful act. It can change your life and inspire those around you. So, no matter where you are in your journey, remember: your thoughts have power. Choose them wisely, and you can create a brighter future—one positive step at a time.\n\n\n", "task_id": "788dc6fa-5111-4a7c-b2c1-a9ddebd0b1a2", "ef_level": 11.0, "label": 0}

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: Recent Performance\nShort-term Trends:\nThe Hang Seng Index has experienced steady growth over the past six months, primarily driven by investment from Mainland China. This trend is visually represented by the upward trajectory seen in the chart, indicating a rise from a low of 20,956 to a high of 27,499.\nSector Analysis:\nThe Properties and Utilities sub-indices have seen significant increases, attributed to growth from Mainland China. This indicates a focused investment interest in these sectors, which are traditionally seen as stable and essential parts of the economy.\nInfluencing Factors\nEconomic Indicators:\nThe growth in the HSI is heavily influenced by financial inflows from Mainland China, suggesting strong economic ties and dependency. This indicates that economic policies or developments in China could have substantial impacts on the performance of the index.\nFuture Outlook\nAnalyst Predictions:\nExperts predict continued upward movement for the HSI over the next year. This optimism is based on anticipated massive investment from other countries and robust internal demand within Hong Kong. These factors suggest a positive environment for investor confidence moving forward.\nConclusion\nInvestment Implications:\nThe recent data implies that investors might consider the Hang Seng Index as a viable option, given its current growth trajectory and positive outlook.

Compare your notes with the model text at the end. [SEP] Response: Notepad\n\nConfidential\n\nPANTASIA – Background Information for Deploying Units\n\nThe situation in the Federation of Pantasia began to cause the international community concern a year ago when an election resulted in a vote to break up the federation and form two separate countries for its two main ethnic groups, the Alphas and the Betas. Fighting broke out for control of the mineral-rich Argos Region, as well as between certain minority groups who were made refugees. There is also evidence of an attempt at ethnic cleansing of a minority group.\n\nSix months ago the military staged a coup to reunite the Federation. Although a large portion of the armed forces have returned to Federal control, elements have remained loyal to the new governments of Alpha and Beta. These armies have had small battles between themselves over disputed territories while resisting operations by the Federal forces based in Federal Territory.\n\nUntil a month ago the situation was a stalemate, however, the various factions have been rearming under the pretence of negotiations. Recently, strong leadership in Beta has resulted in a campaign that has pinned down Federal forces and Beta forces have also launched an all-out attack through Alpha territory to seize valuable land in Argos.\n\nThis has resulted in considerable civilian casualties, refugees and dislocation of population. There are reports of executions, rape, destruction of property and infrastructure. It is also believed that Beta has established concentration camps as part of its ethnic cleansing policy.\n\nApart from the problems of the ongoing conflicts, there has been the constant threat of hunger for the civilians in the area.  Earlier in the year the weather was unusually cold and dry, which resulted in crop failures. In recent weeks heavy rains have caused flooding and the destruction of bridges, roads and rail links, cutting off some of the most vulnerable villages.\n\nAs a result of the conflict and because of humanitarian concerns, Chapter VII of the UN Charter was invoked by a special resolution with strong rules of engagement (ROE) to impose peace, separate the warring factions and provide humanitarian care. An Implementation Phase, involving air power supported by ground troops, will be launched at 0600 hours on Monday unless the factions lay down their arms. This seems increasingly unlikely.\n\nIn addition to war-fighting the infantry units will be expected to conduct humanitarian operations, to protect people and improve basic facilities. The Implementation Phase is expected to last one month and then turn into a Stabilization Phase, although it is possible that the war fighting phase will last longer. During the Stabilization Phase, infantry units will be ensuring peace and security while a new government takes over and NGOs enter the country to assist the civilian population. Some units will also be involved in direct humanitarian work.\n\nConfidential", "task_id": "cffee9ec-0e17-4031-aeca-2723113def03", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 0}

This event, which could have been devastating, became a source of inspiration. Bill, rescued by a ship, decided that his life would not be defined by fear, but by the courage to create something new. It reminds us that inspiration can strike in the most unexpected and challenging times.\n\nSince then, our trajectory has been one of exponential growth.

Use the notes to help you. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: *Abstract:*\n\nThis report presents the discovery of a new bird species closely related to the American Robin (Turdus migratorius). DNA testing revealed distinct genetic differences, confirming the new species' classification within the Turdidae family and Turdus genus. Morphologically, the new species is characterized by its slightly smaller size, larger bill, and rustier coloration in males. Notably, it exhibits a unique migratory pattern, remaining north of the southern United States during winter, unlike the American Robin. Phylogenetic analysis supports its placement within the Animal Kingdom, Chordata phylum, Aves class, and Passeriformes order. The new species' classification is proposed as Turdus canadensis, reflecting its prevalence in Canada. This discovery expands our understanding of avian diversity and highlights the importance of genetic analysis in identifying and classifying bird species.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 8.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write a summary of the medical profession as outlined in the previous article. Compare your text with the model. This is a non-graded activity. [SEP] Response: The medical profession is one of the largest and fastest-growing industries in the U.S., employing around 13 million people. It combines medical technology with human interaction to help improve people's health. The demand for healthcare services is increasing, particularly in emergency treatment, therapy, and long-term care. The profession has evolved with advancements in technology, offering new diagnostic and treatment methods like organ transplants, less invasive surgeries, and gene therapy. These developments have improved survival rates and quality of life for many individuals.\n\nMedical professionals work in various settings, including hospitals, outpatient care centers, and home healthcare services. Careers in medicine vary widely in salary and working conditions, with some roles, such as nursing aides, earning lower salaries, and others, like surgeons, earning significantly more. However, a medical career typically requires many years of study and continuing education to keep up with medical advancements.\n\nThe profession has both benefits and drawbacks. While healthcare jobs are often well-paid and in high demand, they also require long, irregular hours, and the workload can be stressful. Despite these challenges, many people find a career in medicine to be rewarding, especially since they may have the opportunity to save lives.", "task_id": "919c4050-62f4-4659-92e0-b8a696061e03", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become an integral part of modern business practices, reflecting a company's commitment to ethical behavior, sustainable development, and community engagement. The postings on this topic reveal a spectrum of opinions, ranging from enthusiastic support to skeptical criticism.\n\nProponents argue that CSR initiatives foster a positive public image, enhance customer loyalty, and attract top talent. Companies like Patagonia and Ben & Jerry's are often cited as exemplars, demonstrating that ethical practices can coexist with profitability. These businesses have successfully integrated environmental stewardship and social equity into their core operations, proving that CSR can be a win-win strategy for both the company and society.\n\nCritics, however, contend that CSR is often a facade, a marketing gimmick designed to distract from less savory business practices. They point to instances where companies engage in \"greenwashing,\" promoting environmentally friendly initiatives while continuing harmful practices behind the scenes. This skepticism underscores the need for transparency and accountability in CSR efforts.\n\nIn my view, CSR is not just a moral imperative but a strategic necessity in today's interconnected world. Companies wield significant influence and resources, and with that comes the responsibility to contribute positively to society. Effective CSR requires genuine commitment, clear goals, and measurable outcomes. It should be embedded in the company's culture and operations, rather than being treated as an afterthought or a mere public relations tool.\n\nUltimately, the true measure of CSR's success lies in its impact. When done right, CSR can drive meaningful change, fostering a more sustainable and equitable world while also benefiting the business itself. Therefore, companies should strive to move beyond superficial gestures and embrace CSR as a core component of their identity and strategy.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Buying a home in the United States can be a complex and time-consuming process, but it can also be a rewarding experience. Applying for a home loan requires submitting a significant amount of financial information and documentation, including income verification, credit reports, and asset statements.\n\nThe process typically involves pre-approval, where a lender provides an estimate of the loan amount and interest rate. Once a property is selected, the buyer must submit a formal loan application, which may require additional documentation.\n\nHousing prices in the United States vary significantly depending on location, with cities like San Francisco and New York tend to be more expensive. Interest rates fluctuate based on market conditions, but currently range from around 3.5% to 4.5% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nWhile not necessary, working with a real estate agent and mortgage broker can simplify the process and provide valuable guidance. Agents can help find properties and navigate local markets, while brokers can assist with loan applications and securing the best interest rates.\n\nBe aware, do some research about the best Agents in your City.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 15.0 [SEP] Prompt: Apply the language you've learned in this lesson to a new topic: language learning. Write about issues and challenges that language students often face. Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language students often encounter various issues and challenges that can hinder their learning experience. What are the most common obstacles? One significant challenge is the complexity of grammar rules. Understanding tenses, articles, and sentence structure can be daunting, leading to frustration.\n\nAnother common issue is vocabulary acquisition. How can students effectively retain new words? Memorization is often insufficient; students may struggle with using vocabulary in context, which can stifle their speaking and writing abilities.\n\nPronunciation also poses a challenge. Why is it difficult for students to produce sounds that do not exist in their native language? This can affect their confidence and ability to communicate effectively. Additionally, the fear of making mistakes often prevents students from practicing speaking, further impeding their progress.\n\nCultural nuances present another layer of complexity. How do language students navigate idiomatic expressions and cultural references? These elements are vital for fluency and understanding the context in which language is used.\n\nLastly, what role does motivation play in language learning? Students may face a lack of motivation due to slow progress or overwhelming material. It’s essential for educators to foster an encouraging environment and provide tools to address these challenges, making the learning process more enjoyable and effective.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

Make notes of the key information so that you can use them to give orders to your troops later. Write between 100 and 150 words. [SEP] Response: Careers are available for men and women irrespective of race, ethnic origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation or social background. (N.B. The RAF Regiment, which is a specialist fighting force, is not open to women, for reasons of combat effectiveness.)\n\nCareers are available for school leavers with minimal qualifications and also for young people who have specialist skills or university degrees. It is unlikely that young people without qualifications will be promoted to the highest ranks. However, it is possible if they gain qualifications during their RAF career. They are encouraged to do so.\n\nSchool leavers can apply at age 16 and learn a trade through on-the-job training.\n\nStudents who have stayed on at school and achieved pass marks or higher in national exams have an increased number of career options available. School leavers will join as aircraftmen or women and during their careers may be promoted to the highest non-commissioned ranks and, in some cases, become commissioned officers.\n\nUniversity graduates enter as officers. Sponsorships are available for students in the last two years at school and/or in university.\n\nThere are over 50 different careers in the RAF. Ask the young person about  interests and skills before giving advice about specific careers. Use the materials you have been given, which will help you match the young person with suitable jobs.\n\nMany applicants are interested in jobs that will put them on board aircraft. Explain that this is more likely if the young person is a graduate or has specific qualifications. However, school leavers who join as non-commissioned aircrew (NCA) will train as weapon systems operators and will work on board fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters and may specialize in acoustics, electronic warfare or linguistics. The training for these jobs is up to three years. On completing training, there is automatic promotion to sergeant.\n\nYoung people wishing to become pilots can apply on leaving school at 17.5 years old or older. They must have good results in national examinations. They should be encouraged to apply for sponsorship and given advice about subjects to study at school and university. Explain that the young person will be tested in order to establish their aptitude for a career as a pilot. Also explain that once they have completed their elementary flying training, they will be streamed to fly fast jets, multi-engine aircraft or helicopters according to their capabilities. Not all pilots are fighter pilots. Many pilots spend their careers ferrying troops or supplies.\n\nThere is a shortage of air traffic controllers. Encourage school leavers to consider this job. They must have a minimum of five good results in the national exams taken at age 16. These must include English and maths. They will have to take aptitude tests and will join as non-commissioned aircrew. ", "task_id": "4c7e3fcb-8c2b-46a7-b947-838fab5fb577", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 0}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write a criticism of a celebrity. It can be a particular celebrity or the whole idea of celebrity in general. Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The concept of celebrity, as it exists today, is a reflection of society's misguided values. Celebrities are often celebrated for little more than their superficial charm or attention-grabbing antics, which tend to overshadow genuine talent or meaningful contributions. Take, for example, someone like Kim Kardashian. While she has built an empire based on social media presence and reality television, her influence has often been marked by vanity and excess rather than any notable achievements. Rather than offering anything of depth or substance, her brand relies on the perpetual reinforcement of materialism, beauty standards, and self-promotion.\n\nThis obsession with celebrity distracts from more important figures and accomplishments in our society. It often elevates individuals who are famous simply for being famous, without any real regard for intellectual or moral merit. It creates a toxic cycle where fame is equated with success, while those who contribute meaningfully to society—scientists, educators, social workers—are ignored. The celebrity culture perpetuates the idea that being in the public eye is more important than cultivating wisdom or contributing to the well-being of others.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: In my lifetime, media has undergone a remarkable transformation. Not too long ago, traditional forms of media such as print newspapers, magazines, and television were the primary sources of information and entertainment. People would sit down with a physical newspaper or watch scheduled broadcasts on TV. For me, these media were central to how I consumed news, stories, and even how I learned new things. Fast forward to today, and digital media has taken over. I now use a variety of platforms, including social media, news websites, and streaming services, to access information and entertainment. These digital platforms are much more instantaneous and interactive, offering real-time updates, personalized content, and on-demand viewing. The shift to digital has definitely changed my reading habits: I read more articles and short-form content online, often on my phone or computer, and spend less time with print media. This shift has also led to a faster-paced consumption of information, as I quickly scroll through news feeds rather than taking the time to read long articles or books.", "task_id": "7e0827d0-955c-484a-8c4f-81fe6a574af8", "ef_level": 11.0, "label": 5}

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the techniques introduced, **metaphor** and **loop writing** stand out as particularly useful to me. Metaphors allow me to express complex ideas in a more relatable and vivid way by comparing something unfamiliar with something familiar. For example, describing a difficult situation as \"walking through a storm\" instantly conveys the intensity of the experience, adding depth and emotion. This technique helps me engage readers and make abstract ideas more tangible, enhancing the overall impact of my writing.\n\nOn the other hand, **loop writing** has proven valuable for developing and refining my ideas. This technique involves writing freely on a topic and then circling back to earlier points, refining them as I go. It helps me uncover new insights and deepen my understanding of the subject matter, which is especially useful during brainstorming or first drafts. By constantly revisiting and expanding on my thoughts, loop writing allows me to create a more cohesive and well-developed piece of writing.

For instance, Mexican fruits and vegetables now flow freely into the US2. While NAFTA has had both positive and negative impacts on its members, it has generally benefited all three countries by fostering economic growth and enhancing trade opportunities3. Despite some controversies, the agreement has played a crucial role in shaping the economic landscape of North America.\n Most economic analyses indicate that NAFTA was beneficial to the North American economies and the average citizen, although it harmed a small minority of workers in industries exposed to trade competition.\n The agreement also includes chapters covering rules of origin, customs procedures, agriculture and sanitary measures, government procurement, investment, trade in services, protection of intellectual property rights, and dispute settlement procedures", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

When it comes to motivating your team, one of the most effective strategies is to lead by example. Show enthusiasm for the work, and your team will be more likely to follow your lead. Recognize and celebrate individual achievements, both big and small. This boosts morale and reinforces a positive atmosphere.\n\nAdditionally, it’s important to create an environment where open communication is encouraged. Make sure team members feel comfortable sharing their ideas and concerns. Listening actively and providing constructive feedback shows that you value their input.\n\nIn terms of strategies to avoid, I would recommend steering clear of micromanaging. It can lower employee morale and create a lack of trust. Also, avoid one-size-fits-all approaches. People are motivated by different factors, so it's important to understand each team member’s individual needs and goals.\n\nLastly, provide opportunities for growth and development.

They are employed in the automotive and electronics industries to enhance precision and efficiency, thereby reducing costs and improving production. Many farmers have started using automated machines for irrigation and harvesting.

[SEP] Response: Hi dear reader! \nBeing a doctor is a challenging yet rewarding profession that requires dedication, resilience, and a lifelong commitment to learning. Medical professionals have a wide range of career options, including working in hospitals, private clinics, research institutions, academia, or even public health organizations. Specialties vary from surgery and cardiology to dermatology and psychiatry, allowing doctors to choose a field that best suits their interests and skills. Medical training is extremely demanding, involving years of rigorous study, clinical rotations, and residency programs that test both mental and physical endurance. The workload is heavy, and the stress can be overwhelming, but the ability to save lives and improve patients' well-being makes it worthwhile. While doctors generally earn enough to live comfortably, salaries depend on specialization, location, and experience. Working in a hospital is fast-paced, often requiring long and unpredictable shifts, whereas clinics may offer a more structured routine. Despite the challenges, being a doctor is a fulfilling career that provides purpose and the opportunity to make a real difference in people’s lives.", "task_id": "ae90d852-9ab7-47ca-a8f8-4a90eaec83f4", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: My Opinion on Corporate Social Responsibility\nI strongly believe that companies have a responsibility not just to their shareholders, but also to society. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is not just a marketing strategy or a trend-it's a reflection of a company's values and long-term vision.\nFirstly, businesses do not operate in isolation. They benefit from public infrastructure, local labor, and government services. In return it's only fair that they give back to the communities they profit from. Supporting education, healthcare, environmental sustainability, and fair labor practices are just a few examples of how companies can make a positive impact.\nSecondly, CSR actually strengthens businesses in the long run. Consumers today are more conscious than ever about where their money goes. Companies that are socially responsible gain customer loyalty, improve employee morale, and attract better talent. This leads to higher productivity and ultimately, better financial performance.\nCritics argue that a company's only responsibility is to generate profit for shareholders. However, focusing solely on profits can damage reputation, invite public backlash, or even lead to stricter regulations. Being socially responsible can prevent these risks and ensure long-term stability.\nIn conclusion, CSR is not a distraction from business-it's an essential part of modern business strategy. Companies that embrace it are not just doing good; they are building a foundation for sustainable success.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Just like those brave seafarers who risked calamity for a chance to visit the farthest corners of Earth, these trailblazers are laying the groundwork for what may eventually become a mainstay of the travel industry: mass space tourism. To be sure, travel agents won't be able to find too many guys eager to shell out $20 million to become human cannonballs. But if the price comes down – forget the sky – not even Earth's substratosphere is the limit. Earlier this year, Zogby International, a private polling firm, surveyed hundreds of affluent Americans (net worth: at least $1 million). One in five said they'd pay $100,000 for 15 minutes in space. That projects to thousands of potential customers and puts the annual market in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The concept of celebrity often leads to an unhealthy obsession with fame and superficial qualities. Many celebrities are criticized for prioritizing their public image over genuine talent or meaningful contributions to society. For instance, some celebrities seem more focused on maintaining their social media presence and engaging in publicity stunts rather than using their platform to advocate for important issues or support charitable causes. This can create a culture where superficiality is celebrated, and real achievements are overshadowed by the pursuit of fame. Additionally, the constant scrutiny and unrealistic expectations placed on celebrities can lead to personal struggles and mental health issues, which are often overlooked by the public. While there are certainly celebrities who use their influence for positive change, the overall idea of celebrity can sometimes promote values that are not conducive to personal growth or societal progress. It's important to recognize these issues and encourage a more balanced perspective on fame and success.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 0}

It holds passengers, cargo, and the cockpit where the pilots control the aircraft. It also connects the other parts of the plane, like the wings and tail.\n\nThe wings are essential for flight. They generate lift, allowing the airplane to rise off the ground. The shape of the wings helps to create the necessary airflow for this lift. They also have control surfaces, like flaps and ailerons, that help manage the airplane’s movement during flight.\n\nThe tail (also called the empennage) stabilizes the airplane. It consists of the vertical stabilizer, which helps keep the aircraft's nose pointed straight, and the horizontal stabilizer, which prevents the plane from tipping forward or backward. The rudder and elevators on the tail control turning and altitude changes.\n\nFinally, the engines provide the thrust that propels the airplane forward.

It aimed to eliminate most tariffs and trade barriers on goods, products and services exchanged between these countries. NAFTA came into effect on January 1, 1994, creating one of the world's largest free trade zones. The agreement facilitated increased trade and investment, contributing to economic growth in the member countries. However, it also faced criticism for its impact on employment and the environment. In 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Supporters of NAFTA estimate that around 14 million jobs rely on trade with Canada and Mexico, with nearly 200,000 export-related jobs created annually. However, critics argue that NAFTA is to blame for job losses and wage stagnation in the United States, as it led to outsourcing and the relocation of manufacturing jobs to Mexico.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 8.0 [SEP] Prompt: Review your notes and write a case report stating who was found guilty and why. Briefly comment on whether you found the verdict appropriate. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In this case, Medina was found guilty of trespassing after unlawfully entering the Byrons’ home during the night. Medina claimed he believed the house was empty and sought shelter from the night because he was scared. However, his actions, including ransacking the property, caused significant terror and emotional distress to the Byron family, who were understandably shaken by the intrusion. While it is unclear if Medina took any valuables, the court deemed his actions a criminal offense.\n\nAs a result, Medina was sentenced to pay a $1,000 fine, divided into two installments, one of which was to be paid immediately. Additionally, the court ordered him to complete 300 hours of community service as part of his punishment.\n\nThe verdict appears balanced and appropriate, considering the circumstances. It holds Medina accountable for his unlawful behavior while taking into account his stated intent of seeking shelter rather than causing harm. The imposed sentence combines financial and restorative penalties, emphasizing rehabilitation and fairness while deterring future misconduct of a similar nature.", "task_id": "bb0d114c-9550-4f27-9138-b2eb14c39437", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Setting up a new 5G network is no easy task, so I’ll try to break this down for you into small, easy-to-understand steps. In order to get government approval to roll out a new 5G network, we’ll have to demonstrate that we understand the existing mobile network and explain how we plan on integrating our own service.\n\nTo start with, our new service has to be able to communicate with and integrate into the current mobile network technology. This consists of a network of base stations, the core circuit switched network, which handles voice calls and text, a packet switched network, which handles mobile data, and the public switched telephone network to connect subscribers to the wider telephony network. Of course, we will also have to show that our service follows 5G standards, such as WCDMA.\n\nOnce this has been demonstrated to the proper governmental authorities, we need to prove that we will respect customers’ privacy with our new service. After that, we’ll have to show that we are following all the anti-monopoly regulation. This is to ensure that no one company takes control of the entire market.\n\nOnly when all of this has been completed, can we begin to approach mobile phone manufacturers, who will be able to supply the phones that will run our new service.\n\nFinally, after having passed all of these benchmarks, we will be in a very good position to gain government approval.

[SEP] Response: In the heart of Silicon Valley, there was a small startup called Techspire. Founded by a group of passionate young innovators, Techspire was determined to change the world with technology. Their mission was clear: to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence (AI) and everyday life, making smart solutions accessible to everyone.\n\nThe team, led by Sarah, a former software engineer at a large tech company, had been working tirelessly on a new AI-powered assistant that could predict users' needs before they even asked. Unlike other virtual assistants, this one would learn from a person's habits, preferences, and even moods, to provide tailored suggestions in real-time.\n\nFor months, the team worked around the clock, coding, testing, and refining their product. They faced numerous challenges—processing vast amounts of data, creating algorithms that could predict human behavior, and ensuring the system was user-friendly. But every time they hit a roadblock, they pushed through with determination, knowing the potential their creation held.\n\nFinally, after a year of hard work, the AI assistant was ready. It was launched with a simple slogan: \"Techspire: Your smart life, simplified.\" The response was overwhelming. People marveled at how the assistant seemed to know exactly what they needed. It could recommend recipes based on a person’s dietary restrictions, remind them of upcoming events, and even suggest ways to improve productivity based on their daily routines.\n\nTechspire became an overnight success, but the team didn’t stop there. They knew that technology was always evolving, and they were excited to be at the forefront of the next big thing. They were determined to keep innovating, pushing the boundaries of what technology could do, with the goal of improving lives in ways no one had ever imagined.", "task_id": "f5b9e75a-4373-4e94-86eb-0df64619d29a", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 0}

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: The Performance of the Hang Seng Index: A Steady Climb Amidst Global Investments\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI) in Hong Kong has experienced notable growth over the past six months, driven primarily by substantial investments from Mainland China. This influx of capital has significantly bolstered the index, reflecting a positive trend in the region's financial markets.\nSix months ago, the HSI faced a dip, dropping to 20,956 points. However, it has since rebounded impressively, reaching a high of 27,499 points. This recovery can be attributed to the robust performance of the Properties and Utilities Sub-indices, which have seen dramatic rises due to growth from China1234.\nExperts are optimistic about the future trajectory of the Hang Seng Index. They believe that the index will continue to rise in the coming year, fueled by massive investments from other countries and strong internal demand within Hong Kong5.\nIn summary, the Hang Seng Index has demonstrated resilience and growth, making it a focal point for investors looking to capitalize on the dynamic economic landscape of Hong Kong and its surrounding regions.\n", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Navagunjara is a fascinating creature from the Indian epic the Mahabharata, especially in the version told in Odisha called the Sarala Mahabharata. This mythical creature is made up of parts from different animals, symbolizing the diversity and unity of life.\n\nNavagunjara has the head of a rooster, the neck of a peacock, the back of a bull, the waist of a lion, the tail of a snake, and three legs from an elephant, a tiger, and a deer. It also has one human arm holding a lotus or a wheel. Each part represents different qualities, coming together to form one amazing being.\n\nIn the story, Navagunjara appears to Arjuna, one of the Pandava brothers, during his exile. While meditating, Arjuna sees this strange creature and is initially surprised by its unusual shape. However, he soon realizes that Navagunjara is actually Lord Krishna in disguise, testing his faith and understanding. Recognizing its divine nature Arjuna bows in respect understanding the deeper meaning of its form.\n\nThe story of Navagunjara teaches a lesson about unity in diversity showing how different elements can come together in harmony. This idea fits with the larger themes in the Mahabharata which celebrates the complexity and interconnectedness of life.\n\nIn Odisha, artists often depict Navagunjara in Pattachitra, a traditional style of painting on cloth. These artworks capture the creature's unique form with detailed and colorful designs reflecting its spiritual significance. Through these artistic expressions, the legend of Navagunjara continues to inspire people to think about the mysteries of life and the unity that connects everything.\n\nThe tale of Navagunjara is an important part of Odisha's rich storytelling tradition, blending myth, art, and philosophy into stories that share timeless wisdom and cultural identity.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

The NAFTA has had a profound impact on trade relations, especially in agriculture; for example, Mexican fruits and vegetables flow into the US.Additionally, NAFTA encouraged foreign direct investment, enhancing the competitiveness of industries within the bloc.\nNAFTA also faced criticism. Critics pointed to job losses in certain industries, particularly in manufacturing, due to companies relocating to Mexico for cheaper labor. Environmental concerns and the exploitation of workers were also points of contention.\nIn 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which updated key provisions to address modern trade challenges.

Set in the early 1990s in Los Angeles, the film is about two detectives investigating a series of murders, which lead them to a lonely stranger who may be the killer. The style of the film is called \"Neo-noir\" and is a style of cinema that uses much of the elements of film noir, but which deals with topics with current content, and in which aesthetically elements that were absent in film noir films of the 1940s and 1950s are observed.

[SEP] Response: The future of transportation will have to focus heavily on encouraging public transportation by road, but also, and especially, by rail.\nNew high-speed trains must be built that comply with current regulations and safety standards.\nFor road transportation, we must focus on hybrid vehicles.\nIn southern Italy, the Cumana and Vesuviana trains must certainly be modernized, adopting construction criteria that are geared toward greater safety compared to the past.\nIn terms of tourism, we must encourage the creation of new wellness centers where guests can recharge with relaxation and wellness programs.\nThere are now travel agencies that who specialize in trips into space, at least for those with enough money to pay for it. However, even though space tourism is targeted at the high-end market, perhaps one day it will reach the mass market and provide an extraordinary vacation for millions of ordinary tourists.

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is made up of several key parts, each serving a specific function to help it fly safely and efficiently.\n\nFuselage: This is the main body of the airplane, where passengers and cargo are stored. It houses the cockpit, where the pilots control the aircraft, and the cabin, where people sit during the flight. The fuselage also supports other components like the wings and engines.\n\nWings: The wings provide lift, which is necessary for the airplane to stay in the air. They are designed to create a difference in air pressure above and below the wing, allowing the plane to rise. The wings also often have flaps and ailerons to control the plane’s speed, altitude, and direction.\n\nTail: The tail includes the horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer (rudder). The horizontal stabilizer helps keep the airplane stable in the air and prevents unwanted pitching movements, while the rudder helps control the plane’s yaw, or left-to-right movement.\n\nEngines: Engines are responsible for generating the thrust needed to propel the airplane forward. Most airplanes have either jet engines or propellers that push or pull the aircraft through the air, allowing it to reach cruising speeds and altitudes.\n\nTogether, these parts make an airplane capable of flight, ensuring stability, control, and propulsion.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

Positively robots can help handle dangerous tasks, offer support in areas with workforce shortages, and drive technological innovation. However, their rise also poses challenges, such as job displacement for low-skilled workers and increasing economic inequality.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: I strongly believe that companies have a responsibility to society beyond just making profits for shareholders. Businesses do not operate in a vacuum—they rely on communities for labor, infrastructure, and customers. Therefore, it’s only fair that they give back in meaningful ways.\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is not just about charity; it’s about sustainable and ethical business practices. When companies invest in their communities, support education, reduce environmental harm, and treat employees fairly, they create a positive cycle. For example, offering fair wages and safe working conditions leads to happier employees, which in turn boosts productivity and reduces turnover. Similarly, supporting local education helps build a skilled future workforce, which benefits the company in the long run.\n\nCritics argue that CSR is just a marketing tool or that it distracts from profit-making. But I see it as a win-win. Consumers today are more socially conscious and prefer to support brands that align with their values. So, CSR can actually enhance a company’s reputation and profitability.\n\nIn conclusion, CSR should be an integral part of every company’s operations. It’s not just good ethics—it’s good business. Companies that embrace their social responsibilities are helping to build a better, more sustainable world for everyone.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Leonardo DiCaprio has long positioned himself as a champion of environmental causes, using his platform to raise awareness of issues like climate change and deforestation. However, his pious posturing often rings hollow when compared to his personal lifestyle. While he endorses sustainability, he continues to travel the world in private jets and luxury yachts, burning more fossil fuels in a single trip than the average person does in a year. This glaring double standard undermines his credibility and raises questions about whether he genuinely cares about the environment or simply enjoys being seen as its savior.\nLike many media-savvy celebrities, DiCaprio knows how to nourish a belief in his own virtue, carefully curating an image of activism while still earning big bucks from high-paying Hollywood deals and partnerships. Meanwhile, ordinary people are expected to make sacrifices - cutting meat, reducing flights, and consuming less -while he continues to live extravagantly.\nSomeone needs to take him down a peg or two and remind him that real change requires action, not just well-crafted speeches. If he truly wants to emulate a model of sustainability, he should start by practicing what he preaches. Otherwise, people will begin to bad-mouth his so-called activism for what it really is - hypocrisy dressed as heroism.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

It is said to reward those it favors with hidden riches but can also play tricks on people by moving objects, spilling liquids, or creating mysterious noises. Some believe the Monaciello to be the ghost of a benevolent monk, while others consider it a fairy-like being tied to the earth and its secrets.\n\nThe Monaciello's dual nature has made it a symbol of fortune and chaos in Neapolitan culture.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 14.0 [SEP] Prompt: You’re writing a brief performance review of your sales team member Oliver. Type in the input box. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: General performance\n\nOliver Murray had, without doubt, a very strong start with the company. He is only with us for a year now. He has interesting new ideas, and as a perfectionist, is making almost no mistakes. Oliver works hard to be successful, and he is unsually clever. He is an exemplary employee.\n\nKey achievements\n\nOliver's creative approach to product testing has saved us lots of money, as he found and fixed product errors. These proved to be so accurate and reliable that his line manager promoted him to senior analyst although she'd only been with us for six months by that time. Oliver has been employee of the month already two times.\n\nAreas for improvement\n\nOliver’s weaknesses lie in two key areas: time keeping and delegating. Even though he is a conscientious worker, he sometimes struggles to keep to deadlines. Therefore, his entire team occasionally falls behind schedule. With regard to delegating, Oliver fails to distribute work evenly among his team, often taking on more work personally than is pragmatic.\n\nGoals\n\nI would like to set the following two goals for Oliver. First, that he keeps an online team schedule, and updates it regularly. Second, that at the beginning of a task, he draws up a plan for a logical system of delegation based on employee availability, experience and proficiency. Meeting these goals will ensure Oliver is working to his fullest potential.", "task_id": "a3ec558f-a001-4ef0-9b71-cba2f237e7d2", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Developing leadership qualities involves a combination of self-awareness, continuous learning, and practical experience. From my observations, effective leaders often exhibit qualities such as empathy, integrity, and resilience.\n\nEmpathy allows leaders to understand and connect with their team members, fostering a supportive and collaborative environment. Integrity ensures that leaders act consistently with their values and principles, earning the trust and respect of others. Resilience helps leaders navigate challenges and setbacks, maintaining a positive outlook and motivating their team through difficult times.\n\nI believe everyone has the potential to be a leader, but it requires dedication and a willingness to grow. Leadership is not just about holding a position of authority; it's about influencing and inspiring others. By seeking feedback, embracing new experiences, and reflecting on their actions, individuals can develop their leadership skills.\n\nIn my experience, observing and learning from admired leaders can also be incredibly beneficial. Whether it's a mentor, a colleague, or a historical figure, understanding their approaches and strategies can provide valuable insights into effective leadership. Ultimately, leadership is a journey of continuous improvement and self-discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "ce3f3898-f2a7-4978-8f4f-17596f229f1d", "ef_level": 12.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: From: Ken  \nTo: Josh  \n\nSubject: Urgent Decision on Business Location  \n\nHi Josh,  \n\nWe really have to make a decision about our business. Our landlord just wrote me another letter about the rent. Next month, it will be raised 25% to $4,500 per month. That's going to eat even more into our profits. I mean, Josh, that's $54,000 a year!  \n\nI'm going to summarize our discussions here. I know that you are strongly in favor of just staying where we are and paying the higher rent. The obvious disadvantages of that are that our sales of clothing are increasing more slowly than our expenses AND with the rapid growth in Centerville, we can expect further rent increases in the coming months. The big pro for staying is that we're in a fashionable district where long-term customers know us. We're right downtown, so customers can come in on their lunch breaks to be measured for a suit or other high-end clothing.  \n\nYou know that I favor going to a completely different model. We move to the south end of town for making the clothes, but create a system where we meet people in their offices or schools to measure them for new clothes. We also open up a much better webpage than what we have now so that customers can view our clothing options and enter their measurements. Incredible cost savings! The con of that is that we lose the showroom, where customers can just come in and look at the possibilities, feel the cloth and talk to us about what would be appropriate for them. Far less personalized service, which has helped us build close relationships with our customers.  \n\nHonestly, I'd like another option, but I'm out of ideas. Should we talk to more people? I'm up for anything, but we really DO need to make a decision!  \n\nThanks!  \nKen", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 0}

For the classification, suggest a name for the new species and say why it’s suitable. Use the email as reference.\nIntroducing the New Bird Species: Sylvaticus emeritus\n\nDescription and Comparison: The Sylvaticus emeritus is a recently discovered bird species that exhibits striking differences and similarities when compared to the American robin (Turdus migratorius). It features vibrant plumage with a blend of emerald green and deep blue, contrasting with the more subdued orange and gray tones of the American robin. Its slender beak and slightly elongated tail give it a more elegant appearance.\n\nIn terms of habitat, while the American robin is commonly found in North American woodlands and urban areas, the Sylvaticus emeritus thrives in dense, tropical rainforests. It prefers the canopies, nesting in tall trees, and feeding on a variety of insects and fruits, unlike the American robin, which often forages on the ground.\n\nZoological Classification:\n\nKingdom: Animalia\n\nPhylum: Chordata\n\nClass: Aves\n\nOrder: Passeriformes\n\nFamily: Turdidae\n\nGenus: Sylvaticus\n\nSpecies: Sylvaticus emeritus\n\nSuggested Name and Rationale: The name \"Sylvaticus emeritus\" is apt for this species as \"Sylvaticus\" denotes its affinity for forested habitats, and \"emeritus\" signifies its distinguished and exceptional appearance among avian species. This nomenclature reflects both its ecological niche and its striking, regal presence in its natural environment.\n\nLet me know if you need any further details or another topic to explore!", "task_id": "fd6132f4-a3e2-4a63-b2d3-2336f120b95a", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: The Challenges of Language Learning: Overcoming Common Hurdles\n\nLearning a new language can be an exciting yet daunting journey. Many students face a variety of challenges that can make the process seem overwhelming. What are some of these common issues, and how can they be addressed?\n\nOne major challenge is vocabulary retention. Students often struggle to remember new words and phrases. This can be mitigated by using flashcards, engaging in regular practice, and immersing oneself in the language through media like movies, music, and books.\n\nAnother issue is pronunciation. Many learners find it difficult to master the sounds of a new language, especially if they are very different from their native tongue. Practicing with native speakers, using language learning apps, and listening to the language as much as possible can help improve pronunciation.\n\nGrammar is another stumbling block. The rules of a new language can be complex and different from what students are used to. Breaking down grammar rules into smaller, manageable parts and practicing them in context can make them easier to understand and remember.\n\nConfidence is also a significant barrier. Many students fear making mistakes and feel embarrassed when speaking. It's important to remember that making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process. Joining language exchange groups or practicing with friends can help build confidence.\n\nFinally, consistency is key. Regular practice is essential for language acquisition. Setting aside dedicated time each day for language study and practice can lead to steady progress.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Dear manager,\n\nAccording to the research I have recently done regarding the two training companies, TrainQuick and Skills Pro, here is the conclusion I have made.\n\nTrainQuick matches our requirement of being affordable and offer flexibility, however, one drawback is that people complains of being mixed with employees from other branches. This leads the platform to be eventually disliked by the employees.\nOn the other hand, we have SkillsPro, which offers high quality courses and even if it means a larger investment due to its cost, I believe it's worth the expense. Employees are challenged by the courses, and almost everyone finishes the courses successfully, which means that there is effort and they don't take it carelessly. In addition, they are planning the courses to be expanded.\n\nWith everything being mentioned, I suggest we continue investing in SkillsPro for our employees to have the development they deserve and the company continues its growth.", "task_id": "28757296-8797-428f-a562-0b03c304b341", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the various writing techniques, metaphor stands out as particularly useful for enhancing the depth and clarity of expression. By drawing comparisons between seemingly unrelated things, metaphors allow writers to convey complex ideas and emotions succinctly and vividly. For instance, describing a challenging situation as \"navigating a stormy sea\" evokes not only the turbulence of the experience but also the courage required to face it. This figurative language can create a more immersive experience for readers, enabling them to connect with the theme on a more personal level.\n\nAdditionally, symbolism serves as another powerful tool in writing. Symbols can encapsulate broader concepts within a singular object or action, enriching the narrative with layers of meaning. For example, a withering tree might symbolize loss or change, resonating with readers on a universal scale. By intertwining metaphor and symbolism, a writer can create a narrative that resonates deeply, inviting readers to explore the subtleties of the themes presented. Overall, these techniques not only enhance the richness of the writing but also foster a deeper connection between the text and its audience.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Developing leadership qualities requires a blend of self-awareness, continuous learning, and intentional practice. From personal observations and experiences, great leaders often share key traits: empathy, communication, adaptability, and integrity.\n\nEmpathy is foundational—it helps leaders understand and connect with others on a deeper level, fostering trust and collaboration. Communication is equally important, as clear, concise, and inspiring messages can guide a team toward shared goals. Adaptability allows leaders to navigate challenges and embrace change, while integrity ensures their actions align with their values, earning respect and loyalty.\n\nLeadership often begins with self-leadership: setting personal goals, managing time effectively, and cultivating discipline. Feedback from mentors or peers can also highlight areas for growth. I’ve seen people who were once quiet and hesitant transform into confident leaders after committing to self-improvement and stepping into challenging roles.\n\nI believe everyone has the potential to be a leader, but leadership takes different forms. Not all leaders are charismatic or outspoken; some lead quietly by example or excel in specific contexts. The key lies in recognizing one’s strengths, understanding others, and committing to growth.

[SEP] Response: The concept of celebrity has grown into something excessive, often prioritizing fame over real talent or meaningful contributions to society. Many celebrities achieve stardom not through skill or hard work but through controversy, social media antics, or sheer luck. While some use their influence responsibly, others seem more concerned with self-promotion than setting a good example. For instance, influencers and reality TV stars often gain millions of followers without showcasing any particular talent, yet they wield significant cultural influence.\n\nMoreover, the lavish lifestyles of celebrities can be frustrating to watch, especially when they flaunt their wealth while many people struggle to make ends meet. Instead of using their platform for positive change, some celebrities engage in tone-deaf behavior, making them seem out of touch with reality. While admiration for talent and hard work is understandable, the culture of celebrity worship has become problematic. It promotes unrealistic beauty standards, fuels materialism, and sometimes even encourages irresponsible behavior. Instead of idolizing celebrities, society should focus on valuing people for their character, intelligence, and contributions to the greater good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Fueling Success: The Power of a Free Breakfast\nImagine a morning where the day's biggest decision isn't \"scramble or cereal?\" but \"pancakes or pastries?\" This is the reality our company is ushering in with its new free breakfast program. Gone are the frantic mornings of juggling breakfast with the morning commute, replaced by a communal gathering fueled by fresh fruit, steaming coffee, and the camaraderie of colleagues.\nThis isn't just about nourishment; it's an investment in our collective well-being. Studies have shown that a healthy breakfast improves focus, boosts energy levels, and enhances overall productivity. By providing this vital meal, the company demonstrates a genuine commitment to employee happiness and success.\nFurthermore, the breakfast room becomes a vibrant hub of social interaction.

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: The Hang Seng Index (HSI) in Hong Kong has shown a strong recovery and steady growth over the past six months. This positive trend has been largely driven by increased investment from Mainland China, which has significantly boosted the market.\n\nA key factor in this growth has been the remarkable performance of the Properties and Utilities sub-indices, which have risen sharply.

Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Media has evolved dramatically over the past few decades, and its impact on society has shifted in several key ways:\n\nDigital Revolution: With the rise of the internet, social media, and mobile devices, traditional forms of media like newspapers, TV, and radio have had to adapt. Digital platforms, such as YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok, now dominate the media landscape, offering more interactive, personalized, and instantaneous content.\n\nSocial Media's Influence: Social media has blurred the lines between producer and consumer. Anyone with an internet connection can create content, which has shifted the power dynamic from traditional media outlets (like TV stations and news organizations) to individuals. Social media platforms also allow for instant feedback, creating more of a two-way conversation than the one-directional communication of past media.\n\nShift to On-Demand Content: In the past, people had to watch TV shows or movies according to a set schedule. Now, streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ allow for binge-watching and instant access to content anytime, anywhere, fundamentally changing how we consume entertainment.\n\nCitizen Journalism: With smartphones and social media, ordinary people can document and report events in real time, sometimes bypassing traditional news organizations. This has democratized information, but it has also led to challenges in terms of misinformation and the verification of sources.\n\n", "task_id": "7e0827d0-955c-484a-8c4f-81fe6a574af8", "ef_level": 11.0, "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The whole idea of celebrity culture often deserves criticism for being excessively superficial and occasionally misleading. One major drawback is the obsession with appearances and wealth, which can promote unrealistic standards and encourage materialism. It’s fair to say that this culture tends to exaggerate success while glossing over effort, failure, or genuine character development. Moreover, celebrities are frequently praised for simply being visible, rather than for meaningful contributions or expertise.\nTake social media influencers, for example. While some bring creativity and positive influence, others have been rightly criticized for spreading misinformation or promoting unhealthy lifestyles. It seems increasingly common for fame to be valued over substance. This can be damaging, particularly to impressionable audiences who may view celebrity status as the ultimate achievement, regardless of how it's attained.\nWhile I acknowledge that some celebrities use their platform responsibly, it’s hard to ignore the fact that the system itself encourages narcissism and prioritizes visibility over integrity.

Write the **strategic summary** and **risk assessment** sections of the proposal using the notes. Write 140–200 words. [SEP] Response: **Strategic Summary:**\n\nWe have identified a promising niche in the hotel market that caters specifically to eco-conscious travelers seeking sustainable and luxury accommodations. The market for eco-friendly tourism is growing rapidly, driven by increased awareness of environmental impact and a shift toward responsible travel. Our hotel concept, \"EcoLux Retreats,\" will offer a unique combination of luxury experiences and sustainable practices, including energy-efficient facilities, waste reduction systems, and locally sourced materials. The target demographic includes high-net-worth individuals and business travelers who value both sustainability and comfort. By capitalizing on this emerging trend, EcoLux Retreats aims to capture market share in regions with high tourism demand, starting with key locations in environmentally conscious destinations.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n\nAs with any new venture, there are risks to consider. The primary risk involves the initial capital investment required to build eco-friendly infrastructure, which could lead to delayed returns if market demand does not meet projections. Additionally, fluctuations in the economy or a downturn in the luxury tourism sector could impact profitability. Regulatory risks related to environmental standards and compliance requirements could also pose challenges. Finally, competition from established hotel brands adopting eco-friendly practices may create market pressure. To mitigate these risks, we will employ robust market research, secure strategic partnerships, and ensure a scalable business model.", "task_id": "0efc8863-e086-4c4a-aa14-7f688dec4cb3", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 5}

Include an introduction, a body (with signposting phrases, where possible), an anecdote and a call to action. Write 150–250 words. [SEP] Response: Good morning everyone, and welcome to Frisko Shipping!\n\nI’m excited to have the opportunity to introduce you to our company today. I know you’ve all come here with great enthusiasm and a desire to be part of something special, and I can promise you, Frisko Shipping is exactly that. But don’t just take my word for it—let’s dive into the story behind our global success and see why you’re joining a team that’s truly exceptional.\n\nLet me begin with a brief history.\nFrisko Shipping was founded in 2001 by Bill Frisko, a visionary with a passion for global trade. What started as a small shipping company has now grown into a powerhouse with locations in 20 cities across the world. With over 5,000 employees, we’ve built an international network that moves millions of goods every day, connecting markets and communities in ways that many companies only dream of.\n\nLast year, we achieved a profit of 5 million dollars and captured 10% of the global market. It’s an impressive track record, and it reflects the dedication of every person who has worked here—and now, that includes you!\n\nBut it’s not just about the numbers. We believe that people are at the heart of everything we do. We want you to bring your enthusiasm, your motivation, and your drive to the table. New employees like you are expected to bring fresh ideas and energy into the company, and in return, we promise you’ll be part of a company that values growth, creativity, and a strong sense of teamwork.\n\nNow, let me share an anecdote about Bill Frisko himself.\nMany of you may already know that Bill’s journey to founding Frisko Shipping wasn’t a typical one. In fact, it was an experience that could’ve been the end of his career. On one of his early adventures, Bill fell into the ocean and was bitten by a shark. But rather than letting this life-changing moment defeat him, Bill saw it as a sign to make a change. In fact, the very ship that rescued him became the inspiration for the birth of Frisko Shipping. Bill often says that you can find inspiration in the most unexpected places—even in the middle of a life-threatening situation. And that’s the kind of mindset we value here. Anything can happen, and with the right perspective, it can lead to incredible opportunities.\n\nBefore I finish, I want to make sure you’re thinking ahead—not just about what Frisko Shipping is today, but about what we can become together. So, here’s a little challenge for you: How much do you really know about the company you’ve just joined? I’d like to kick things off with a fun quiz to see how many facts you’ve already picked up. It’s a great way to test your knowledge and get you even more excited about being a part of our journey.\n\nIn conclusion, as you step into your new roles, remember that you’re not just joining a company—you’re joining a movement. A movement that began with a spark of inspiration and has grown into something truly global. So, let’s work together, think outside the box, and continue to build on the foundation of success that we’ve all worked so hard to create.\n\nWelcome aboard, and let’s get started!", "task_id": "5c89b5ef-f9e4-44c0-bd77-31ed1d856ff0", "ef_level": 11.0, "label": 5}

It also leads to overdose deaths, addiction, and other health problems.\n3. *Social and Economic Instability:* The illegal drug trade undermines communities, fuels corruption, and diverts resources away from essential public services.

The Curupira appears as a small man with bright red hair and, most notably, backward-facing feet. His reversed feet serve to confuse hunters and intruders, making it nearly impossible to track him through the forest.\n\nThe Curupira is believed to punish those who harm animals unnecessarily or destroy nature. He uses illusions, tricks, and eerie sounds to scare away poachers or anyone who disrespects the forest. Some say he can disappear in an instant or run at incredible speeds, making him nearly impossible to catch.\n\nThis creature is widely known throughout Brazil, especially in the Amazon region. His legend is still taught to children today, often as a way to promote respect for nature. I find the Curupira interesting not only for his magical qualities but also for the environmental message behind his story. In many ways, he symbolizes a deep connection between people and nature.\n\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Here are some key strategies that can help you lead with confidence.\n\nFirst, build trust by being transparent and approachable. When employees feel heard and respected, they’re more likely to stay engaged. Set clear expectations and provide regular, constructive feedback. Recognize achievements both big and small — this shows your team their efforts are valued.\n\nOffer opportunities for growth, such as training or mentorship programs. People are more motivated when they see a future within the company. Also, promote a healthy work-life balance; a burned-out team is an unproductive one.\n\nNow, some strategies to avoid: never take credit for your team's work — always give credit where it’s due. Avoid micromanaging, as it kills creativity and confidence. Don’t ignore problems or complaints; doing so can lead to resentment. And finally, never let disrespect or unfair treatment go unaddressed.\n\nWith empathy, fairness, and strong communication, you’ll create a team that feels inspired and supported.\n\nBest of luck!\n[Your Name]\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 0}

Companies benefit from the resources, labor, and infrastructure provided by these communities, and, in return, they have a moral obligation to contribute positively to societal well-being. Moreover, as Jack@MSU highlighted, CSR can enhance a company's reputation and foster customer loyalty, ultimately benefiting the bottom line. Consumers today are increasingly aware of and concerned about the ethical practices of the companies they support, making CSR not just a moral choice but a strategic business decision.\n\nOn the other hand, critics like theG8T remind us of Milton Friedman's view that a corporation's primary responsibility is to its shareholders. While profit is undoubtedly a key driver of business success, this perspective can be too narrow, especially in an era where social and environmental challenges are pressing. JackD_92 points out that CSR efforts are sometimes perceived as mere marketing strategies rather than genuine contributions, which can undermine their effectiveness and authenticity.\n\nA middle ground can be found by recognizing that businesses can pursue profit while also addressing societal needs. This is not only feasible but often beneficial in the long term. Companies that integrate CSR into their core operations can innovate, improve risk management, and create a sustainable competitive advantage. It's also important to note, as patty925 suggests, that governments play a crucial role in setting the regulatory framework within which businesses operate. Effective regulation can guide and incentivize companies to act in socially responsible ways without usurping the role of businesses in driving innovation and economic growth.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

Being a doctor is a wonderful satisfying profession which needs intellectual and analyzing skills as well as interpersonal skills like empathy and a kind of feeling for social matters. \nMedical training requires perseverance and diligence but offers a lot of possibilities to work in. You normally start working in a hospital and will be able to develop own practical skills. You will be responsible for patient care, developing individualized treatment plans, overseeing the course of therapy, and educating patients about procedures, diagnoses, medication adherence, and further therapeutic steps. Earnings depend on your qualification and type of hospital but I believe it`s enough to make a good living. With more clinical experience you'll get higher paid positions and maybe you will have the opportunity to earn extra salary with lectures (when you're involved in research and in political positions). Generally, you can work as a general practitioner or any kind of specialist in your own praxis which requires also entrepreneurial skills.\nTo conclude, being a doctor is a wonderful to help patients, to work with diverse groups of people and to engage in lifelong learning and personal development.

The most famous Naga is Shesha, the king of all Nagas, who serves as the bed for Lord Vishnu, one of the principal deities in Hinduism. Shesha is depicted with multiple heads, each symbolizing his vast knowledge and power.\n\nIn various myths, Nagas interact with humans, sometimes marrying them or bestowing blessings upon them. They are also associated with the protection of sacred texts and temples.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words.

Focus on Fame and Wealth:\nCelebrities often prioritize fame and wealth, which can be a negative influence on young people who may then focus on these things instead of more important values.\n2. Promote Unrealistic Standards:\nCelebrities often promote unrealistic beauty and lifestyle standards that can lead to body image issues and dissatisfaction.\n3. Normalizing Unhealthy Behaviors:\nSome celebrities normalize unhealthy habits like substance abuse, unhealthy eating, and risky behaviors, which can be harmful to young people.\n4. Lack of Accountability:\nCelebrities often face less scrutiny and accountability for their actions than regular people, which can lead to them making poor choices without consequences.\n5. Controversies and Scandals:\nCelebrities are often involved in controversies and scandals, which can damage their image and negatively impact young people who look up to them.\n6. Attention Seeking Disorder:\nSome celebrities may get involved in controversies to be in the media, which can be a negative influence on young people who may try to do the same.\n7. Unrealistic Expectations:\nYoung people may have unrealistic expectations of themselves and their lives based on what they see celebrities doing, which can lead to disappointment and frustration.\n8. Narcissistic Tendencies:\nStudies suggest that some celebrities exhibit narcissistic tendencies, which can be a negative influence on young people who may try to emulate these behaviors.\n9. Lack of Diversity:\nThe focus on a small group of celebrities can lead to a lack of diversity and representation, which can be harmful to young people who may not see themselves reflected in these role models.\n10. They are not perfect:\nCelebrities are also regular human beings who make mistakes and have weaknesses just like we do.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 4}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home in India is a significant emotional and financial milestone for most, but it can also be a very complex process. Prospective homeowners typically begin by evaluating their budget and determining the type of property they want, whether it's an apartment in a bustling city or a house in a quieter suburb. Housing prices vary significantly depending on the location, size, and amenities of the property. Major metropolitan cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore often have high real estate prices due to demand and limited space.\n\nSecuring a home loan in India involves several steps, and while it can be daunting, it's manageable with preparation. The process includes researching various banks and financial institutions to compare interest rates, which generally range from 6.5% to 9% as of the latest data. Applicants must submit a variety of documents, including proof of identity, income, and property details. The paperwork can be extensive, but most institutions offer guidance to streamline the process.\n\nWhile not mandatory, using a real estate agent can be beneficial for navigating property options and negotiations. Similarly, a mortgage broker can assist in finding favorable loan terms and handling the paperwork. Ultimately, while the process can be challenging due to the documentation and financial commitments involved, thorough research and professional assistance can simplify the journey of buying a home in India.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan in my country can be both exciting and challenging, depending on one's financial situation and the property market at the time. The process itself involves multiple steps, starting with determining the budget, finding a suitable property, and applying for a loan. Housing prices vary greatly depending on the location, with urban areas being significantly more expensive than rural areas. In general, housing can be quite expensive, especially in major cities, where demand is high, and supply is limited. Applying for a home loan involves submitting a range of documents to the bank or lending institution. While the application process is relatively straightforward, it can feel daunting due to the numerous forms that need to be completed. Lenders usually require proof of income, tax returns, and other financial documents, along with a credit history check. The loan approval process can take several weeks, and the terms of the loan depend on factors like credit score and down payment. Interest rates can vary, but they tend to range from 3% to 7%, depending on the type of loan and the borrower's financial profile. While it's not mandatory, many people choose to work with a real estate agent or mortgage broker to help navigate the complexities of the housing market and secure the best loan terms. These professionals can assist with negotiations and paperwork, making the process smoother. Despite the challenges, with the right preparation and guidance, buying a home can be an achievable goal.\n", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Developing leadership qualities is a continuous journey that mixes self-awareness, practice, and adaptability. From personal experience, stepping into leadership roles, whether in group projects or professional settings, taught me that communication, empathy, and resilience are foundational. A leader must articulate a clear vision while actively listening to the perspectives from others, fostering trust and collaboration. Empathy to connect with team members, understand their challenges, and inspire motivation. Resilience to adapt and learn, surviving the inevitable setbacks, defining the leadership impact.\n\nObserving others, I’ve noticed that the best leaders lead by example. They don’t weakness in front of hard work, admit mistakes openly, and prioritize team growth over personal glory. Confidence without arrogance, decisiveness balanced with humility, and a growth mindset are traits that stand out.\n\nWhile not everyone aspires to lead, everyone has the potential to cultivate leadership qualities. It begins with taking initiative, embracing responsibility, and seeking feedback. Leadership isn’t about titles, it’s about influence and action. Even small acts of mentorship, problem-solving, or rallying others toward a shared goal reflect leadership. With intentional effort, anyone can hone these skills and inspire positive change, regardless of their natural inclinations.", "task_id": "ce3f3898-f2a7-4978-8f4f-17596f229f1d", "ef_level": 12.0, "label": 5}

Be sure to polish your work before you submit it. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: **Comparison-Contrast Essay: New York City vs. Tokyo**\n\nNew York City and Tokyo are two of the world’s most iconic cities, each representing its own unique culture and lifestyle. **New York City** is known for its vibrant energy, diverse population, and iconic landmarks like Times Square and Central Park. The city offers an eclectic blend of cultures, with each neighborhood reflecting the diversity of its residents. The fast-paced environment, constant activity, and strong emphasis on individualism define the city's character.\n\nIn contrast, **Tokyo** offers a more orderly and efficient atmosphere, with a seamless blend of modernity and tradition. The city is known for its advanced technology, immaculate public transport system, and respect for hierarchy and etiquette. While it has its share of bustling areas like Shibuya and Shinjuku, Tokyo often feels more structured and controlled compared to the spontaneous energy of New York City. Tokyo also places a strong emphasis on harmony and collective well-being, as seen in its quieter, more reserved public spaces.\n\nIn conclusion, while both cities offer dynamic urban experiences, New York City's chaotic, individualistic spirit contrasts with Tokyo's disciplined, harmonious vibe. Each city appeals to different sensibilities, yet both offer an unmatched sense of life and excitement.\n", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility should be an integral part of every company's activity. As they grow, companies must contribute to the growth of the communities and environment they are evolving in by assisting them in some aspects in which they are struggling (education, health, sport etc.). \n\nAlthough opinions are different concerning CSR, even if publicity is the motivation or even if it is too expensive and it can't reach everyone, at least it can change some people's lives. Companies must bring added-value to the communities that host them. They must think beyond financial benefits and aim to improve individuals' lives. CSR has also positive returns for their employees as they will feel more valued and useful. Moreover, CSR actions have positive impact on the productivities of companies. It's win-win. \n\nFinally, every individual, every, foundation, every community should contribute to the social development of the most disadvantaged people because Governments do not have enough means to reach all the populations.

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The free writing technique is a valuable tool for developing creativity, overcoming writers block and enhancing flow of ideas. By allowing writers to write continuously without worrying about grammar, punctuation, or structure, free writing encourages the mind to explore thoughts freely and organically. This process often leads to unexpected insights, new perspectives, and original ideas that might not emerge under more restrictive writing conditions. It removes the fear of making mistakes and helps silence the inner critic, which can often hinder the creative process.\nMoreover, free writing serves as a warm-up exercise that gets the brain engaged before starting more structured writing tasks. It helps writers discover their voice and develop confidence in their expression. For students and professionals alike, it can be particularly useful in brainstorming, drafting, or simply breaking through periods of mental stagnation. By cultivating a habit of free writing, individuals can improve their overall writing fluency. Overall, the technique supports both personal expressions and skill development, making it a powerful tool for writers of all levels.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find focused free writing and questioning the most useful. Focused free writing allows me to channel my thoughts in a structured yet creative way. By concentrating on a single topic, I can delve deeper into my ideas without the distraction of unrelated tangents. This technique helps me overcome writer’s block and often leads to unexpected insights that improve the depth of my work. It’s especially effective when exploring complex subjects or drafting the initial stages of an essay.\n\nOn the other hand, questioning is a technique that encourages curiosity and critical thinking. By asking \"why,\" \"how,\" and \"what if\" questions, I can examine a topic from multiple perspectives, uncovering hidden layers of meaning. This method enhances my analytical skills and ensures that my writing addresses potential questions a reader might have, making it more engaging and comprehensive.\n\nThese techniques complement each other well; focused free writing generates raw ideas, while questioning refines and organizes them into coherent, impactful content. Together, they form a powerful foundation for my creative and academic writing processes.\n", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: NAFTA - the North America Free Trade Agreement - is a free trade agreement between the three biggest countries of the Northern part of America. To be more specific, the member states are the USA, Canada and Mexico and after years of long and difficult negotiations the agreement came into force in January 1994.\n\nThe agreement can be seen as a kind of expansion of the already existing bilateral agreement between the USA and Canada which facilitated trade and reduced customs duties among the members and eliminated them respectively. It has had a profound effect on the trade relations, especially in agriculture (e.g. dairy, fruits, grains), but also in the car or steel industries.\n\nUnlike the European Union, NAFTA did not perform supranational government functions, nor did its provisions take precedence over national law.\n\nToday, after more than 30 years of its conclusion, it can be noticed that there has been both, positive and negative, impacts on all three members, but overall each of them has been benefitting from it.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

The acoustic instrumentation gives it a warm, earthy feel, while the lyrics reflect on the transformation of a once-familiar place into something unrecognizable. The song’s message is deeply relatable, touching on themes of progress versus preservation, and the emotional weight of watching a home and community evolve beyond recognition. The chorus is particularly striking, questioning whether all change is truly an improvement.

The Naga are serpent-like beings that hold a significant place in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions. They are often depicted as half-human, half-snake, with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a serpent. In some stories, they can also take on a fully human or fully serpent form.\n\nNagas are believed to reside in the underworld, known as Patala, and are considered guardians of treasures and water bodies like rivers, lakes, and seas. They are revered for their wisdom and power but can also be fearsome when provoked. In Hindu mythology, the Naga king, Shesha, is said to hold the universe on his thousand heads, while another famous Naga, Vasuki, serves as a churning rope in the myth of the churning of the ocean.\n\nThese creatures are often associated with fertility and prosperity, and their blessings are sought for good harvests and protection from snake bites.

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find focused free writing, questioning, and metaphor to be the most useful. Focused free writing helps me explore a specific idea without the pressure of perfection, allowing creativity to flow while still maintaining direction. It’s especially helpful when I’m stuck or unsure how to begin a piece, as it encourages momentum and clarity.\nQuestioning is another powerful technique because it pushes me to think critically and deeply about my topic. By asking who, what, when, where, why, and how, I can uncover new angles and insights that enrich my writing. It also helps in organizing my thoughts and structuring my arguments more effectively.\nLastly, metaphor adds depth and vividness to my writing. It allows abstract or complex ideas to be conveyed in a relatable and imaginative way, making the content more engaging for readers. When used well, metaphors can leave a lasting impression and enhance the emotional impact of a piece.\nWould you like help turning this into a polished assignment or adding examples for each technique?", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

The flight, which had departed from Oakland, California, was en route to Phoenix, Arizona, when the crew noticed a fault message for the nose landing gear shock absorber. After a flyby confirmed the nose gear issue, the captain diverted to San Francisco for its better emergency support and longer runway. The crew burned fuel to reduce landing weight and prepared passengers for a potential emergency. The captain executed a controlled landing, keeping the nose gear off the ground as long as possible.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home in India involves a series of steps, beginning with determining your budget and preferred location. Housing prices vary significantly across cities; for instance, in 2023, prices in Mumbai or Delhi are higher compared to cities like Pune or Bangalore. Typically, residential property prices in prime areas range from ₹10,000 to ₹30,000 per square foot, while suburban areas may offer more affordable options.\n\nOnce a property is chosen, applying for a home loan is a common step. The loan application process involves submitting documents such as identity proof, income proof, and property details. Banks assess eligibility based on credit score, income, and repayment capacity. Home loan interest rates in India fluctuate between 6.5% to 9%, influenced by economic conditions and RBI policies.\n\nReal estate brokers play a crucial role in navigating the property market. They provide expertise in finding suitable properties, negotiating prices, and handling paperwork. Brokers charge a commission, typically 1-2% of the property's sale price, which can vary depending on the region and the services offered.\n\nIn summary, buying a home in India requires careful planning, from understanding market prices to securing a home loan. Engaging with a broker can simplify the process, though it adds to the overall cost. Prospective buyers must consider current interest rates and market trends to make informed decisions.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: In today's media-driven world, celebrities often use their platforms to promote charitable causes, but sometimes their motives can be questioned. When a celebrity incessantly highlights their charitable efforts, it can appear less about the cause and more about self-promotion. This constant self-congratulatory narrative may overshadow the actual issues at hand, shifting focus from those in need to the celebrity's image. True philanthropy should prioritize the cause over personal gain, aiming to inspire rather than seeking applause. While raising awareness is valuable, authenticity matters. Actions speak louder than words, and genuine commitment often resonates more when done quietly. Excessive self-promotion can lead to public skepticism, diminishing the perceived sincerity of the charitable act. It is crucial for celebrities to strike a balance between using their influence for good and ensuring their efforts reflect genuine concern, not just a strategy to enhance their popularity.

The market is characterized by complex national regulations and consolidation among the largest international groups.

The company was formed in 2000 through the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham.

[SEP] Response: Last weekend, my friend Emma had one of those adventures you only hear about in books. She was at a local flea market when an old, dusty box caught her eye. Inside, she found a faded leather pouch with intricate designs on the edges. Curious, she opened it and found an ancient-looking map. The paper was brittle, and the ink had smudged in places, but there was no mistaking the symbol of a compass in the corner—a symbol she'd seen before in her grandmother's stories about treasure hunts.\n\nIntrigued, Emma showed it to me, and we started to piece together the strange markings. They seemed to point toward a hidden location in a nearby park. Naturally, we had to investigate. Armed with only the map, a flashlight, and some snacks, we ventured out at dusk. As we neared the marked spot, we found an old stone bench under a giant oak tree. Beneath it, buried under a pile of leaves, was a small, rusty tin box. Inside? A collection of vintage coins from the 1800s.\n\nIt was the kind of discovery that felt like magic, and Emma’s face was priceless when she realized she'd just unlocked a piece of history.", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

As dusk settled over the water, she decided to release a sky lantern—a tradition she had picked up during her travels.\n\nShe lit the lantern, watched it rise, and then suddenly... it vanished. Not just faded into the night sky—completely gone, as if it had been snatched by an invisible hand.\n\nStartled but curious, Mia lit another lantern. This one drifted upwards, but halfway to the clouds, it flickered out and disappeared too. By the time the third lantern vanished, Mia was convinced something eerie was going on.\n\nWhen she mentioned it to her neighbor, they told her about the legend of \"The Whispering Wind,\" a local tale of a spirit that guards the skies above the lake. It’s said to collect lanterns as offerings to light its realm.\n\nMia isn’t one to believe in ghosts, but she admits there was something oddly magical about that night.

Reasons for dissatisfaction included concerns with design, size, color, and material.\n\nConclusions: Collarless dress shirts have limited appeal in Rio, largely due to design and fit issues, while they were moderately well-received in Shanghai. Both regions suggested that the product may benefit from additional market research to meet consumer expectations.\n\nRecommendations: To improve appeal, we suggest additional research on regional preferences, adjusting designs with slimmer fits, adding color options (e.g., strong primary colors, black, white), and using materials with practical qualities like wrinkle resistance and sweat absorption.

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: The stock market index is a statistical measure that reflects the composite value of a selected group of stocks. These indexes serve as benchmarks for evaluating the performance of individual stocks, sectors, or the market as a whole. Prominent examples include the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and NASDAQ Composite in the United States. Each index has its own methodology for selecting and weighting its components, which can be based on market capitalization, price, or other factors.\n\nInvestors and analysts use stock market indexes to gauge market trends, compare investment portfolios, and inform trading strategies. For example, a rise in the S&P 500 is often interpreted as a sign of overall economic health, while a decline might signal economic challenges. Indexes also underpin various financial products like mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), allowing investors to gain diversified exposure to the market.\n\nMoreover, indexes can be sector-specific, focusing on industries such as technology, healthcare, or energy. This allows for targeted investment strategies and performance analysis within specific areas of the economy. Overall, stock market indexes play a crucial role in the financial ecosystem.", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: Among the writing techniques introduced, **focused free writing** and **questioning** stand out as particularly useful to me.

By asking questions about what, why, and how, I can challenge assumptions and explore the subject from different perspectives. This technique encourages a more thorough examination of ideas and often leads to more insightful writing.\n\nBoth techniques help me in the initial stages of writing, allowing me to refine my thoughts and develop a clearer direction.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, the ones I find most useful are free writing, focused free writing, and questioning. Free writing, in particular, helps me break through writer’s block and silence my inner critic. When I allow myself to write freely without worrying about grammar, structure, or coherence, I’m often surprised by the ideas that emerge. It’s a technique that helps me uncover thoughts and emotions I might not realize I had, which can later be shaped into meaningful writing. Focused free writing builds on this freedom but gives it a sense of purpose. By concentrating on a specific topic, I can channel my creative flow in a more organized direction. This technique is especially helpful when I have a general idea but need to develop it more deeply and clearly.\n\nQuestioning is another technique I’ve found to be incredibly effective. By asking myself targeted questions—such as who is affected by this topic, what is the core message, why does it matter—I’m able to think critically and explore various perspectives. This not only helps with content development but also with identifying gaps in my understanding. These three techniques, when used together, create a strong foundation for both academic and personal writing. They help me move from brainstorming to refining my ideas in a structured and thoughtful way.\n", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: In today’s business landscape, many companies prioritize maximizing short-term profits, often at the expense of employee well-being. The prevailing notion is that by focusing on immediate financial gains, businesses can sustain high levels of revenue and growth. However, this short-term focus has significant downsides, including high employee turnover, burnout, and decreased productivity, which, paradoxically, reduce profitability over time.\n\nA healthier and more sustainable approach would be to prioritize employee well-being as a core business strategy. Investing in employee satisfaction through comprehensive wellness programs, flexible work arrangements, and opportunities for professional growth can yield better long-term results. Studies show that companies with a strong focus on employee well-being tend to have more engaged workers, lower turnover rates, and, ultimately, higher productivity and profitability.\n\nFor example, implementing a flexible work model allows employees to balance their professional and personal lives better, leading to increased satisfaction and productivity. When employees feel valued and supported, they are more likely to stay with the company, reducing the costs associated with recruitment and training. This approach also fosters a positive workplace culture that can enhance the company’s reputation, attracting top talent and reducing recruitment challenges.\n\nFurthermore, wellness programs that focus on mental and physical health create a resilient workforce, reducing absenteeism and healthcare costs. Companies that implement such programs report higher engagement and loyalty from their employees, which contributes directly to sustained financial success.\n\nIn conclusion, shifting focus from short-term profits to a people-centered approach offers numerous benefits. Instead of treating employees as mere resources, companies should see them as integral to long-term success. A balanced approach that values employee well-being not only enhances productivity but also ensures the company’s longevity and resilience in a competitive market.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

Alberta’s oil sands hold extensive bitumen reserves, presenting significant potential for long-term extraction and processing.\n\nOperational costs range from $6 to $14 per barrel for raw bitumen, and $18 to $22 per barrel for synthetic crude. Supply costs are slightly higher, estimated at $14 to $24 per barrel for bitumen and $36 to $40 for synthetic crude. These figures suggest that profitability is sensitive to global crude prices.\n\nProduction levels are projected to rise significantly, reaching 3.9 million barrels per day by 2015. This increase signals the need for both the expansion of traditional markets and the development of new distribution channels.\n\nConclusion: Alberta’s oil sands are a promising source of oil, but require strategic planning.\n\nRecommendations: Continue to monitor global crude oil prices, gather more localized data, assess labor transportation costs, and initiate pilot testing to confirm economic viability.", "task_id": "b99c403f-3a8e-4397-a157-2644d1952584", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The introduction of robots in society can have both positive and negative impacts. On the positive side, robots can significantly enhance productivity and efficiency across various sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics. They can undertake repetitive, dangerous, or labor-intensive tasks, reducing human error and freeing up workers for more complex roles. In healthcare, robots assist in surgeries and patient care, improving precision and outcomes. Additionally, robots can contribute to economic growth by driving innovation and creating new industries.\n\nOn the negative side, the increased use of robots may lead to job displacement, particularly for low-skilled workers, potentially exacerbating unemployment and income inequality. This technological shift requires workers to adapt and acquire new skills, which can be challenging for some. Ethical concerns also arise regarding privacy and the potential misuse of autonomous robots.\n\nOverall, the societal impact of robots depends on how effectively the transition is managed, including policies for retraining workers and addressing ethical considerations.", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 13.0 [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: In today’s interconnected world, I firmly believe that companies have responsibilities beyond just maximizing shareholder value. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is not merely a philanthropic gesture—it’s an ethical obligation and a smart business strategy.\n\n✅ Companies operate within communities that provide infrastructure, labor, and markets. As lil@213 notes, it's a two-way street. Giving back through environmental sustainability, fair wages, and education initiatives creates goodwill and strengthens social fabric. When corporations nurture their surroundings, they foster a healthy ecosystem for long-term growth.\n\n📈 Moreover, CSR aligns with business interests. As Jack@MSU highlights, modern consumers are socially conscious. A strong CSR reputation builds trust, encourages loyalty, and often translates into stronger financial performance. In other words, doing good is good business.\n\n⚖️ Detractors argue, as theG8T does, that companies exist solely to serve shareholders. While it's true that profit is central, that profit must be sustainable. Ignoring environmental degradation, social inequality, or poor labor standards eventually risks legal penalties, public backlash, and talent loss.\n\n🤝 Ultimately, businesses are not isolated entities; they’re part of society. CSR is not about replacing government roles but complementing them. By acknowledging their wider responsibilities, companies can shape a more equitable future—one where both profit and progress go hand in hand.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Assessing the Potential for Oil Extraction in the Alberta Oil Fields\nIntroduction\n\nThis report provides an assessment of the potential for oil extraction in the Alberta oil fields, focusing on bitumen resources, costs, and production forecasts.\n\nFindings.\nAlberta’s oil sands hold significant bitumen reserves, offering substantial opportunities for oil extraction. Operating costs range from $6 to $14 per barrel for bitumen and $18 to $22 per barrel for synthetic crude, while supply costs are estimated at $14 to $24 per barrel for bitumen and $36 to $40 per barrel for synthetic crude. Production capacity is projected to grow to 3.9 million barrels per day by 2015. Expansions in traditional markets are expected, but new market development will also be necessary to accommodate increased output.\n\nConclusion.\nThe Alberta oil fields present significant potential for oil extraction, but growth hinges on efficient cost management and market expansion.\n\nRecommendations.\nWe recommend monitoring crude oil prices closely, acquiring additional data to refine cost estimates, assessing labor transportation costs to the region, and initiating testing to optimize operations and market alignment.", "task_id": "b99c403f-3a8e-4397-a157-2644d1952584", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find metaphor and free writing to be particularly useful. Metaphors are powerful tools that allow writers to convey complex ideas and emotions through vivid and relatable imagery. By comparing one thing to another, metaphors can make abstract concepts more tangible and engaging for readers. For instance, describing a challenging situation as \"an uphill battle\" immediately evokes a sense of struggle and perseverance.\n\nOn the other hand, free writing is an excellent technique for overcoming writer's block and generating creative ideas. By writing continuously without worrying about grammar or structure, free writing encourages the flow of thoughts and helps uncover hidden insights. This technique is especially useful during the brainstorming phase, as it allows writers to explore different angles and perspectives without self-censorship.\n\nCombining these techniques can enhance the writing process, making it both more expressive and productive. Metaphors add depth and richness to the content, while free writing fosters creativity and spontaneity. Together, they provide a balanced approach to crafting compelling and imaginative pieces.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Listen to their conversation and write a formal email based on what you hear. Type in the input box. Write 120–150 words. [SEP] Response: A business visit is an essential aspect of maintaining and developing professional relationships. It allows individuals or teams to meet face-to-face, exchange ideas, and strengthen connections with clients, partners, or suppliers. Such visits often involve discussions about current projects, future opportunities, and strategies for mutual growth.\n\nTypically, a business visit begins with a formal introduction, followed by a presentation or review of key points relevant to the purpose of the meeting. For example, if the visit is to a client, the agenda might include updates on product performance, feedback sessions, and proposals for new services. On the other hand, visiting a supplier could focus on quality checks, production capacity, and pricing negotiations.\n\nBeyond the formalities, business visits provide an excellent opportunity for cultural exchange, particularly when traveling internationally. Understanding local business etiquette, such as greetings, dining practices, and communication styles, is crucial for building trust and rapport.\n\nThe success of a business visit depends on thorough preparation and effective follow-up. Preparing agendas, gathering relevant documents, and confirming schedules in advance ensure the meeting runs smoothly. After the visit, sending a summary or thank-you email reinforces the connection and keeps the conversation going.\n\nIn conclusion, a well-organized business visit is a valuable tool for fostering collaboration and driving professional success.\n", "task_id": "acb2b026-d0ec-4165-ac6b-2102736d5e0b", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 0}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: The debate around Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a crucial one, and in my opinion, companies absolutely have a responsibility to society that extends beyond merely maximizing profits for shareholders. While some argue a company's sole duty is to its investors, this perspective feels increasingly outdated. Businesses don't operate in a vacuum; they exist within communities, utilize shared resources, and rely on a healthy society for their workforce and consumer base. This interdependency creates an ethical obligation to contribute positively to the broader good.\n\nBeyond ethical considerations, CSR makes undeniable business sense. Consumers increasingly value and reward companies with strong social and environmental records, fostering loyalty and enhancing brand reputation. Furthermore, a genuine commitment to fair employee benefits and sustainable operations often leads to higher productivity, lower turnover, and a more engaged workforce. While some might view CSR spending as a mere marketing tactic, truly integrated efforts build long-term value and resilience, far surpassing any fleeting PR gains.\n\nUltimately, while governments certainly set regulations, responsible companies go beyond minimum compliance, proactively addressing societal challenges. Integrating social and environmental responsibility into core operations isn't just about doing good; it's about building a more reputable, sustainable, and ultimately more profitable future for all stakeholders involved.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Taking a home loan in India is a common way for individuals to finance the purchase of residential property. While the process has become more streamlined over the years, it still comes with its share of challenges.\nFirstly, the approval process can be lengthy and requires thorough documentation. Applicants must provide proof of income, identity, residence, and property details. For salaried individuals, lenders assess job stability and credit history. Self-employed applicants may face more scrutiny due to fluctuating income patterns. A good credit score—typically above 750—is crucial for favorable terms.\nInterest rates on home loans in India generally range between 8% to 9.5% per annum, depending on the borrower’s profile, loan amount, tenure, and the lender’s policies. These rates can be either fixed or floating. Floating interest rates are linked to the repo rate set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and can change over time, affecting EMI payments.\nOne major challenge is the burden of long-term financial commitment, as most home loans extend over 15 to 30 years. Additionally, the hidden costs like processing fees, legal charges, and insurance may increase the overall expense. Delays in property possession or legal disputes can also affect loan disbursement and repayment planning.\nDespite these hurdles, home loans remain a viable option for middle-class Indians aspiring to own a house. With proper planning, comparing loan offers, and maintaining a healthy credit profile, borrowers can navigate the challenges and secure a suitable home loan.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language students face a variety of issues and challenges that can hinder their learning progress. One of the primary obstacles is the difficulty of mastering pronunciation and grammar, especially when these differ significantly from their native language. This can lead to frustration and self-doubt, making it harder for students to stay motivated. Additionally, the lack of regular practice opportunities outside the classroom can result in limited language retention and fluency.\n\nCultural differences also pose a challenge, as understanding idiomatic expressions, social norms, and context-dependent meanings often requires more than just linguistic knowledge. These subtleties can make effective communication feel daunting for learners. Furthermore, language students may encounter a fear of making mistakes, which discourages them from speaking or participating actively.\n\nAccess to resources is another issue, as not all students have equal opportunities to engage with native speakers, language software, or immersive environments. Overcoming these challenges requires patience, support, and consistent practice to build confidence and competence.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 4}

Determined to find out more, he later visited the local historical society, where he learned that the items likely belonged to a young couple who once lived nearby.\n\nFinding that box sparked a new passion in Alex—uncovering forgotten stories.

What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Leadership is a cornerstone of progress in all areas of life, from organizations to communities and even personal relationships. A good leader is someone who inspires, guides, and motivates others toward achieving common goals. Their personality is a harmonious blend of interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence, and strategic thinking. \nA good leader has the power to inspire others by creating a compelling vision for the future. They communicate this vision with passion and clarity, energizing their team and fostering a sense of purpose. For instance, a leader who aligns team goals with organizational values can motivate individuals to give their best. Inspiration is not about issuing orders but about igniting a shared belief in the potential of collective success.\n\nLeadership involves guiding others while allowing them the space to grow. Effective leaders strike a balance between providing direction and empowering their team members. They serve as mentors, offering support and constructive feedback, while also entrusting their team with responsibilities. This balance helps individuals develop their skills and confidence, contributing to the overall success of the group.\nA good leader is much more than someone in charge; they are an inspiration, a guide, and a motivator. By combining interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence, and strategic thinking, effective leaders create environments where individuals and teams can thrive. Leadership is not a static quality but an evolving journey, requiring continuous learning and self-reflection. Whether in the workplace, community, or family, everyone has the potential to embrace leadership roles and contribute to meaningful progress. Let us strive to be the kind of leaders who leave a positive and lasting legacy.", "task_id": "ce3f3898-f2a7-4978-8f4f-17596f229f1d", "ef_level": 12.0, "label": 5}

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language students often encounter a variety of issues and challenges that can impede their learning process. What are the most common difficulties they face, and how can these be addressed?\n\nFirstly, language learners frequently struggle with pronunciation and accents. The phonetic differences between their native language and the target language can lead to misunderstandings and communication barriers. This challenge can be mitigated through practice and exposure to native speakers, as well as utilizing language learning tools that focus on pronunciation.\n\nAnother significant issue is the complexity of grammar and syntax. Language students often find it difficult to grasp the rules and structures of a new language, which can be vastly different from their own. To overcome this, learners can benefit from structured lessons and exercises that incrementally build their understanding, alongside practical application in conversations and writing.\n\nVocabulary acquisition is also a hurdle, as memorizing and retaining new words can be overwhelming. Students can address this challenge by using mnemonic devices, engaging in immersive experiences, and employing spaced repetition techniques to reinforce memory.\n\nAdditionally, cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions pose challenges, as language is deeply intertwined with culture. Students may struggle to understand context or use language appropriately. Exposure to authentic materials such as films, books, and interactions with native speakers can help bridge this gap.\n\nFinally, motivation and confidence are crucial yet fragile elements. Language learning is a long-term commitment that requires perseverance. Encouragement from peers, setting achievable goals, and celebrating small victories can sustain motivation and boost confidence.\n\nIn summary, language students face numerous challenges, but with strategic approaches and consistent effort, these obstacles can be overcome, leading to successful language acquisition.", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, was a significant trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It came into force in January 1994 after years of negotiation. The agreement aimed to reduce or eliminate customs duties among the member states, facilitating freer trade across the continent.\n\nNAFTA has had a profound impact on trade relations, particularly in sectors like agriculture, where it enabled the flow of Mexican fruits and vegetables into the U.S. market. The agreement has resulted in both positive and negative effects for the member countries. While it has fostered economic integration and growth, increased trade, and provided access to a larger market, it also faced criticism for contributing to job losses in certain industries and regions due to shifts in production.\n\nDespite the challenges, NAFTA is generally seen as having benefited all three member countries by enhancing their economic ties and competitiveness. The trade agreement was eventually replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2020, which aimed to modernize and address some of the criticisms of NAFTA.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: The music industry and its world tours have a significant environmental downside that is often overlooked. Musicians and bands, while entertaining millions, are paradoxically contributing to the carbon overload of our planet, primarily through their extensive use of private jets for tours and personal travel. \n\nArtists like Taylor Swift are exemplifying the issue. Swift's \"Eras Tour,\" with estimates suggesting she flew over 43,688 kilometers, potentially emitting an approximate of 1,500 metric tons of CO2 just from her private jet travel alone. \n\nContrastingly, a regular car typically emits around 0.4 kilograms of CO2 per mile, while a plane can emit 40 kilograms per mile, making the environmental impact of a musician's tour seem colossal. Each private jet flight on Swift's tour, covering vast distances for each concert leg, has the potential to emit as much CO2 as thousands of cars would in the same distance. While Swift has claimed to offset her emissions by purchasing carbon credits, the efficacy and transparency of this claims still remain under scrutiny. This situation sparks a broader conversation about sustainability in the entertainment industry, urging musicians to reconsider their strategy or significantly invest in genuine carbon reduction strategies.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: GENERAL INFO\n\nProposal submitted to: NH HOTELS\nJob name: Zen, a 'boutique' hotel in the North Islands of the Netherlands\nProposed by: CB Innovation\nContact: Carmen Bernal, Creative Manager (carmen.bernal@CBInnovation.com) \n\nPROPOSAL \nCB Innovation proposes the development of a Boutique hotel in the North islands of the Netherlands where tourists and local citizens can spend the day in the spa or fitness center,  enjoy a healthy menu in the restaurants or spend the night in a Zen and relaxing environment. The total investment is $4 million. \nSTRATEGIC SUMMARY\nMarket research performed by Accomdata Group showed that we have found a niche in the market. It is shown that there is growing trend in weekend getaways to relaxing resorts with greater attention to healthy lifestyle. In addition to this the North Islands do not offer a option like this so it is a great business opportunity in this area. The North Islands are the perfect natural place to allocate a business like this. Besides, a survey realized by Accomdata showed the customer unsatisfaction about the cuisine quality in most fitness centers. In this regard, the construction of renowned restaurants that offers healthy menu with top chefs and fully equipped gyms and swimming pools with trained instructors are the perfect combination for this Boutique Hotel. \nWe estimate a construction time of two years and forecast estimated time for recouping investment of four years from opening and profit starting five years from opening. The return of investment must start the second year after opening and the projected profit per year of $1 million after the second year.  \nRISK ASSESSMENT\nWe have factored any possible economic downturn into the above figures. Our projected figures indicate that If the economy remains stable, the period required for recouping investment and realizing profits could be cut in half.\nWe have already engaged  Kudos Advertising Agency to plan an intensive media campaign to promote the project since the early beginning. \n", "task_id": "0efc8863-e086-4c4a-aa14-7f688dec4cb3", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 4}

[SEP] Response: Meet Ivana Petrovitch, a thirty-one-year-old librarian from Stockholm. She was single, and the only thing that Ivana loved more than her cats, Itsy and Bitsy, were spine-chilling murder mysteries.\n\nIvana Petrovitch's devotion to her books was a literal version of Stockholm Syndrome. She found herself captivated by the pages she adored, unable to leave the embrace of her beloved library and the story-filled nooks of Stockholm she called home. She often dreamed of the countryside, but the city held a tight grasp on her, whispering secrets that only Ivana could hear.\n\nIt was a late winter evening, and Ivana was trapped in melancholic memories of her past lover. She was all alone in the dusty old library, sipping cocoa that would often fog up her glasses. She took a long sigh, wiped her glasses and wore them again. Ivana noticed that someone had written her name on the frosted window.\n\nAs Ivana reaches the window and traces her name, she is zapped into a parallel dimension, where she meets her alter ego, a successful criminal detective. \"This can't be real; I must be dreaming,\" Ivana exhaled and pinched her shoulder to check how far off she had gotten from reality.\n\nThis wasn't just Ivana's reality; this was also the plot of her favorite book. As Ivana gets accustomed to her new reality, she and the detective solve a series of crimes eerily similar to the plots of Ivana's favorite books.\n\nMonths pass by, and Ivana and her alter ego find a groove - they become the most successful crime-investigating duo in the history of Stockholm. The excitement of hunting down notorious criminals subsides during the nighttime, and Ivana yearns for the warmth of her old friends back in her library.\n\nWistful wishing takes Ivana on a stroll down the block, where her library from the parallel universe is now replaced by a grocery store. She walks into the store and strolls by different aisles. She buys a handful of mint chocolates from the counter and a cup of steaming hot chocolate. \n\nAs Ivana approaches the windowpanes of the grocery store, she writes her name on the fogged-up glass. She takes a sip and closes her eyes. She opens her eyes and notices nothing is different around her. Ivana decides to leave the grocery store and go home. \n\nAs soon as she steps out of the store, Ivana notices that the architecture of the neighboring buildings has changed from the outside.

Surveys and interviews will be conducted in order to evaluate the amount of time people spend engaged in work and leisure activities. Research of this size and scope is both necessary and timely since no similar work has been conducted in many years.\n\nThe research will analyze trends in leisure time over recent decades in the United States to determine whether the average amount of leisure time is changing. The aim of this research is to answer the following questions:\n\nDoes the current generation work longer hours than the previous generation?\nHow much time do people engage in leisure activities, and how do they spend their leisure time?\nHow much do people value their leisure time?\nBy conducting surveys with employers and those employed, and comparing this data with existing statistics, we will attempt to highlight the trends in leisure and work commitments.\n\nResearch methodology will focus on using surveys, interviews, sampling, data analysis and analytical comparisons. Limitations to this research include a maximum of three months for conducting research and data analysis. Material for this research will originate from research carried out in the past, as well as readily accessible government data.\n\nThe ultimate aim of this research is to shed light on current leisure and employment patterns and to add to the overall body of academic literature in the field of leisure studies.", "task_id": "bf43a9ca-521f-4f13-bdbe-414077f8b33f", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

Instead, they prefer public transport, valuing the time to stay connected or productive during their commute—and it’s more sustainable too.\n2- Air Travel Cost-Cutting: Airlines continue to reduce costs, often at the passenger’s expense. The upside? A rise in budget airlines means cheaper options for travelers on a budget.\n3- The Rise of Space Tourism: While still a luxury only the super-rich can afford, space travel is no longer just science fiction.

It might just become mainstream in our lifetime.\nHere’s the link to the article: [Insert link]\nLet me know your thoughts after reading!\nBest,\nYour Best Friend Ibrahim", "task_id": "ff0155e4-a137-4a41-a7b2-ebeaf0213c72", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

It functions by defining various maritime zones, such as territorial seas (up to 12 nautical miles from shore, under a state's full sovereignty) and exclusive economic zones (EEZs) (up to 200 nautical miles, where a state has special rights over marine resources).\n\nUNCLOS also sets out rules for navigation, including innocent passage and transit passage through straits. It provides a framework for the protection and preservation of the marine environment, marine scientific research, and the exploitation of deep seabed resources. Importantly, it establishes mechanisms for the settlement of disputes concerning its interpretation and application.", "task_id": "e7943e9e-0f41-4fe5-bd2c-906f06a219b1", "ef_level": 11.0, "label": 5}

According to the myth, the Minotaur was born from the union of Pasiphae, the wife of King Minos, and a sacred bull sent by Poseidon. To contain the beast, King Minos ordered the construction of a labyrinth on the island of Crete, a maze so intricate that no one who entered it could ever escape.\n\nThe Minotaur dwelled within this labyrinth, and every year, Athens was required to send seven young men and seven young women as a tribute to be sacrificed to the creature. The story of the Minotaur’s eventual demise is a heroic one, as the Athenian prince Theseus volunteered to enter the labyrinth, guided by a thread given to him by Minos' daughter, Ariadne. Theseus defeated the Minotaur, ending the reign of terror it had cast over Crete.\n\nThe Minotaur represents both the primal, beastly nature within humanity and the complexity of human desires, making it one of the most enduring symbols in Greek mythology.\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Learning a new language can be both exciting and challenging. What are the most common obstacles students encounter, and how can they overcome them? One major challenge is fear of making mistakes. Many learners feel embarrassed when they pronounce words incorrectly or use the wrong grammar. This fear can prevent them from practicing, which slows down progress. How can students build confidence? Practice in a supportive environment is key. Joining language exchange groups or using language apps can provide low-pressure opportunities to speak.\n\nAnother issue is lack of exposure. How often do students hear the language outside the classroom? Limited exposure to native speakers or authentic content can make it difficult to develop listening and speaking skills. Watching movies, listening to music, and reading books in the target language can help.\n\nFinally, motivation can be hard to maintain. Why do some students lose interest? If progress feels slow or the material is not engaging, learners may give up. Setting clear goals and tracking progress can make a big difference. In summary, while learning a language comes with challenges like fear, lack of exposure, and motivation loss, students can overcome them through regular practice, immersive experiences, and staying motivated.\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) means that businesses take responsibility for the impact they have on society and the environment. This includes things like helping local communities, protecting the environment, and treating employees fairly. Many businesses today focus on CSR because it can improve their reputation, attract customers, and show that they care about more than just making money.\n\nOne reason CSR is important is that businesses should help solve problems like pollution, poverty, and inequality. For example, companies that use renewable energy or support education programs are helping the world in a positive way. This shows that they care about the future, not just profits.\n\nHowever, some people argue that some companies only pretend to care about these issues for marketing purposes. This is called “greenwashing,” and it happens when companies make themselves look better without really making a difference. To avoid this, CSR efforts need to be real and part of the company’s daily practices, not just a way to improve their image.\n\nIn conclusion, CSR should be a key part of a company’s goals. When businesses focus on giving back to society, they can build trust, grow their customer base, and succeed in the long run.", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

However, his career has not been without criticism. I don't want a bad-mouth but  his tendency to over-dramatize fouls during matches, which has often drawn ridicule from fans and analysts worldwide. This behavior can detract from his otherwise brilliant performances and tarnish his reputation as a serious athlete. Additionally, Neymar has faced criticism for inconsistency in his performances, particularly during crucial moments for both his club and the Brazilian national team. Injuries have also plagued his career, leading some to question his long-term reliability. Off the field, his lavish lifestyle and occasional controversies, including disputes with teammates and coaches, have raised concerns about his professionalism and focus on the game. While Neymar remains a global icon and one of the most skilled players of his generation, these criticisms highlight areas where he could refine his legacy and strengthen his contributions to the sport.\n\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 4}

Be sure to polish your work before you submit it. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Kindness is one of the most beautiful qualities a person can have. It involves showing care, compassion, and understanding to others, regardless of who they are or where they come from. In our daily lives, small acts of kindness can make a huge difference. For example, offering a smile to a stranger, helping a friend in need, or simply saying thank you can brighten someone's day and create a positive atmosphere around us.\n\nResearch shows that kindness not only benefits others but also improves our own well-being. When we are kind, our brains release feel-good chemicals like endorphins and oxytocin, which help reduce stress and increase happiness. This means that being kind is good for our mental health too! Moreover, kindness fosters stronger relationships and builds a sense of community. When people feel appreciated and supported, they are more likely to reciprocate kindness, creating a cycle of goodwill that can spread throughout neighborhoods, workplaces, and even entire cities.\n\nIn a world that sometimes feels divided or stressful, kindness acts as a bridge that connects us all. It reminds us that, despite our differences, we share a common humanity. So, let's make kindness a daily habit—whether through a kind word, a helping hand, or simply listening to someone in need. Small acts of kindness can change lives and make the world a better place for everyone.\n", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find **free writing** and **listing** to be the most useful for my personal writing process.

Whether I’m brainstorming ideas for an essay or planning out the structure of a story, lists give me a visual way to see all my points and prioritize them.

Governments lose tax revenue, impacting public services. Additionally, counterfeit goods can endanger consumers through poor-quality materials, electrical hazards, or harmful chemicals.\n\nSigns of a Fake\n\nTo spot counterfeit goods:\n\t•\tPrice: If it’s too good to be true, it probably is.\n\t•\tPackaging: Look for spelling errors, poor-quality printing, or missing labels.\n\t•\tSeller Reputation: Avoid unauthorized retailers or online platforms without verified credentials.\n\t•\tProduct Quality: Check for differences in materials, stitching, or performance.\n\nWhat to Do if You Discover Fake Goods\n\t•\tReport the Seller: Notify the platform, manufacturer, or authorities.\n\t•\tAvoid Purchases: Refuse to support counterfeit markets.\n\t•\tEducate Others: Spread awareness about the risks of counterfeit goods.\n\nBy understanding the dangers and identifying counterfeit products, consumers can make informed decisions and help combat this global issue.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Metaphor and hyperbole are compelling literary devices that enrich writing by adding depth and vividness. Metaphors create connections between seemingly unrelated concepts, offering fresh perspectives and insights. By saying \"time is a thief,\" for example, a metaphor vividly conveys the idea of time stealthily taking moments from our lives, evoking emotions and reflection beyond literal descriptions.\n\nHyperbole, on the other hand, employs deliberate exaggeration for emphasis or effect. It captures the intensity of feelings or situations, making them more relatable and engaging. Phrases like \"I'm so hungry I could eat a horse\" illustrate an extreme level of hunger, adding humor or drama to the narrative.    \n\nTogether, these devices stimulate imagination and emotional engagement, allowing writers to express complex ideas in a relatable and memorable way. They transform ordinary language, making it more dynamic and impactful, which captivates readers and invites them to explore deeper meanings. a metaphor vividly conveys the idea of time stealthily taking moments from our lives, evoking emotions and reflection beyond literal descriptions.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Last year, I and Diana, a friend of mine who’s a Spanish teacher, were invited to participate in a voluntary Catholic mission in the US. She decided to take the invite and quit her job, but I declined it. It takes a lot of courage and faith to leave Brazil with little money and lots of fears. \nAs she arrived there, she  was very well received by the church community. She got a nice room with such friendly roommates. Little did she know of the ventures she’d face, though.\nThe first hindrance was communication. She was fluent in Spanish but had poor English. But she got some useful survival lessons from her roommates. Another issue that made Diana rethink her decision to leave Brazil was the weather – she arrived in New York by Thanksgiving. Can you imagine how cold she felt? Once again, her mates helped her by sharing their winter clothes and buying her new ones. They even managed to find Diana a part-time job at a language school, so she could have her own money while staying there.

[SEP] Response: One legendary creature that has fascinated people for centuries is the Basilisk, a mythical beast rooted in European folklore, particularly popular in Italy during the Middle Ages. Often referred to as the \"King of Serpents,\" the Basilisk is typically described as a serpent or lizard with a crown-like crest on its head. According to legend, it is born from a serpent’s egg incubated by a rooster, a bizarre and unnatural origin that adds to its mystique.\n\nWhat makes the Basilisk especially terrifying is its supposed ability to kill with a single glance or even with its breath. Medieval texts claimed that its mere presence could wither plants and crack stones. Because of this, it was said that the only way to defeat a Basilisk was to show it its own reflection, causing it to perish from its deadly gaze.\n\nThe Basilisk symbolizes danger, death, and the consequences of unnatural creation. Though clearly mythical, it reflects the fears and superstitions of the time and continues to appear in modern literature and fantasy, including the Harry Potter series. Its enduring appeal lies in its blend of mystery, danger, and the eerie logic of ancient folklore.\n", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

It is very convenient for the restaurants because robot can carry foods safely and no mistakes. Also, they can make possible to reduce cost. Robots can work even midnight.

Be sure to polish your work before you submit it. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: My favorite city in Argentina is Buenos Aires, a bustling metropolis known for its European-style architecture, vibrant culture, and passionate tango dance. This dynamic city is contrasted sharply with the serene and awe-inspiring natural beauty of Patagonia. Buenos Aires, often referred to as the “Paris of South America,” is a city that never sleeps. Its streets are filled with lively cafes, historic theaters, and grand avenues. The neighborhoods, such as Palermo and San Telmo, each have their unique charm, offering a blend of old-world elegance and modern vibrancy.\n\nThen, there is Patagonia, a region located at the southern end of South America, shared by Argentina and Chile. Patagonia is renowned for its dramatic landscapes, including the towering Andes mountains, vast glaciers, and stunning national parks like Los Glaciares and Torres del Paine. Unlike the urban excitement of Buenos Aires, Patagonia offers a tranquil and remote experience where nature’s grandeur takes center stage.\n\nWhile Buenos Aires captivates with its rich cultural heritage, architectural beauty, and lively atmosphere, Patagonia enchants with its pristine wilderness, breathtaking scenery, and opportunities for adventure and exploration. Buenos Aires' charm lies in its ability to blend history, culture, and modernity seamlessly, creating a city that is both cosmopolitan and deeply rooted in tradition. In contrast, Patagonia’s allure is its untouched landscapes and the sense of peace and wonder they invoke. Together, these two destinations highlight the diverse experiences that Argentina has to offer, from the vibrant city life in Buenos Aires to the serene natural wonders of Patagonia.", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: The current situation of the Spanish real estate market is broadly characterised by the high demand for housing, especially new construction, and the shortage of supply. As a result of this mismatch between supply and demand, the price of housing continues to rise. The average price of new housing in Spain has reached €2,930/m² in June 2024, with large cities such as Barcelona (€5,262/m²) and Madrid (€4,493/m²) having the highest demand, the lowest supply and, consequently, the highest prices. All these factors, combined with the fact that the average salary in Spain is relatively low, around €2,200 gross per month, mean that most people have to apply for a bank loan to buy their home. \n\nIn Spain, you can buy a home through real estate agencies or from individual to individual. Buying a property from an individual offers personalised service and saves on commissions, while real estate agencies offer expert advice and speed up the paperwork. \n\nOnce you have found the perfect house, it is time to face the process of applying for a loan. The main requirements of banks when granting a mortgage have to do with the applicant's financial situation. In order to know the stability and good current and future financial solvency of the client, the bank asks for pay slips and work history, and checks that he or she has no other outstanding debts. \n\nA good tip when applying for a loan, is to compare different mortgage loan offers from different banking entities. During this process, you also have to decide which type of mortgage best fits your financial situation: \n- Fixed rate: the same installment and the same interest rate during the life of the mortgage. \n- Variable rate: the interest rate, and consequently the installment, vary depending on the reference index published by the banking entities, which is reviewed every 6 months. \n- Mixed rate: a fixed rate is applied during the first years of the loan and then a variable interest rate is applied.\n\nAnother aspect to take into account is the fees associated with the application and granting of the mortgage loan:\n- Opening fee: paid to the bank at the beginning of the loan for paperwork and management.\n- Account fee associated with the mortgage: opening an account, with associated fees, to manage the payment of the installments.\n\nIn addition, we must not forget that mortgages have a financing limit of up to 80% of the value of the property, as well as an amortization period ranging from 20 to 30 years. \n\nIn short, taking out a mortgage is a long process that requires taking time to carefully study the options and possibilities in order to obtain the best financing.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Apart from the problems of the ongoing conflicts, there has been the constant threat of hunger for the civilians in the area. Earlier in the year the weather was unusually cold and dry, which resulted in crop failures. In recent weeks heavy rains have caused flooding and the destruction of bridges, roads and rail links, cutting off some of the most vulnerable villages.\n\nAs a result of the conflict and because of humanitarian concerns, Chapter VII of the UN Charter was invoked by a special resolution with strong rules of engagement (ROE) to impose peace, separate the warring factions and provide humanitarian care.

After some analysis, the company introduced a mentorship program and performance-based bonuses. These changes helped increase employee satisfaction and reduced turnover within six months.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home and applying for a home loan can be a complex and demanding process in many countries. The process often involves multiple steps, including finding a suitable property, securing financing, and completing legal formalities. Housing prices can vary significantly depending on the region, with urban areas typically being more expensive than rural locations.\n\nApplying for a home loan generally requires filling out several forms and providing detailed documentation. Lenders typically ask for proof of income, tax returns, employment history, credit score details, and bank statements to assess the borrower’s financial stability. The process can feel overwhelming due to the volume of paperwork and the requirement for accuracy.\n\nInterest rates fluctuate based on economic conditions, but they are often influenced by the central bank’s policies and market trends. Fixed-rate and variable-rate loans are common options, with fixed rates providing stability and variable rates potentially offering lower initial payments but with the risk of future increases.\n\nUsing a real estate agent or mortgage broker can simplify the process significantly. Real estate agents assist with property searches, negotiations, and legal formalities, while mortgage brokers help compare loan products and negotiate better terms with lenders. However, their services often come with additional fees.\n\nOverall, while buying a home can be challenging, proper planning, understanding the requirements, and seeking professional assistance can make the experience more manageable and successful.", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: In my country, robots are increasingly being used in various sectors, especially in manufacturing, healthcare, and customer service. In factories, robots assist in assembling products with precision and speed, reducing human error and increasing productivity.

I feel both impressed and cautious about this growing presence of robots. On the one hand, they can improve efficiency, safety, and convenience in our daily lives. On the other hand, I worry about the potential loss of jobs and overdependence on machines.

[SEP] Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.", "task_id": "10c9bef1-d410-4e08-a1f9-51f7dbfe0aac", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: **HSI Shows Strong Recovery and Promising Outlook**\n\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI) in Hong Kong has seen a strong and steady rise over the past six months, fueled largely by renewed investment from Mainland China.

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Sure! Here's a short story about a robot's journey through history:\n\n---\n\n### **The Time-Travelling Robot**\n\nIn the year 2125, a brilliant scientist named Dr. Elena Martinez created a robot named **Chrono**. Chrono was no ordinary robot; it was designed to travel through time and observe historical events. Dr. Martinez programmed Chrono with a mission: to learn from the past and bring back valuable knowledge to improve the future.\n\n#### **The Ancient World**\n\nChrono's first destination was ancient Egypt. It arrived in the bustling city of Thebes, where it marveled at the grandeur of the temples and pyramids. Chrono observed the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza, noting the ingenious techniques used by the builders. It recorded the daily lives of the Egyptians, their rituals, and their advancements in medicine and astronomy.\n\n#### **The Renaissance**\n\nNext, Chrono traveled to the Renaissance period in Florence, Italy. It met with great minds like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. Chrono was fascinated by the explosion of art, science, and culture. It watched as da Vinci sketched his famous inventions and as Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel. Chrono gathered insights into the human spirit's creativity and resilience.\n\n#### **The Industrial Revolution**\n\nChrono then journeyed to the Industrial Revolution in England. It witnessed the transformation of society as steam engines powered factories and railways. Chrono saw the challenges faced by workers and the innovations that improved their lives. It recorded the impact of technological advancements on society and the environment.\n\n#### **The Digital Age**\n\nFinally, Chrono returned to the late 20th century, the dawn of the digital age. It observed the rise of computers, the internet, and the birth of artificial intelligence. Chrono noted how these technologies connected people across the globe and transformed industries. It also saw the ethical dilemmas and challenges that came with rapid technological progress.\n\n#### **Returning Home**\n\nAfter its journey through history, Chrono returned to Dr. Martinez with a wealth of knowledge. It shared its observations, and together they worked on new innovations to benefit humanity. Chrono's adventures taught the world valuable lessons about creativity, resilience, and the importance of learning from the past.\n\n", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 0}

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In Saudi Arabia, robots are becoming increasingly integrated into various sectors. From hospitality to healthcare, they are transforming the way services are delivered. For instance, in the hospitality industry, robots are used to greet guests, manage check-ins, and even serve food. In healthcare, robots assist in surgeries, provide support in elderly care, and help with administrative tasks. I feel that the rise of robots in society brings both opportunities and challenges. Positively, robots can enhance efficiency, reduce human error, and perform tasks that are dangerous for humans. They can also contribute to economic growth by creating new job opportunities in tech and robotics. On the downside, the increasing use of robots could lead to job displacement for workers in traditional roles, and there are ethical concerns about privacy and the extent of automation in our lives. Balancing these aspects is crucial for ensuring that the benefits of robots are maximized while mitigating any negative impacts on society.", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Fortunately, no drugs were found during the operation.\n\nThe shipment was logged upon its return to the station at 4:54 AM on that fateful day, sealing an unfortunate fate for Barry Black.

There’s nothing like a possible reward to motivate people.\nTake an Active Interest in Their Career Paths: Offer additional training and act as their mentor.\nEmphasize a Healthy Work-Life Balance: Recognize that employees have lives outside the company.\nListen to Your Employees: If people feel like they are being heard, even when they are complaining, they will be happier and more productive.\n\nWays to Demotivate Your Staff:\nDisrespect Subordinates: Treating them poorly because they are below you.\nTake Credit for Their Work: Claiming responsibility for work done by your subordinates.\nLose Your Temper: Showing anger and frustration.\n\nFeedback:\nThe content is clear and well-organized, making it easy to follow.\nRepeating the same message multiple times is unnecessary and can be confusing. Stick to one version of the message.\nConsider adding specific examples or anecdotes to make the advice more relatable and actionable.\nGood luck with your team!\n\nBest regards, EF student", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 4}

It made me think about how leadership isn’t just for people with fancy titles—it’s more about how we carry ourselves, communicate, and support others.\n\nA few key things stuck with me: being self-aware, learning how to communicate better, and staying adaptable when things don’t go as planned. Also, emotional intelligence seems to be a big part of what separates a good leader from a great one—stuff like empathy, self-control, and staying calm under pressure.\n\nI’m finding that the more I focus on these areas, the better I am at handling everyday situations—not just at work, but in life in general.\n\nAnyway, just thought I’d share in case you’re into this kind of thing too.

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is a complex machine with several important parts that work together to make flight possible.\n\nThe fuselage is the main body of the airplane, where passengers and cargo are located. It provides structural support and holds the cockpit, where the pilots control the plane.\n\nThe wings are crucial for creating lift, allowing the plane to stay in the air. They are designed with a specific shape to help air move faster over the top than beneath, generating lift. Wings also often contain fuel tanks and may have ailerons to control the roll of the aircraft.\n\nThe tail includes the vertical stabilizer (the fin) and the horizontal stabilizer (the tailplane). The vertical stabilizer helps to keep the airplane steady by preventing unwanted side-to-side motion, while the horizontal stabilizer ensures the plane remains stable in pitch, preventing it from climbing or descending unexpectedly.\n\nFinally, the engines provide the thrust necessary for the plane to move forward. They push the airplane through the air and are usually located on the wings or the rear of the fuselage, depending on the plane's design. These components work together to keep the plane in motion and maintain control during flight.", "task_id": "65f455e8-4b01-40fd-bff6-0cb906d6006e", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Effective communication is essential in any workplace, especially when collaborating across teams. Understanding different perspectives and working styles can significantly improve how we present ideas and achieve collective goals. When making a proposal or suggestion, it's crucial to focus on how the idea benefits others, not just ourselves. This shift in perspective helps build trust and encourages cooperation. One useful strategy is to listen actively before speaking—by understanding the concerns and needs of others, we can tailor our arguments in a way that resonates. Additionally, being mindful of tone and language is key; sometimes, phrases that sound assertive or direct may unintentionally come across as pushy. Recording and reflecting on conversations can help identify potential areas for improvement. Ultimately, fostering a collaborative environment requires patience, empathy, and the willingness to adapt. By continuously refining our approach, we can Effective communication is the cornerstone of successful collaboration, especially when working with diverse teams. When we share ideas or propose solutions, it’s crucial to focus not only on what benefits us, but also on how our suggestions can support others. This approach helps us build credibility and foster cooperation. One of the most important things we can do before engaging with others is to listen actively and understand their needs, challenges, and goals. This insight allows us to frame our arguments in a way that appeals to their priorities, making it more likely that they will buy into our ideas. Additionally, it’s important to pay attention to our language and tone. What may seem like a well-intended suggestion could unintentionally come across as pushy or dismissive. Recording conversations or rehearsing arguments beforehand can be a helpful way to identify any potential issues with how we communicate. Moreover, understanding why past interactions have or haven’t been successful is valuable in shaping future approaches. Building strong, collaborative relationships takes time, patience, and empathy. By continually refining our communication strategies, we not only improve our chances of success, but also contribute to a positive and productive work environment.\n\n\n", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 0}

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: NAFTA: A Detailed Look at North American Trade\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a groundbreaking accord between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, officially coming into force in January 1994. The culmination of years of intricate negotiations, NAFTA's primary goal was to dramatically reduce or completely eliminate customs duties among its three member states. This initiative aimed to foster a more integrated and fluid economic environment across North America.\nNAFTA's impact was far-reaching, profoundly reshaping trade relations, particularly within the agricultural sector. A notable example of this transformation was the significant increase in the flow of Mexican fruits and vegetables into the US market. Beyond agriculture, the agreement influenced various industries by removing trade barriers, which theoretically made goods and services cheaper and more accessible across borders.\nWhile NAFTA generated both positive and negative impacts for each of the participating countries, the general consensus among economists and policymakers is that, overall, it benefited all three members. It spurred economic growth, increased trade volumes, and led to greater specialization in production among the nations. However, it also faced criticism, particularly concerning job displacement in certain sectors and environmental concerns. Despite these debates, NAFTA served as the cornerstone of North American trade policy for over two decades until it was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2020, marking a new chapter in regional economic cooperation.\nWould you like to know more about the specific impacts of NAFTA on any of the member countries, or perhaps about the USMCA that replaced it?\n", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

It was an old, mysterious mansion-themed room that promised to test our wits and teamwork. To be honest, we were a little nervous; we’d never done anything this intense before.\n\nWe entered the room, and immediately, the atmosphere was eerie, with vintage furniture, hidden compartments, and locked drawers. As we started to solve puzzles, we quickly realized how intricate everything was. There were cryptic clues hidden in paintings, secret codes embedded in books, and even a puzzle involving a dusty old grandfather clock.\n\nMark, with his knack for logic and puzzles, was absolutely on fire. He cracked codes in record time and guided us through the more complex riddles. With only five minutes left on the clock, we managed to unlock the final door—victorious!\n\nIt was such an exhilarating experience, and the best part was how we worked together under pressure.

Compare your notes with the model text at the end. [SEP] Response: The situation in the Federation of Pantasia began to cause the international community concern a year ago when an election resulted in a vote to break up the federation and form two separate countries for its two main ethnic groups, the Alphas and the Betas. Fighting broke out for control of the mineral-rich Argos Region, as well as between certain minority groups who were made refugees. There is also evidence of an attempt at ethnic cleansing of a minority group.\n\nSix months ago the military staged a coup to reunite the Federation. Although a large portion of the armed forces have returned to Federal control, elements have remained loyal to the new governments of Alpha and Beta. These armies have had small battles between themselves over disputed territories while resisting operations by the Federal forces based in Federal Territory.\n\nUntil a month ago the situation was a stalemate, however, the various factions have been rearming under the pretence of negotiations. Recently, strong leadership in Beta has resulted in a campaign that has pinned down Federal forces and Beta forces have also launched an all-out attack through Alpha territory to seize valuable land in Argos.\n\nThis has resulted in considerable civilian casualties, refugees and dislocation of population. There are reports of executions, rape, destruction of property and infrastructure. It is also believed that Beta has established concentration camps as part of its ethnic cleansing policy.\n\nApart from the problems of the ongoing conflicts, there has been the constant threat of hunger for the civilians in the area.  Earlier in the year the weather was unusually cold and dry, which resulted in crop failures. In recent weeks heavy rains have caused flooding and the destruction of bridges, roads and rail links, cutting off some of the most vulnerable villages.\n\nAs a result of the conflict and because of humanitarian concerns, Chapter VII of the UN Charter was invoked by a special resolution with strong rules of engagement (ROE) to impose peace, separate the warring factions and provide humanitarian care. An Implementation Phase, involving air power supported by ground troops, will be launched at 0600 hours on Monday unless the factions lay down their arms. This seems increasingly unlikely.\n\nIn addition to war-fighting the infantry units will be expected to conduct humanitarian operations, to protect people and improve basic facilities. The Implementation Phase is expected to last one month and then turn into a Stabilization Phase, although it is possible that the war fighting phase will last longer. During the Stabilization Phase, infantry units will be ensuring peace and security while a new government takes over and NGOs enter the country to assist the civilian population. Some units will also be involved in direct humanitarian work.\n\nConfidential\n\n", "task_id": "cffee9ec-0e17-4031-aeca-2723113def03", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: Buying homes is one of big making decisions in our life, I think. I do not know all cases when we buy house in our country. However, as far as I have known, most cases that people purchase some home here, they seem to borrow big amount of money from someone. People must make a long-term contract to pay back loan to their bank after they borrow money. Bank as itself, has not to turn losses after it decides to finance their customers, therefore, banks request their potential customers to submit all kind of documents and certificates to examine them closely in terms of their solvencies, reliabilities, and trustfulness. This process is sometimes very difficult for some people and not so much for others. Once people get approval for their loan and they are obliged to pay back all until they die or with their deaths. I think that the rate of interest in long term has not been at quite high level, which makes us to purchase our homes easily. However, this situation also applied to other country people to buy house in our country.

[SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a landmark trade pact signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, which came into effect on January 1, 1994. NAFTA aimed to eliminate most tariffs and trade barriers between the three countries, creating one of the largest free-trade zones in the world. The agreement was inspired by the success of the European Economic Community and sought to boost economic growth and job creation through increased trade and investment.\n\nNAFTA's main provisions included the gradual reduction of tariffs, customs duties, and other trade barriers over a period of up to 15 years. This allowed for duty-free access to a wide range of goods and services, fostering economic integration among the member countries. The agreement also included side agreements on labor and environmental standards to address concerns about the potential negative impacts of increased trade.\n\nDespite facing significant opposition and political debates, NAFTA was generally seen as beneficial for the North American economies. It facilitated the flow of goods, services, and capital, contributing to economic growth and higher living standards. However, it also had its critics, who argued that it led to job losses in certain industries exposed to trade competition.\n\nIn 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which aimed to modernize and update the trade relationship between the three countries.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Applying for a mortgage in Argentina is nearly impossible. Due to the instability of our currency, banks do not offer mortgages. Moreover, people do not want to compromise their savings for twenty-five years as it is difficult to plan that far ahead. The history of our country has made us precautious: we save all our money in a foreign currency, do not keep it in the banks, and high inflation encourages us to spend instead of saving due to how quickly prices increase. Additionally, governments do not keep steady policies.  \n\nLet’s imagine that mortgages did exist here, and were accesible, there would still be uncertainty. Let’s say that you manage to obtain an interview with the bank to apply. The banker reviews your bank statements, credit rating, and employment history concluding that you might qualify for a loan. However, they tell you that property values are in US dollars and that the loan is in Argentinian pesos. Therefore, if it happens that in between the time the loan was processed and you actually purchase the house, the foreign currency rate between ARS and USD dramatically increase, it might happen that the loan will not be enough to pay the property and the bank will not take any responsibility for that.  \n\nDue to these facts and the government not promoting such loans, many people resign to rent an apartment permanently. In the best scenario, you can save enough money in USD over the years to purchase a property without a mortgage. ", "task_id": "e56737ef-22af-472e-88bd-a73361bcb7d9", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Here’s how it could work:\n\nSmaller Showroom: We relocate to a more affordable area, reducing our rent significantly. This showroom would be smaller but still provide a space for customers to see and feel our fabrics and discuss their needs in person.\nEnhanced Online Platform: We invest in a top-notch website where customers can browse our collections, enter their measurements, and even schedule appointments for fittings at their convenience.\nMobile Tailoring Service: We offer a mobile service where we visit clients at their offices or homes for measurements and fittings. This personalized touch can help maintain the close relationships we’ve built with our customers.\nBenefits:\n\nCost Savings: Lower rent and operational costs.\nCustomer Convenience: Clients can choose between visiting the showroom or having us come to them.\nFlexibility: We can adapt to changing market conditions more easily.\nI believe this hybrid model could provide the best of both worlds, combining the personal touch of our current showroom with the cost savings and convenience of a more modern approach.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\nBest regards, \nPrayad", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

New York City is known for its fast-paced environment and towering skyscrapers. The city is bustling 24/7, and there's always something to do, whether it's exploring Broadway shows, visiting museums, or simply walking through the busy streets. The energy of the city is contagious, and people often rely on public transportation to get around due to the city's compact nature.\n\nIn contrast, Los Angeles presents a more laid-back atmosphere. While it is a major urban hub, its sprawling layout and car-centric culture create a more relaxed vibe compared to New York. The city is famous for its entertainment industry, with Hollywood being the heart of the film and television world. The sunny weather and proximity to beautiful beaches also make Los Angeles a more outdoor-oriented city, with residents enjoying activities like hiking, surfing, or relaxing by the ocean.\n\nWhile New York thrives on its density and constant activity, Los Angeles shines with its open spaces and focus on leisure.

Ao definir metas claras, conseguimos direcionar nossos esforços de maneira mais eficiente, evitando desperdícios de tempo e energia. O planejamento não se resume apenas a definir o que fazer, mas também a estabelecer prazos e recursos necessários para a execução de cada tarefa. Além disso, ele nos ajuda a antecipar possíveis obstáculos, permitindo que busquemos soluções antes que problemas se tornem críticos. No entanto, é importante lembrar que o planejamento deve ser flexível. Às vezes, imprevistos surgem e é preciso ajustar o rumo.

Thank you for reaching out regarding your concerns on how to motivate your employees. \nFrist, I recommend you to follow the ABR system, which stands for: Analyze, Benchmark and Reward. Analyze refers to review the current status on your team, for each members, this will allow you to clearly communicate your expectations while motivating your team on the setting of their objectives (this will definitely boos their motivation); B stands for Benchmarking, that is connected with the previous task: involve your team in the goal, make them feel part of the process, and lastly: reward. This mean to ensure there is a reward after success, this mean monitoring your team's performance, asses it and reward when the benchmark is reached or surpassed. You can use multiple options, such as prizes, bonus or even vouchers. \nAs part of your initial query, were are some behaviors you need to avoid: \n1. Lose your temper: although as a leader you will face stressful situations, keep calm, get together and then act. Remember good leadership lead by example. \n2. Don't let your team take blame for things: even if they commit an error, do nor focus on that but in how to improve, and\n3. Avoid compliment: some leaders don't compliment their teams after a success as they don't want them to \"do thing because of the compliment\", ignoring the fact that positive words of recognition can boost your team morale while provide feedback on their work. \n\nTo summarize the above, connect with your team to recognize their motivation and the proper way to approach them. \n\nDo not hesitate to reach out again in case further questions arise. \n\nRegards, \n\nJose", "task_id": "b4ba34ff-949d-4a82-9f56-ea472f177a71", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 4}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Kanye West, while undeniably talented and influential in the music and fashion industries, has increasingly become a controversial figure whose behavior often overshadows his artistic contributions. Once celebrated for redefining hip-hop with innovative albums like The College Dropout and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Kanye has in recent years drawn more attention for his erratic public outbursts, polarizing political statements, and concerning personal conduct. His tendency to make inflammatory remarks, such as those involving historical revisionism or offensive generalizations, suggests a troubling disregard for the social responsibility that comes with fame. Moreover, his insistence on framing himself as a misunderstood genius frequently undermines genuine accountability, turning legitimate criticism into perceived persecution. While mental health struggles should be met with compassion, they do not excuse harmful rhetoric or behavior, especially when amplified by a massive platform. Kanye’s ventures into politics and social commentary often feel more like self-serving performances than thoughtful engagement, reducing complex issues to soundbites and spectacle. Ultimately, his actions risk damaging the very legacy he worked so hard to build, alienating fans and tarnishing the respect he once commanded across industries.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

I’m writing to share an exciting update from our company regarding a recent change to our logo, which we believe will significantly enhance our brand presence.\n\nOver the past few months, we conducted a survey with our customers to gather feedback on various aspects of our brand, including our logo. The results highlighted that while our products are highly appreciated, our logo was perceived as somewhat \"old-fashioned\" and not fully aligned with the modern image we aim to project.

We are confident that this change will help strengthen our brand's reputation and appeal to both current and future customers. A more modern and dynamic visual identity will allow us to continue growing and competing effectively in an ever-evolving market.\n\nWe hope you share our excitement for this new chapter and look forward to continuing to provide you with exceptional products and services under this refreshed brand.

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: uccess is not something that happens by chance—it is the result of consistent effort, focus, and discipline. While talent and intelligence can open doors, discipline is what keeps those doors open. Discipline means having the ability to stay committed to your goals even when motivation fades. It’s waking up early to study, even when you feel tired. It’s choosing long-term rewards over short-term pleasures. Many successful people will tell you that their achievements didn’t come from moments of inspiration alone, but from small, disciplined actions repeated every single day.\n\nDiscipline also teaches you resilience. Life will present challenges, setbacks, and failures, but those who remain disciplined are better prepared to face them. They don’t give up after one failure—they learn from it, adjust their path, and keep moving forward. Ultimately, success is built not on luck, but on steady effort. With discipline, anything becomes possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: The jury was initially split, with eight jurors voting to convict defendants on charges of both the conspiracy and intent to incite riots, and four jurors voting to acquit the defendants on all charges. The foreman handed a hung-jury message to the marshal to take to the judge, but he instructed the jury to keep deliberating.\n\nIn the end, on February 18, 1970, all seven defendants were found not guilty on the conspiracy charges, two were acquitted completely, and five were convicted of inciting to riot. These five were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment and fined $5,000 on February 20, 1970. The convictions were all reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on November 21, 1972. The reasons for the reversal involved bias by the judge and his refusal to permit defense attorneys to question prospective jurors regarding cultural bias. The Justice Department decided not to re-try the case.\n\nDuring the trial, all the defendants and both defense attorneys were cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned. The contempt charges were re-tried before a different judge, who found four people guilty of some of the charges, but decided not to sentence the defendants to jail or fines.", "task_id": "ae90d852-9ab7-47ca-a8f8-4a90eaec83f4", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 0}

The entrance was almost completely closed, making it nearly invisible to me.\n\nCuriosity piqued, Antonio decided to explore the cave. Inside, the air was cool,. As Antonio ventured deeper, the cave opened up into a vast chamber illuminated by a mysterious, glowing crystal embedded in the ceiling.\n\nTo Antonio’s amazement, the chamber was filled with artifacts: ancient pottery, tools, and even a few pieces of jewelry. But the most astonishing discovery was a large, ornate chest. With a bit of effort, Antonio managed to open it, revealing a treasure trove of gold coins and precious gems.\n\nRealizing the significance of the find, Antonio carefully documented everything and reported it to the local authorities. The discovery has since sparked a wave of excitement among archaeologists and historians, eager to uncover the secrets of this hidden civilization.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 12.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write about how to develop leadership qualities. You can write about personal experiences or what you have seen happen in others. What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Developing leadership qualities is a process that requires self-awareness, patience, and continuous learning. Based on personal experience and observations of others, I believe that effective leadership starts with empathy and communication. Being able to listen to others and understand their perspectives is key to building trust within a team. Leadership isn’t about dominating conversations or making all the decisions; it's about empowering others to contribute their ideas and talents.\n\nAnother important quality is adaptability. Leaders must be able to navigate change and remain calm under pressure. A good leader is not afraid to make difficult decisions but does so with the best interests of the team in mind. I’ve seen leaders grow by seeking feedback and being open to constructive criticism, which helped them become more effective.\n\nI believe everyone has the potential to be a leader in their own way. Leadership isn’t restricted to titles or positions—it’s about influence and the ability to inspire others toward a common goal. With the right mindset and effort, anyone can cultivate leadership qualities over time.\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "ce3f3898-f2a7-4978-8f4f-17596f229f1d", "ef_level": 12.0, "label": 5}

What qualities do you think are most important? Do you think everyone has the potential to be a leader? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: Developing leadership qualities involves a combination of self-awareness, continuous learning, and practical experience. From my observations, effective leaders often exhibit qualities such as empathy, integrity, and the ability to inspire and motivate others.\n\nOne key quality is empathy. Leaders who understand and relate to their team members’ feelings and perspectives can build stronger, more cohesive teams. Integrity is also crucial; leaders who are honest and transparent earn the trust and respect of their colleagues.\n\nAnother important quality is the ability to inspire and motivate. Leaders who can articulate a clear vision and encourage others to work towards it can drive their teams to achieve great things. Adaptability is also essential, as leaders must navigate changing circumstances and challenges.\n\nI believe everyone has the potential to be a leader, but it requires dedication and a willingness to grow. Leadership is not just about holding a position of authority; it’s about influencing and guiding others positively.

Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: The Importance of Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a crucial aspect of modern business practices. It refers to the ethical obligation of companies to contribute positively to society and the environment. In today's world, where consumers are increasingly aware of social and environmental issues, CSR has become more important than ever.\n\nFirstly, CSR enhances a company's reputation. When businesses engage in responsible practices, such as reducing their carbon footprint, supporting local communities, or ensuring fair labor conditions, they build trust and loyalty among consumers. This positive image can lead to increased customer retention and attract new clients who value ethical considerations.\n\nSecondly, CSR can lead to financial benefits. Companies that prioritize sustainability often find innovative ways to reduce costs, such as through energy-efficient technologies or waste reduction strategies. Additionally, socially responsible companies may attract investors who are looking for ethical investment opportunities, further boosting their financial performance.\n\nMoreover, CSR fosters a positive work environment. Employees are more likely to feel motivated and engaged when they know their employer is committed to making a difference. This can lead to higher productivity, lower turnover rates, and a stronger sense of company pride.\n\nIn conclusion, corporate social responsibility is not just a moral obligation but a strategic advantage. By integrating CSR into their core operations, companies can enhance their reputation, achieve financial gains, and create a positive impact on society. As consumers and stakeholders continue to demand ethical practices, businesses must recognize the importance of CSR and strive to make a meaningful difference.\n\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

Write the report as clearly and concisely as possible. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Section: Observations and Recommendations on Psychological Operations\n\nDuring the exercise, the effectiveness of psychological operations (PSYOP) was assessed in influencing target audiences and shaping the operational environment. Observations revealed that tailored messaging, aligned with cultural and sociopolitical factors, had a significant impact on altering perceptions and behaviors. The use of multimedia platforms, including social media, was particularly effective in disseminating messages rapidly and broadly.\n\nHowever, several challenges were noted. Insufficient local expertise led to generic messaging that was less effective in resonating with specific demographics. Additionally, inadequate synchronization with overall operational objectives occasionally resulted in conflicting narratives.\n\nTo enhance the impact of PSYOP, we recommend the following:\n\n1. Invest in Local Expertise: Employ region-specific specialists to ensure messaging is culturally and contextually relevant.\n\n2. Strengthen Coordination: Establish clear communication channels between PSYOP teams and other operational units to align messaging with overarching goals.\n\n3.

Explain what each of the different parts are for, including the fuselage, wings, tail and engines. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: An airplane is composed of several key parts, each serving a specific function to ensure safe and efficient flight. The fuselage is the main body of the airplane, housing the cockpit, passengers, and cargo. The wings are crucial for lift, allowing the airplane to rise off the ground. Attached to the wings are ailerons and flaps; ailerons control roll, while flaps adjust lift and drag during takeoff and landing.\n\nThe tail assembly, or empennage, includes the horizontal stabilizer and vertical stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer helps maintain pitch stability, while the vertical stabilizer ensures yaw stability. The rudder, located on the vertical stabilizer, controls the airplane's left and right movement.\n\nThe engines provide the necessary thrust to propel the airplane forward. Modern airplanes typically use jet engines, which are efficient and powerful. The landing gear supports the airplane during takeoff, landing, and taxiing. It usually consists of wheels and struts that absorb the impact of landing.\n\nFinally, the cockpit is where pilots control the airplane, equipped with instruments and controls for navigation, communication, and monitoring the aircraft's systems.

And of course, no breakfast is complete without a selection of fresh-brewed coffees and teas, alongside fresh-squeezed orange and grapefruit juices.\n\nI’m super excited about this new initiative and hope you are too!

Persuade your design team to choose one of the designs for next year’s rollout. Write 100-150 words. [SEP] Response: The XZ3 and E-XZ3 options have a modern look, with superior aerodynamics, Gloonow traction, five-speed Presto transmission and V8 engine.\nThe differences between the models start externally with the wheelbase, with the E-XZ3 model having a shorter wheelbase, measuring 106.9 inches versus 107.1 inches for the XZ3 model.\nIn addition to the longer wheelbase, the XZ3 model has a more powerful engine, with 6.4 liters of gasoline, going from zero to 60 mph in 2.7 seconds and a top speed of 333.1 km/h. The E-XZ3 model has less power, with a 5.4-liter hydrogen-powered engine that goes from 0 to 60 mph in 5.7 seconds, reaching top speeds of 159.1 mph.\nI believe we should opt for the E-XZ3 model. Although the XZ3 model is superior in power and speed, the E-XZ3 model is a more advanced option in clean technology and contributes to the environment, reducing emissions of polluting gases, which can be an important brand for our company and is aligned with global demands and the new customer profile we seek, therefore being a differentiator in the market.", "task_id": "64058d7e-9b06-4ed8-9b01-5b7efb9fb3ef", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: The Hang Seng Index: Recent Trends and Growth**\n\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI), a major stock market index in Hong Kong, has demonstrated remarkable growth in the past six months, driven largely by investment from Mainland China. Sub-indices such as Properties and Utilities have experienced significant increases, reflecting the influence of this financial influx. Six months ago, the HSI faced a low of 20,956; however, it surged to a high of 27,499, showcasing its resilience and appeal to investors.\n\nExperts project further growth for the HSI in the coming year, fueled by two primary factors. First, sustained investment from other countries is expected to bolster the index's performance. Second, internal demand within Hong Kong itself will play a crucial role in maintaining upward momentum. These combined forces suggest a positive outlook for the Hang Seng Index, reinforcing its significance as a key indicator of Hong Kong's economic health and investment climate.\n", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: For me the best techniques for a creative writing are questioning and cubing.\nQuestioning technique is a five-step process which allows you to: recognize the richness and diversity of your subject (exploration); gather as much information as possible about this aspect (discovery); make some sense out of the body of information you’ve assembled (classification); determine what you want to say to the reader, and the order in which you want to say it (selecting and ordering).\n\nCubing technique is when before people write something important they often start with pre-writing to help them organize ideas, outline and clarify their thoughts and sort through what they really want to write.\nA cube can help a person to think about their topic. It can be observed and described from six different angles and a few minutes can be spent writing about each of these. Any six prompts can be used on the cube. As an example, the six sides of a cube can be: describe, compare, associate, analyze, apply and argue.\n\n", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 4}

The summary information in this report offers an initial overview of the different commodities present, although the amount and quality of data for each commodity vary.\n\nFindings\n\nPetroleum shows have been identified, but further testing is required on rocks of different ages. Surveys indicate that the field contains all the necessary elements for major oil and gas accumulations, including source rocks, reservoirs, and trapping mechanisms. However, the density of exploratory wells is sparse, which increases the exploration risk.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the limited information available, we estimate the ultimate recovery from Carlos Fields to be approximately 21 million barrels of oil. With the application of tertiary recovery techniques and advancements in enhanced oil recovery, this estimate could potentially be exceeded.\n\nRecommendations\n\nTo gain a more comprehensive understanding of the oil, gas, and coal resources in the area, it is crucial to conduct a detailed geologic-engineering evaluation. This would involve acquiring new seismic data, compiling existing data, producing detailed structural contour maps for each potential reservoir, modeling the basic source rock parameters, and calculating petroleum volumetrics for each of the potential rocks", "task_id": "d01ca0b4-5249-49a4-8daf-ac2e0f274357", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

In factories, robotic arms assemble cars and electronics with precision, boosting productivity and reducing costs. In agriculture, drones and robotic harvesters are helping farmers optimize planting, irrigation, and harvesting processes, increasing efficiency in a sector vital to the economy. Robots are also starting to appear in hospitals, assisting with surgeries or delivering medication, and in retail, they enhance customer experiences by providing information or managing inventory. I find this growing presence of robots exciting yet complex. They promise significant benefits: increased efficiency, reduced human error, and the potential to take on dangerous or repetitive tasks. However, their impact is not entirely positive. Automation could lead to job displacement in certain sectors, requiring workers to upskill or face unemployment. Additionally, the reliance on technology raises concerns about data security and ethical usage. In the long term, robots will likely reshape society, demanding thoughtful policies and education systems to ensure a balance between technological progress and social well-being.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 13.0 [SEP] Prompt: A website has invited you to write your opinion on the topic of corporate social responsibility. Read the postings before you begin. Remember the structure you've learned on how to construct an argument. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Is Corporate Social Responsibility Really a Duty or Just PR?\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is often praised as a moral obligation companies have toward society. Supporters argue that businesses thrive because of communities, resources, and infrastructure, so giving back is a form of ethical reciprocity. By supporting education, sustainability, and social initiatives, corporations don’t just elevate their public image—they foster long-term trust and stability.\n\nHowever, critics suggest that CSR is less about ethics and more about marketing. They argue that many companies adopt CSR to polish their reputation, not to contribute meaningfully. When CSR programs are poorly funded or disconnected from a company’s core values, they become hollow gestures. Moreover, focusing too much on CSR might distract companies from their primary role—creating economic value and jobs.\n\nStill, CSR need not be a binary of profit vs. principle. In fact, strong CSR initiatives can drive profit by aligning business goals with societal needs. For instance, companies investing in green technology not only help the planet but also future-proof their operations.\n\nIn contrast to the view that CSR is mere PR, its real value lies in integrating social good with business strategy. If done authentically and transparently, CSR becomes a powerful force for both societal progress and corporate resilience.\n\n", "task_id": "8f1a0c16-d259-4737-af06-b6b6eb9e9799", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

Next month, it will be raised 25% to $4,500 per month. That's going to eat even more into our profits. I mean, Josh, that's $54,000 a year!\n\nI'm going to summarize our discussions here. I know that you are strongly in favor of just staying where we are and paying the higher rent. The obvious disadvantages of that are that our sales of clothing are increasing more slowly than our expenses AND with the rapid growth in Centerville, we can expect further rent increases in the coming months. The big pro for staying is that we're in a fashionable district where long-term customers know us. We're right downtown, so customers can come in on their lunch breaks to be measured for a suit or other high-end clothing.\n\nYou know that I favor going to a completely different model. We move to the south end of town for making the clothes, but create a system where we meet people in their offices or schools to measure them for new clothes. We also open up a much better webpage than what we have now so that customers can view our clothing options and enter their measurements. Incredible cost savings! The con of that is that we lose the showroom, where customers can just come in and look at the possibilities, feel the cloth and talk to us about what would be appropriate for them. Far less personalized service, which has helped us build close relationships with our customers.\n\nHonestly, I'd like another option, but I'm out of ideas. Should we talk to more people?

The shipment was considered reliable, yet it was subject to a year-long investigation possibly due to suspicions of drug smuggling.\n\nAt the scene, several suspects attempted to flee, but most were captured and detained, including three human mules. Barry Black was one of the individuals involved. The shipment, valued at $5 million, consisted of black market cigarettes and cigars, marking the largest shipment to date, although no drugs were found.\n\nThe shipment was logged upon return to the station at 4:54 AM on Friday the 13th of May, an unlucky day for Barry Black, possibly due to the capture and detention related to the investigation.", "task_id": "431f9c4e-8305-4cd4-9660-f2e24bd311df", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 3}

Due to globalisation, there is a constant expectation from the organisations to promote not national interest but global interest as well.

The organisation can set up hospital where they can provide health services to the needy people free of cost or at nominal fee along with free medicine and other services. The other way to contribute to the society is to build the good infrastructure like roadway or railways which can connect the remote location of the country to the developed cities or metropolitans. While utilising the natural resources it is very important that the organisation should be very careful in considering it adverse effect on the nature which will ultimately will impact the society as a whole in terms of increase in the land, noise or water pollutions.

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In my country, robots are increasingly being integrated into various sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture. In factories, robots streamline production lines, enhancing efficiency and precision in assembly tasks. In hospitals, robotic systems assist in surgeries, enabling minimally invasive procedures that lead to quicker recovery times. In agriculture, drones and automated machines are used for planting and crop monitoring, improving yield and reducing labor costs. While I find these advancements exciting and indicative of progress, I also harbor concerns about the potential negative impacts on society. For instance, the increasing reliance on robots might lead to job displacement in certain sectors, further exacerbating unemployment issues. Additionally, the ethical implications of using robots in caregiving or decision-making roles raise questions about accountability and empathy. However, if implemented thoughtfully, robots can help alleviate labor shortages and tackle challenging tasks, ultimately improving quality of life.

Ask yourself guiding questions to help organize the writing. Type in the input box. Write 150-250 words. [SEP] Response: Language learning can be both exciting and challenging. One common issue students face is motivation. It's easy to start with enthusiasm, but as time goes on, it can be difficult to maintain that drive, especially when progress feels slow. So, how can learners stay motivated? Setting small, achievable goals and celebrating progress can help.\n\nAnother challenge is the fear of making mistakes. Many students hesitate to speak for fear of sounding incorrect or awkward. This fear can lead to avoidance of conversation practice, which is crucial for improvement. To overcome this, creating a supportive and non-judgmental learning environment can make a significant difference.\n\nAdditionally, mastering pronunciation and accent is often difficult. Sounds in a new language may not exist in the student's native tongue, making it tricky to pronounce words correctly. What strategies can help with this? Listening to native speakers, practicing regularly, and using language learning apps can be effective.\n\nFinally, understanding cultural context is key. Language isn't just about words; it's about communication styles, gestures, and social norms. Students should be encouraged to explore the culture associated with the language to enhance their understanding and fluency.\n\nBy addressing these challenges thoughtfully, language learners can make steady progress and enjoy the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Celebrity culture, at its core, often reflects a troubling distortion of values in modern society. It elevates individuals—frequently for attributes like appearance, charisma, or social media savvy—above others whose contributions may be more meaningful but less sensational. This elevation can foster a culture of superficiality, where public admiration is detached from merit or integrity, and attention is the ultimate currency.\nThe influence celebrities wield—social, political, or cultural—is frequently disproportionate to their expertise. While some use their platforms responsibly, others disseminate misinformation or reinforce harmful norms, protected by fame’s halo effect. In this way, celebrity can erode critical thinking and distract from substantive issues, replacing dialogue with spectacle.\nThe machinery of celebrity tends to commodify people, turning them into brands to be consumed rather than complex individuals. As a result, both fans and celebrities themselves can suffer: fans are fed an illusion of intimacy or idealism that promotes envy or dissatisfaction with their own lives, while celebrities often lose privacy and autonomy, trapped in a cycle of performance and public scrutiny.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Be sure to polish your work before you submit it. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In English, when using third conditional sentences (which describe unreal situations in the past), we can apply a structure called inversion to sound more formal or literary. Normally, the third conditional follows this structure:\nIf + subject + had + past participle, subject + would have + past participle.\nExample: If I had seen him, I would have said hello.\n\nHowever, we can invert the first part of this sentence by removing “if” and placing “had” before the subject. This is called inverted conditional and is grammatically correct and often used in formal writing or speeches. So, the sentence becomes:\n👉 Had I seen him, I would have said hello.\n\nThis structure keeps the same meaning but adds emphasis and formality. The same rule applies with “should” and “were” in other conditionals:\n\nShould you need help, let me know.\n\nWere I you, I’d reconsider.\n\nIn short, “Had I seen him” is the correct and formal inverted form of “If I had seen him.”", "task_id": "bdd2883c-b71b-4fb7-a44c-a53e7bbf26f4", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 0}

The agreement facilitated the free movement of goods and services, leading to increased economic integration and trade among the member nations1.\n\nNAFTA’s provisions included the gradual reduction of tariffs, customs duties, and other trade barriers over a period of up to 15 years2. It also addressed issues such as intellectual property rights, environmental standards, and labor cooperation1. While NAFTA significantly boosted trade and investment in North America, it also faced criticism for its impact on employment and wages in certain industries2.\n\nIn 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which updated and revised many of the original agreement’s provisions to better reflect the modern economic landscape", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

While the agreement brought many benefits, including increased exports and job creation in some sectors, it also had its downsides. Critics argued that NAFTA led to job losses in certain U.S. industries, such as manufacturing, as companies moved operations to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs. Despite these challenges, overall, NAFTA was seen as beneficial to all three countries by increasing trade, fostering economic growth, and encouraging investment across the region.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

Compare your notes with the model text at the end. [SEP] Response: Confidential\n\nPANTASIA – Background Information for Deploying Units\n\nThe situation in the Federation of Pantasia began to cause the international community concern a year ago when an election resulted in a vote to break up the federation and form two separate countries for its two main ethnic groups, the Alphas and the Betas. Fighting broke out for control of the mineral-rich Argos Region, as well as between certain minority groups who were made refugees. There is also evidence of an attempt at ethnic cleansing of a minority group.\n\nSix months ago the military staged a coup to reunite the Federation. Although a large portion of the armed forces have returned to Federal control, elements have remained loyal to the new governments of Alpha and Beta. These armies have had small battles between themselves over disputed territories while resisting operations by the Federal forces based in Federal Territory.\n\nUntil a month ago the situation was a stalemate, however, the various factions have been rearming under the pretence of negotiations. Recently, strong leadership in Beta has resulted in a campaign that has pinned down Federal forces and Beta forces have also launched an all-out attack through Alpha territory to seize valuable land in Argos.\n\nThis has resulted in considerable civilian casualties, refugees and dislocation of population. There are reports of executions, rape, destruction of property and infrastructure. It is also believed that Beta has established concentration camps as part of its ethnic cleansing policy.\n\nApart from the problems of the ongoing conflicts, there has been the constant threat of hunger for the civilians in the area.  Earlier in the year the weather was unusually cold and dry, which resulted in crop failures. In recent weeks heavy rains have caused flooding and the destruction of bridges, roads and rail links, cutting off some of the most vulnerable villages.\n\nAs a result of the conflict and because of humanitarian concerns, Chapter VII of the UN Charter was invoked by a special resolution with strong rules of engagement (ROE) to impose peace, separate the warring factions and provide humanitarian care. An Implementation Phase, involving air power supported by ground troops, will be launched at 0600 hours on Monday unless the factions lay down their arms. This seems increasingly unlikely.\n\nIn addition to war-fighting the infantry units will be expected to conduct humanitarian operations, to protect people and improve basic facilities. The Implementation Phase is expected to last one month and then turn into a Stabilization Phase, although it is possible that the war fighting phase will last longer. During the Stabilization Phase, infantry units will be ensuring peace and security while a new government takes over and NGOs enter the country to assist the civilian population.

Language learning requires regular exposure and use, but busy schedules or lack of motivation can make it hard to stay on track. How can students build habits that support daily practice?\n\n**Vocabulary retention** is also a common struggle. Students may learn new words but forget them quickly without proper review. Could using flashcards or spaced repetition systems help?\n\nFinally, **listening comprehension** can be difficult, especially when native speakers talk quickly or use slang. Watching shows, listening to podcasts, or speaking with native speakers can improve this skill over time.\n", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

Despite being portrayed as a villain, Ravana is also depicted as a learned scholar and a devotee of Lord Shiva, illustrating the nuanced portrayal of Rakshasas in these stories.\n\nRakshasas symbolize the darker aspects of human nature and the eternal struggle between good and evil, often serving as catalysts for the heroes' journeys and moral lessons in Indian mythology.", "task_id": "f03e111e-8a30-48fe-991b-6adfea2444ad", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: \nPharmacy today\nKey industry players\nMost of the pharmaceutical industry is concentrated in developed regions – the U.S., Europe and Japan. The market is characterized by complex national regulations and consolidation among the largest international groups.  An important reason for these mergers is the need for economies of scale, as well as the increasing amount of money dedicated to research and development (R&D).\n\nGlaxoSmithKline\nGlaxoSmithKline is a leading company focusing on research. The company was formed in 2000 through the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. Their headquarters are in the U.K., and their operations are based in the U.S. It employs more than 90,000 people worldwide and has offices in nearly every country of the world. This pharmaceutical giant holds an estimated 7 percent of the world's pharmaceutical market.\n\nConcentrating on four therapeutic areas (anti-infectives, central nervous system, respiratory and gastro-metabolic), among its most prominent products are Paxil, for depression, and Advair, for asthma. GSK is a leader in the vaccine area and has a growing portfolio of oncology products, including Hycamtin and Zofran for treating cancer. The company’s R&D budget is about $7 billion.\n\nPfizer\nPfizer is one of the world's largest consumer healthcare and pharmaceutical companies, having acquired Warner-Lambert in the year 2000. The company has three business segments: human health, animal health and consumer healthcare. The consumer business includes many of the world's best-known brands, among them Halls, Tetra, Benadryl, Sudafed, Listerine, Desitin, Schick, Visine, Bengay, Lubriderm and Zantac.\n\nMerck & Co.\nAnother leading company is Merck, a global, research-driven pharmaceutical company working toward the ", "task_id": "3ef52563-7f79-446a-b692-6435408e5461", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 0}

Liam called me, his voice shaky. \"I just saw something... something I can't explain,\" he said.\n\nI thought he was joking at first. He'd always been the one to mess around with tall tales.

He explained that while walking home, he'd seen a figure in the distance—familiar, yet unsettling. He tried to approach, but the figure vanished into thin air.\n\nWe laughed it off at first, but when we checked his phone later, there was a photo—a blurry image of a person standing just a few feet away from him. I didn’t see anyone in the photo. We never did make that trip.

By effectively managing time, people can increase productivity, reduce stress, and achieve a better work-life balance. Prioritizing tasks and setting clear goals help in making the most out of the available time. Tools like calendars, to-do lists, and time-tracking apps can aid in this process. Moreover, time management enables individuals to allocate sufficient time for rest and recreation, which is essential for mental and physical well-being. In the workplace, efficient time management leads to meeting deadlines, increased job satisfaction, and career advancement. It also fosters a sense of discipline and responsibility. In conclusion, mastering the art of time management is fundamental to leading a successful and balanced life, allowing individuals to make the most of every moment and achieve their goals.", "task_id": "56de3bdd-b83e-4dd4-9213-446b7e00e3cd", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 0}

Make it interesting and descriptive, and remember to check for pronoun reference. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: I picked up Emily Henry’s Beach Read a couple of years ago when I found out she was a fellow Hope College alum, and there were a few references to unique Hope experiences, such as late-night donut adventures. I quickly became a fan. Her storytelling is unmatched and I eagerly await every new release. Last month, when she released Funny Story, I picked it up at my local bookshop that day and finished it within the week! Once again, her one-of-a-kind character building told a story I couldn’t put down.\n\nI will give a bit of a disclaimer up front: this book did have a bit more “spice” than I would usually go for, but for me, the storytelling made the read worth it for me.\n\nDaphne, a librarian, moved to her fiance Peter’s hometown of Waning Bay, Michigan to start a life together. Daphne adores the way he tells their love story, but their life together comes to a screeching halt when he realizes he’s in love with his childhood best friend Petra.\n\nDaphne moves in with Petra’s ex fiance, Miles, so Petra and Peter can move in together, leaving Daphne and Miles to put their lives back together. Despite finding themselves in similar life situations, the newfound roommates couldn’t be more opposite. For example, Miles is neighborly and knows everyone in town while Daphne’s coworkers think she’s a secret agent since no one knows anything about her life. \n\nThey do their best to coexist and avoid each other in the apartment, but eventually start to form a friendship due to their close quarters. Begrudgingly, Daphne agrees to let Miles show her around town, with a countdown to her eagerly awaited Read-A-Thon (the only thing keeping her in Waning Bay) and an unexpected plan to deceive their exes.\n\nDaphne’s job as a librarian means several book references throughout the story, which warms my bookish heart. From a Station Eleven reference to alluding to the author characters from Henry’s Beach Read, these references are a bonus to help the reader illustrate Daphne’s personality based on her literary favorites. \n\nBoth Daphne and Miles are surprised by unexpected visitors, which brings some bumps in the road for their relationship – and a full apartment which presents its own challenges. Again, their different life paths leave them in a similar situation: putting the pieces together from the relationships that have deeply affected their own stories. \n\nOne of my favorite quotes which is perfectly descriptive of Daphne and Miles’ relationships with their exes and families, and affects how they view their relationship with each other, is Daphne’s advice on waiting.\n\n“You can’t force a person to show up, but you can learn a lesson when they don’t.\n\nTrust people’s actions, not their words.\n\nDon’t love anyone who isn’t ready to love you back.\n\nLet go of the people who don’t hold on to you.\n\nDon’t wait on anyone who’s in no rush to get to you.”\n\nThey also continue finding favorite Waning Bay spots, with their sidekick, Daphne’s cowo", "task_id": "52a760cd-9898-4cce-bb43-c490923b2b45", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 4}

I can imagine it could be divided into three equal parts to symbolize that each party has the same rights and obligations. \n\nTo clarify, this is about the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the US, Canada, and Mexico. After years of negotiation, it came into force in January 1994.\nIt's hard to remember, but before NAFTA, the countries had different tariffs for various goods to protect their domestic industries. Imagine how much effort it must have taken to transport goods across borders without smartphones and advanced computers—lots of paperwork and signing. After forming the market, NAFTA reduced the amount of customs duties among the members. It has had a profound effect on trade relations, especially in agriculture; for example, Mexican fruits and vegetables flow into the US.\n\nAs a matter of fact, there are both positive and negative impacts on the members. \nBefore NAFTA, Mexico was a self-sufficient country, but now it is flooded with US agricultural products and meat, which are cheaper than domestic products. Smaller Mexican domestic agriculture companies have had to close under the cost pressure. Canada is now a major exporter of raw materials but has to fight against environmental exploitation. Completely different in US, for labor cost reduction were jobs relocated from the US to Mexico. \n\nHowever, I believe they need to address the problems in the right order to save small producers and ensure overall benefits for all members.", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 4}

You've been asked by your editor to write a report on the performance of the Hang Seng (HSI) stock market index. You have some notes and a graph as your guide. Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: Steady Growth in Hang Seng Index Signals Positive Outlook for Hong Kong Market\n\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI) in Hong Kong has shown remarkable resilience and steady growth over the past six months, fueled largely by increased investment from Mainland China. After hitting a low of 20,956 points six months ago, the index has climbed steadily, reaching a high of 27,499 recently. This significant rise reflects growing confidence among investors in the region’s economic prospects.\n\nKey contributors to this growth are the Properties and Utilities sub-indices, both of which have surged dramatically. The expansion of these sectors is closely linked to economic growth in Mainland China, where increased demand and infrastructure development have created a ripple effect benefiting Hong Kong’s market.\n\nExperts remain optimistic about the future of the HSI. Predictions indicate that the index is poised to continue its upward trajectory into next year, supported not only by ongoing investment from China but also by new capital inflows from other international investors. Additionally, Hong Kong’s strong internal demand is expected to sustain this positive momentum.\n\nOverall, the Hang Seng Index’s performance signals a robust and expanding financial environment, making it an attractive prospect for both local and global investors.", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

Write an article of 150-200 words, making it as accurate and interesting as possible. [SEP] Response: Hang Seng Index Sees Strong Start to October Amid Volatility\n\nThe Hang Seng Index (HSI), Hong Kong’s leading stock market benchmark, has started October on a mixed yet hopeful note, driven by fluctuations in global markets and ongoing economic uncertainty in China. After a period of lackluster performance through September, the HSI showed signs of resilience, closing with gains during the first week of the new month, buoyed by a recovery in the technology and real estate sectors.\n\nKey Chinese tech giants, such as Tencent and Alibaba, saw a slight rebound, with investors betting on a possible recovery in the Chinese economy, which has been grappling with property market woes and slowing growth. Government support measures and the People's Bank of China's latest liquidity injection seem to have bolstered sentiment, though caution remains due to persistent global inflation concerns and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies.\n\nHowever, despite these gains, the HSI remains volatile, with traders keeping a close eye on U.S.-China trade relations and geopolitical developments. Analysts expect the index to remain sensitive to both domestic and international factors in the coming weeks. While the Hang Seng has room for recovery, market participants should brace for continued swings amid a challenging global economic landscape. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "task_id": "5d0a4e6c-37d4-4189-bf76-0ed3cba9ce0a", "ef_level": 8.0, "label": 5}

It is disappointing that many celebrities, instead of using their influence for positive change, focus mainly on promoting their own brand and wealth.\n\nTake, for example, the phenomenon of influencers becoming famous for little more than taking pictures of themselves. It is hard not to feel frustrated when people who achieve real accomplishments—scientists, teachers, activists—receive only a fraction of the recognition. Admittedly, some celebrities do use their platform for good causes, but overall, the culture promotes shallow values. To make matters worse, young people grow up believing that fame is the highest goal, rather than developing skills or helping others. In short, the celebration of fame for its own sake is not only unhelpful but also damaging to society’s deeper values. Wouldn't it be better if admiration was earned through meaningful achievement rather than popularity?", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

Read his email, then write the executive summary telling which one he recommends, Office One or Office Bravo. Type in the input box. Write 50-75 words. Use your own words where possible. [SEP] Response: We are very pleased with the opportunity to deepen our partnership with Westpac and believe our proposal provides the most comprehensive approach for Westpac to execute its strategy successfully.  This initiative is critical for Westpac to differentiate its service delivery model in the midst of an industry shift towards growing customer share.  Westpac lags behind its key competitors and the risk of further customer attrition will result in a systemic deterioration of profitability.            \nWestpac and Verint have formed a shared perspective on the importance of operational improvements to the bank’s overall transformation.  Our diagnostic work earlier this year suggests that a successful transformation program can free up at least 2,000 personnel for frontline sales roles over the next 12-24 months.  Assuming current levels of Westpac sales productivity, migration of 2,000 personnel to the frontline could add $156 million in annual revenues.  \nAs important, a successful redesign of existing operating processes will allow the bank to substantially improve turnaround times for customers and free up time consuming tasks carried out by frontline staff.  We therefore view operations transformation not simply as gaining efficiencies in back office processes, but as a strategic catalyst to lower cost, reduce frontline work, improve customer service, and increase the bank’s capabilities as if offers more complex products and services to market.  As such, operations transformation is an integral part of Westpac’s customer centric strategy that must be executed in full alignment with the bank’s new strategic direction\n", "task_id": "30d1e722-4061-4790-ae33-52000cd6533c", "ef_level": 6.0, "label": 0}

Compare your notes with the model text at the end. [SEP] Response: Confidential\n\nPANTASIA – Background Information for Deploying Units\n\nThe situation in the Federation of Pantasia began to cause the international community concern a year ago when an election resulted in a vote to break up the federation and form two separate countries for its two main ethnic groups, the Alphas and the Betas. Fighting broke out for control of the mineral-rich Argos Region, as well as between certain minority groups who were made refugees. There is also evidence of an attempt at ethnic cleansing of a minority group.\n\nSix months ago the military staged a coup to reunite the Federation. Although a large portion of the armed forces have returned to Federal control, elements have remained loyal to the new governments of Alpha and Beta. These armies have had small battles between themselves over disputed territories while resisting operations by the Federal forces based in Federal Territory.\n\nUntil a month ago the situation was a stalemate, however, the various factions have been rearming under the pretence of negotiations. Recently, strong leadership in Beta has resulted in a campaign that has pinned down Federal forces and Beta forces have also launched an all-out attack through Alpha territory to seize valuable land in Argos.\n\nThis has resulted in considerable civilian casualties, refugees and dislocation of population. There are reports of executions, rape, destruction of property and infrastructure. It is also believed that Beta has established concentration camps as part of its ethnic cleansing policy.\n\nApart from the problems of the ongoing conflicts, there has been the constant threat of hunger for the civilians in the area.  Earlier in the year the weather was unusually cold and dry, which resulted in crop failures. In recent weeks heavy rains have caused flooding and the destruction of bridges, roads and rail links, cutting off some of the most vulnerable villages.\n\nAs a result of the conflict and because of humanitarian concerns, Chapter VII of the UN Charter was invoked by a special resolution with strong rules of engagement (ROE) to impose peace, separate the warring factions and provide humanitarian care. An Implementation Phase, involving air power supported by ground troops, will be launched at 0600 hours on Monday unless the factions lay down their arms. This seems increasingly unlikely.\n\nIn addition to war-fighting the infantry units will be expected to conduct humanitarian operations, to protect people and improve basic facilities. The Implementation Phase is expected to last one month and then turn into a Stabilization Phase, although it is possible that the war fighting phase will last longer. During the Stabilization Phase, infantry units will be ensuring peace and security while a new government takes over and NGOs enter the country to assist the civilian population. Some units will also be involved in direct humanitarian work.\n\nConfidential", "task_id": "cffee9ec-0e17-4031-aeca-2723113def03", "ef_level": 14.0, "label": 0}

[SEP] Response: Hi Josh and Ken,\n\nThanks for the detailed summary and thoughts—Ken, I really appreciate how clearly you’ve laid out the two directions we’ve been considering. It’s clear we’re at a turning point, and we need to be strategic about our next move.\n\nI’d like to propose a third option that combines the strengths of both ideas: a hybrid model that leverages a smaller showroom in a growing, more affordable district, coupled with a mobile and online presence.\n\nI’ve been researching locations and think the East Park District in Centerville could be ideal. It’s about 15 minutes from downtown, and commercial rents there are currently averaging around $2,200/month—less than half of what we’d pay if we stay. East Park is undergoing a wave of development, with new residential buildings and co-working spaces attracting a younger, professional crowd.\n\nHere’s what I’m thinking:\n\n\t•\tWe open a compact, stylish showroom in East Park, where customers can still come in to see fabrics, discuss their needs, and get measured. We don’t need the same size or setup as now—just enough to maintain our in-person, high-touch service.\n\n\t•\tWe expand our digital platform with a revamped website, offering virtual consultations and self-service measurement tools.\n\n\t•\tWe continue the mobile measurement model, especially for corporate clients, allowing us to meet them at their offices, which many will appreciate for convenience.\nPros:\n\n\t•\tWe retain a physical presence to preserve our brand identity and client relationships.\n\n\t•\tWe dramatically reduce overhead.\n\n\t•\tWe position ourselves in a growing neighborhood with long-term potential.\n\n\t•\tWe modernize and diversify our customer engagement.\nCons:\n\n\t•\tWe’d still lose the central downtown foot traffic.\n\n\t•\tThere’s an initial investment required to build the website and rebrand slightly.\n\nI think this strikes a balance between stability and innovation. If it sounds promising, I’d love to meet up and work out the numbers together or even take a quick trip to East Park to scout locations.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\nBest, ", "task_id": "c7972fb8-c4a3-4fd8-8892-33804a60162e", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 5}

Many employees have expressed dissatisfaction with being mixed in classes, which can undermine the overall effectiveness of the training experience. In contrast, Skills Pro, while more expensive, has a strong track record of success among participants.

Given that the building is quite old, it’s understandable why the premiums are high. However, there are some changes you can make to reduce risks and possibly lower your insurance costs.\n\nFirst, the blocked drainpipes and leaky roof on the exterior should be fixed as soon as possible to prevent water damage and structural problems. Also, the untidy yard and cluttered sidewalk can pose safety hazards, so clearing these areas is important.\n\nInside the shop, poor lighting and stacked boxes increase the risk of accidents. Improving lighting and organizing storage will help. The old fire extinguishers need to be replaced or serviced to meet safety standards. Lastly, loose chemicals should be securely stored to avoid any dangerous spills.\n\nMaking these improvements will not only protect your business and customers but may also convince insurers to offer you better rates.

[SEP] Response: Housing loan in India has become a very unafforadable option in modern times. Historically, Indian architecture is based on ancient theory and practical values in terms of directions, energy, radiancy and astronomical factors.

A few generations ago, parcels of land was available at dirt cheap rates whereas with rapid urbanization and industrialization, plots of land in big cities is something only the elite can think of nowadays. The rich and middle class are more or less confined to buying apartments which don't make much sense with facilities and mainteannce considered very shabby and not up to the mark. A lot of black money is involved in real estate further driving the dearer index. The process to get loan from banks is cumbersome and full of red tape. People work their whole career and save a big lump sum towards retirement to get into owning their home but with inflation and all the factors described above, the real estate is a big bubble going to burst one day.

Yoga enthusiasts flock to Rishikesh, often called the \"Yoga Capital of the World,\" to learn and practice this ancient discipline.\n\nIn contrast, Goa has a more laid-back, festive, and secular culture. The state has a unique blend of Indian and Portuguese influences, as it was a former Portuguese colony. This cultural amalgamation is evident in its architecture, music, dance, and cuisine. Goa is famous for its vibrant carnivals, beach parties, and lively nightlife. The influence of Christianity is also prominent, with several churches and festivals like Christmas and Easter being celebrated with great enthusiasm.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 8.0 [SEP] Prompt: Rewrite the termination section of the contract to take into account possible discrimination either against or by the employer or employee. Compare your amendment with the model. This is a non-graded activity. [SEP] Response: Last month, an interesting lawsuit began that opens a window into our changing economy and, perhaps, our changing society.\n\nJohn Bottoms, ex-CFO of the US steel conglomerate Big Steel Co., was made redundant due to, in the company’s words, ‘our changing financial climate’. Bottoms had worked in the company for over thirty years and was therefore due a decent severance package. He was, however, only 49 at the time, and would be competing with jobseekers ten or twenty years his junior. Finding another job equal to the one he had lost might prove to be impossible.\n\nIt was with this in mind that Bottoms came to a startling decision: turn down the severance package and sue Big Steel Co.\n\nCrazy? Perhaps. Brave? Definitely. Yet Bottoms was only following what is becoming a new trend in the legal area of contracts and employment: unlawful dismissal and unfair severance packages. Over the last five years, the number of employment-related civil court actions – not just in the area of severance disputes, but also sexual harassment, racial discrimination and unfair dismissal – has more than doubled.\n\nThe largest increase in these disputes has been for age discrimination. Trends show that employees are staying on in a company longer than previous generations. Yet, companies often want to let go their more elderly staff and invest in youth. Hence the reason for so many disputes. Experts, however, say it might not be the case that there is more discrimination in the workplace than before, rather there is more awareness of the issue.\n\nWhatever the case may be, companies are taking action to guard against future lawsuits. One such action is the purchasing of liability insurance policies which cover potential employment-related claims. Perhaps Big Steel Co. is wishing it had had such a policy in place, as they’re facing a hefty pay-out to a vindicated Bottoms.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Free writing and hyperbole are two distinct yet impactful writing techniques used to enhance creativity and expression. Free writing is an unstructured, spontaneous method where a writer writes continuously for a set period without worrying about grammar, spelling, or topic constraints. The goal is to bypass the inner critic and let thoughts flow freely, often leading to unexpected ideas or breakthroughs. It’s commonly used in brainstorming or as a warm-up exercise to overcome writer’s block and encourage raw, authentic expression.\nOn the other hand, hyperbole is a figurative language technique that involves deliberate and obvious exaggeration for emphasis or effect. It is not meant to be taken literally but rather to create a strong impression or convey intense emotions. For example, saying “I’ve told you a million times” exaggerates to highlight frustration. Hyperbole is widely used in poetry, advertising, and everyday speech to add drama or humor.\nWhile free writing encourages the natural emergence of ideas, hyperbole enhances storytelling by intensifying description. Both techniques serve to unlock creativity and engage the reader in different ways.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

[SEP] Response: The Importance of Learning a Second Language\n\nLearning a second language is an important skill in today’s globalized world. It opens up many opportunities, both professionally and personally. People who speak more than one language can communicate with a wider range of people, travel more easily, and understand different cultures. This helps build tolerance and empathy. In the workplace, being bilingual or multilingual can give someone a competitive edge, especially in fields like business, healthcare, and tourism. It also improves cognitive abilities, such as memory, problem-solving, and multitasking. Studies have shown that people who speak more than one language tend to delay the effects of aging on the brain. Learning a new language can be challenging, but with practice and patience, it becomes easier over time. Whether for career advancement, personal growth, or cultural understanding, learning another language is a valuable investment in one’s future. eu agradeço", "task_id": "43d154ea-bd72-4b54-9339-7c12f992b56a", "ef_level": 15.0, "label": 3}

Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: There are several useful techniques for writing. I believe that free writing is the most practical method I have tried. At work, I usually use the technique of free writing when I am faced with a problem. The process, I use for free writing, is perhaps three 3 steps. Firstly, turn on the iPad and open the Notes app. Secondly, just write something that is in my brain in one minute. Thirdly, continuing step 2 till my brain is empty. I tend to do this for around 15 minutes, and it clears my mind. Actually, I learned this method from a book called “Zero Second Thinking”, written by an author from McKinsey, and I’ve been practising it for over 5 years. In fact, I was using this method before I wrote this paragraph.\n\nI am going to explain the two main effects of this method. I think the two main effects are two sides of the same coin. On the one hand, I am able to arrive at the answers or the insights I really had in mind. On the other hand, it helps me to come up with completely new ideas.

Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a trade deal between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, implemented on January 1, 1994. It aimed to eliminate tariffs and trade barriers, fostering economic cooperation among the three nations. NAFTA created one of the world's largest free trade zones, boosting trade and investment across North America.\n\nOne of its key benefits was the removal of tariffs on many goods, making products cheaper for consumers and businesses. It also helped expand supply chains across borders, particularly in industries like automobiles, agriculture, and manufacturing. However, NAFTA faced criticism for job losses in some sectors, especially in U.S. manufacturing, as companies relocated production to Mexico for lower labor costs.\n\nIn 2020, NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which introduced stronger labor protections, updated trade rules for the digital economy, and stricter regulations on the auto industry. While NAFTA played a crucial role in North America's economic growth, the USMCA was designed to address its shortcomings and create a more balanced trade relationship.\n\n\n", "task_id": "8677dea6-ea22-4957-9351-7733852f29a3", "ef_level": 13.0, "label": 5}

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: Write about buying a home and applying for a home loan in your country. How easy or difficult is the process? Are there a lot of forms to fill out? Is housing expensive? What are the interest rates? Do you need to use a real estate agent or mortgage broker? Type in the input box. Write 200-250 words. [SEP] Response: Buying a home in India is a significant financial decision that involves several steps, including selecting the property, securing financing, and completing legal formalities. The process begins with identifying the right location, type of property, and builder or developer reputation. Prospective buyers often conduct thorough market research, assess amenities, and check property prices and appreciation trends.\n\nOnce a property is selected, most buyers opt for a home loan to finance their purchase. Applying for a home loan in India involves approaching banks or financial institutions and submitting necessary documents such as identity proof, income proof, property details, and credit history. The lender evaluates the applicant's creditworthiness, repayment capacity, and property value before sanctioning the loan.\n\nInterest rates for home loans can be fixed or floating, and applicants should compare rates from various lenders to find the best deal. Additionally, understanding loan terms, processing fees, and prepayment options is crucial. After loan approval, the buyer must complete the property's legal due diligence, including title verification and registration.\n\nOwning a home in India is often seen as a milestone, offering both financial security and personal satisfaction.

In Western mythology, they are usually portrayed as fearsome beasts guarding treasures, challenging heroes with their strength and cunning. Conversely, in Eastern traditions, dragons are revered as benevolent and wise, associated with water and weather, bringing prosperity and good fortune. Another legendary creature is the phoenix, a bird that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. According to legend, the phoenix bursts into flames at the end of its life and is reborn from its ashes, symbolizing renewal and immortality. Unicorns, with their single spiraled horn, represent purity and grace, often believed to possess healing powers. These creatures, whether feared or admired, embody the human imagination's boundless creativity and our desire to explain the unknown. They serve as metaphors for human qualities and natural phenomena, enriching our cultural heritage with their timeless stories.

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: In India, robots are increasingly being integrated into various sectors, enhancing efficiency and productivity. In manufacturing, robots are used for tasks such as assembly, welding, and painting, significantly improving precision and reducing human error. The healthcare sector benefits from robotic surgery, which allows for minimally invasive procedures and faster recovery times. Additionally, robots are employed in agriculture for tasks like planting, harvesting, and monitoring crop health, helping to address labor shortages and increase yields. In the service industry, robots are being used for customer service, cleaning, and even food delivery, providing consistent and reliable service.

{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among the nine writing techniques introduced, I find focused free writing and questioning to be the most useful. Focused free writing allows me to explore a topic in depth without worrying about structure or grammar, which helps me uncover ideas I didn’t know I had. It’s especially helpful when I’m stuck or unsure how to begin a piece. By narrowing my attention to a specific subject, I can generate meaningful content while still maintaining the freedom to express myself creatively.\nQuestioning is another technique I rely on often. Asking questions like “Why does this matter?” or “What would happen if…?” helps me dig deeper into a topic and develop a stronger argument or narrative. It encourages critical thinking and helps me see different angles, which is essential for persuasive or reflective writing. While techniques like metaphor and symbolism add flair, I believe focused free writing and questioning are foundational tools that help shape the core of my ideas. They make the writing process more engaging and productive, especially during the early stages of brainstorming and drafting.\n", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

As she stood there, trying to figure out what was going on, the lights in the room flickered and then dimmed. \n\nSuddenly, she felt the tap again, this time on her wrist. Before she could react, she heard a voice whisper, “Don’t look too closely.” \n\nAlex didn’t waste any time — she left the exhibit faster than I’ve ever seen anyone move.

In what ways will they positively and negatively affect society? Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Some look to the stars to spot signs of life on other planets. Others look for signs of a different kind, to the omens and portents they hope will foretell of riches a-waiting, relationships a-coming and fame a-calling. Some look upward to the heavens for such signs; others, inward to visions and inspiration. And the rest of us may look downward at more humble and homely teacups, tarot cards and talismans to find what the future might hold in store.\n\nBy no means a 21st-century phenomenon, means of divining the future have long been part of traditional cultures around the world. People have scoured their dreams for symbols that might unlock what’s around the corner. Some societies have looked to Mother Nature for guidance, reading the entrails of animals or the shapes formed by clouds, shadows cast by stones or yarrow stalks, or scanned upturned palms and faces. These forms of divination have often been associated with people believed, or who believe themselves, to have special gifts of extrasensory perception, or second sight. The role of the priest or priestess, shaman or magician is still central in many societies today, though their responsibilities may now also include here-and-now concerns as well as forebodings.\n\nThroughout history, particular people have been associated with clairvoyant or clairaudient abilities. For the rationalists, these people are no more than charlatans who offer vague and cryptic messages, veiled in metaphor and imagery, open to variable interpretations. To those who feel there is more to this world than the physical eyes can show us, such messengers hold the key to unlocking the future trajectory of our world, and offer hope of averting dangers yet to come.\n\nOne such individual is Nostradamus. Controversy and criticism surround what is known of him. Born Michel de Nostredame in France in the early 16th century, he Latinized his name to Nostradamus for personal reasons. Often depicted as a physician, some historians claim he was thrown out of medical university. On one thing most would agree, however: Nostradamus was an astrologer, looking to the movement of the planets and people’s times of birth to draw up his prognostications. But he has perhaps gained most notoriety not for his glimpses into personal lives, but for his revelations about the future through quatrains, or verse-like commentary.\n\nAttributed to Nostradamus with the benefit of what naysayers call retrospective hindsight are prophesies of world wars, numerous famines and disasters, man’s landing on the moon and the recent collapse of world economies. For non-believers, however, these verses are no more than the ramblings of a man deluded, and the application of creative interpretation on the part of those who wish to believe in Nostradamus’ clairvoyance. Linguists argue his messages were wrapped in such obscurity and metaphorical language that the doors of perception were left wide open for the public to make of them what they would. They point to the wealth of phrases such as ‘and the young lion shall overcome the old’ as his means to figuratively (and some would say, therefore, evasively) refer to a wide spread of people and nations. But when the times get tough and bad things happen to good people, many look to Nostradamus’ writings, imagining they foretold this writing on the wall and heralded apocalyptic news.\n\nHow did Nostradamus make these predictions supposedly ranging from technological advances to world destruction? Reportedly, he stared into water or fire to see these visions, though more extreme believers claim the man was a time traveler! Perhaps there is only one thing we can be truly certain of, however: The debate about the meaning of Nostradamus’ work will continue for as long we have a future!", "task_id": "01e27f6c-3c08-4d7c-8c58-fbe93505be01", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 0}
{"text": "Prompt Level: 16.0 [SEP] Prompt: In the preceding units, nine writing techniques were introduced: metaphor, hyperbole, symbolism, free writing, focused free writing, loop writing, listing, questioning and cubing. Write a paragraph or two explaining which techniques seem most useful to you. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: Among various writing methods, I find free writing and metaphor to be particularly useful. Free writing allows writers to tap into their subconscious mind, generating new ideas and perspectives. By writing freely without stopping or worrying about grammar, spelling, or coherence, writers can overcome writer's block and produce authentic content. This method helps to loosen up the writing muscles, making it easier to express thoughts and feelings.\n\nMetaphor, on the other hand, enables writers to convey complex ideas and emotions in a concise and powerful way. By comparing two unlike things, metaphors create vivid imagery, making writing more engaging and memorable. Metaphors also allow writers to convey subtle shades of meaning, adding depth and nuance to their writing. When combined with free writing, metaphors can help writers to create rich, evocative, and authentic content that resonates with readers. Metaphorical writing uses comparisons to create vivid and evocative language, often to convey complex emotions and ideas.", "task_id": "81ee255e-d4fa-4f81-b77f-dfcf3b5cf541", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 4}

Removing these classes may lead to more stress and less motivation. Test preparation is important, but balancing it with exercise helps students perform better overall. Schools should keep PE and sports alongside test prep.", "task_id": "8dab61c3-5199-4396-87e2-1618ae59b47a", "ef_level": 7.0, "label": 5}

Use some of the language you have learned for criticizing in this lesson. Type in the input box. Write 150-200 words. [SEP] Response: The idea of celebrity often represents the worst aspects of modern society. Celebrities are elevated to an almost godlike status, despite their fame often being based on superficial talents or, at times, pure luck. Take, for example, the endless parade of social media influencers who, by simply posting curated photos or engaging in controversial behavior, achieve millions of followers and, consequently, a platform from which they can promote consumerism, body standards, and lifestyles that are far removed from the reality most people face.\n\nWhat is frustrating is the lack of meaningful contribution to society that many celebrities offer. While there are certainly exceptions, the overwhelming majority spend their time indulging in luxury and self-promotion, with little regard for the issues affecting the world. This reinforces the dangerous idea that fame and wealth are to be admired above all else, diverting attention away from more pressing concerns like education, mental health, and environmental degradation.\n\nThe celebrity culture encourages a toxic obsession with appearance and status, ultimately diminishing our ability to focus on what truly matterspersonal growth, empathy, and social change. In short, the elevation of celebrities can often feel like a reflection of society's misplaced priorities.", "task_id": "121c9e2c-8842-494b-93b1-9af8c82f91f4", "ef_level": 16.0, "label": 5}

The aircraft experienced difficulty maintaining alignment with the runway due to strong crosswinds. Additionally, the tailwinds affected the ground speed, making the touchdown less smooth than expected. The pilot reported unexpected turbulence, likely caused by clear air turbulence (CAT), which added to the challenge of the approach.\n\nThe Instrument Landing System (ILS) was functioning correctly, and weather conditions met the Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) criteria, but the pilot had to rely on Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) due to the rapidly changing wind patterns.\n\nNo injuries or damage were reported.
